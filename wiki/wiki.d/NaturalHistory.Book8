They  are  thought  also  to %0ahave  an  Understanding  of  Religion1  in  others  ;  for  when  they %0aare  to  pass  the  Seas  they  will  not  enter  the  Ships  before  they %0aare  induced  to  it  by  an  Oath  of  their  Governors  that  they %0ashall  return  again;  and  they  have  been  seen  enfeebled  by %0aSickness  (for  as  Large  as  they  are  they  are  subject  to  Sick- %0aness), to  lie  upon  their  Backs,  throwing  up  Herbs  toward %0aHeaven,  as  if  they  had  procured  the  Earth  to  pray  for  them. %0aNow  for  their  Docility  :  they  adore  the  King,  they  kneel  and %0aoffer  Chaplets  of  Flowers.  The  lesser  sort,  which  they  call %0aBastards,  serve  the  Indians  to  Plough  their  Ground. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0a%0aWhen  Elephants  were  first  put  to  Draw. %0a%0aTHE  first  time  they  were  known  to  Draw  at  Rome  was  in %0athe  Chariot  of  Pompey  the  Great,  in  the  African  Triumph. %0a%0a1  The  author  in  several  places  speaks  of  religion  in  animals :  as  of %0amonkeys,  b.  viii.  c.  54,  and  of  barn-door  poultry,  b.  x.  c.  41.  The  oryx %0awas  judged  to  be  impious,  because  it  had  been  seen  to  display  signs  of  dis- %0aregard or  contempt  to  the  moon.  To  understand  the  ground  of  this %0aopinion,  it  is  necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  religion  of  the  heathens %0adid  not  include  or  demand  a  spiritual  attachment,  or  mental  conformity, %0ato  the  character  or  commands  of  the  object  worshipped,  but  was  merely %0aritual :  the  latreia  being  an  official  service  which  was  employed  to  allay %0athe  anger  of  some  divinity,  which  had  been  raised  by  some  cause  equally %0aremote  from  any  feeling  of  a  moral  nature  with  that  instituted  to  obviate %0ait.  The  real  cultus  was  comprised  in  this  ceremony,  and  religion  was  the %0abinding  of  this  cultus,  or  worship,  on  those  who  were  subject  to  it  —  as %0asuperstition  included  the  employment  of  a  greater  amount  of  ceremony %0athan  the  latreia  demanded ;  and  as  this  was  judged  to  proceed  from  a %0agreater  degree  of  fear  than  the  cause  required,  it  was  always  considered %0aas  degrading  him  that  manifested  it.  As  the  proper  idea  of  religion  was %0asupposed  to  be  the  binding  of  the  cultus  on  those  only  who  were  the  sub- %0ajects of  it,  it  was  no  great  extension  of  the  same  principle  to  suppose  that %0aanimals  might  be  subject  to  the  same  laws  as  men  in  these  respects,  and %0athat  they  might  have  recourse  to  means  of  a  similar  kind  to  obviate %0asimilar  offences.  That  the  elephant  practised  religious  rites  was  not  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  5 %0a%0aBut  long  before  this  it  is  said  that  Father  Liber  did  the %0asame  in  his  Triumph  for  having  Conquered  India.  Prod- %0alius  denieth  that,  coupled  as  they  were,  two  in  one  Yoke, %0athey  could  possibly  have  entered  in  at  the  Gates  of  Rome  in %0aPompey's  Triumph.  In  the  Show  of  Gladiators,  which  Ger- %0amanicus  Ccssar  exhibited,  the  Elephants  were  seen  to  show %0asome  disorderly  Motions,  after  a  manner  of  Dancing.  It  was %0aa  common  thing  to  fling  Weapons  through  the  Air,  so  that %0athe  Winds  had  no  power  against  them  ;  to  flourish  and  meet %0atogether  in  Fight  like  Gladiators,  and  to  make  Sport  in  a %0aPyrrhic  Dance ;  and  afterwards  to  go  on  Ropes ;  to  carry %0a(four  together1)  one  of  them  laid  at  ease  in  a  Litter,  re- %0asembling the  manner  of  Women  newly  brought  to  Bed  ;  and %0asome  of  them  would  enter  a  Dining-place  where  the  Tables %0awere  full  of  Guests,  and  pass  among  them  with  their  foot- %0aopinion  of  Pliny  only,  but  appears  to  have  been  common  in  ancient  times. %0a^Elian,  whose  "  History  of  the  Peculiar  Nature  of  Animals  "  is  chiefly %0avaluable  for  containing  everything  on  the  subject  that  floated  on  the  sur- %0aface of  popular  observation,  says,  "  At  the  first  appearance  of  the  new %0amoon  I  have  heard  that  elephants  leave  the  woods  under  the  influence  of %0aa  certain  natural  and  inexpressible  intelligence,  bearing  with  them %0abranches  which  they  have  plucked  from  the  trees,  which  they  bear %0aaloft  and  wave  to  and  fro  as  they  cast  their  looks  upward,  as  if  offering %0asome  divine  intercession  to  the  goddess  to  be  propitious  and  gracious  to %0athem." — B.  iv.  c.  x.  "  They  also  worship  the  rising  sun  by  lifting  up  their %0atrunks,  like  hands,  to  meet  his  rays,  and  on  this  account  they  are  dear  to %0athe  god ;  and  of  this  fact  Ptolemy  Philopator  is  an  excellent  and  un- %0adoubted witness." — B.  vii.  c.  14.  The  reference  of  the  author  to  this  sove- %0areign is  built  on  a  remarkable  dream  which  he  had  on  the  occasion  of %0ahaving  offered  the  unusual  sacrifice  of  four  elephants  on  occasion  of  a %0avictory.  The  solemn  ceremonies  of  the  elephant  on  occasion  of  the  death %0aof  those  of  their  own  kind  are  referred  to  in  the  same  work,  b.  v.  c.  49. %0aTheir  adoration  of  the  king  was  the  result  of  discipline,  b.  xiii.  c.  22  ;  and %0athey  also  formed  his  night-watch,  when  perhaps  he  had  learned  to  dis- %0atrust the  fidelity  of  his  guards. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a1  If  the  elephants  walked  two  and  two,  as  they  probably  did  when %0athus  carrying  their  companion,  there  must  have  been  two  ropes  placed %0ain  parallel  lines.  JElian,  "  De  Animalibus,"  gives  a  most  amusing  account %0aof  the  performances  of  the  elephants  of  Germanicus  in  the  theatre  ;  but  I %0ado  not  remember  that  he  mentions  this  feat.  A  like  exploit  is,  however, %0amentioned  by  Seneca,  Suetonius,  and  others. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a6     .  History  of  Nature.

Mutianus, %0awho  had  been  thrice  Consul,  reporteth  that  one  of  them  had %0aLearned  to  make  the  Greek  Letters,  and  was  accustomed  to %0aWrite  in  that  Language  thus:  This  have  I  myself  written, %0aand  have  dedicated  the  Celtic  spoils.  Also  himself  saw  at %0aPuteoli,  when  some  Elephants  that  had  been  brought %0athither  were  forced  to  go  forth  out  of  the  Vessel  in  which %0athey  had  come,  but  being  affrighted  at  the  extent  of  the  way %0afrom  the  Ship  to  the  Land,  to  deceive  themselves  so  that %0athe  way  might  not  seem  too  long,  they  went  backward  with %0atheir  Tails  to  the  Land.  They  know  that  the  Riches  for %0awhich  Men  lie  in  wait  for  them  consisteth  only  in  their %0aArms,  which  Juba  calleth  their  Horns  ;  but  which  Herodotus, %0awho  wrote  long  before  him,  and  custom,  hath  better  termed %0aTeeth.  And  therefore  when  they  are  fallen  off,  either  from %0aAge,  or  by  some  Accident,  the  Elephants  themselves  hide %0athem  in  the  Ground.  And  this  is  the  only  Ivory ;  for  all  the %0arest,  and  the  Teeth  themselves  so  far  as  they  are  covered %0awithin  the  Flesh,  is  no  better  than  common  Bone.  And  yet %0aof  late  for  scarcity  Men  have  taken  up  to  cut  the  Bones  into %0aPlates.  For  it  is  rare  to  procure  Teeth  of  any  bigness  except %0afrom  India ;  since  all  the  rest  in  our  part  of  the  World  hath %0a%0a1  Plutarch,  "  De  Solert.  Anim."  tells  us  of  an  elephant  who  practised %0abis  parts  by  moonlight  of  his  own  accord.—  Wern.

You  may  know  young  Ele- %0aphants by  the  Whiteness  of  their  Teeth,  and  these  Beasts %0ahave  a  special  care  over  them.  They  spare  the  Point  of  one %0aof  them,  lest  it  should  be  blunt  when  they  come  to  Fight ; %0aand  the  other  they  use  ordinarily,  either  to  dig  up  Roots  or %0ato  throw  down  Banks.  When  they  are  compassed  round %0awith  Hunters,  they  set  in  the  foremost  rank  those  which %0ahave  the  least  Teeth,  that  their  price  may  not  be  thought %0aworth  the  hazard  of  Battle.  But  afterwards,  when  they  are %0aweary,  they  break  them  by  driving  them  into  the  Trees,  and %0aso  ransom  themselves  by  the  prey. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0a%0aThe  Clemency  of  Elephants ;    their  Knowledge  of  their  own %0aDangers  ;  also  the  Fierceness  of  the  Tiyer. %0a%0aIT  is  a  wonder  in  most  Animals  that  they  know  why  they %0aare  Hunted ;  and  through  the  whole  they  understand  what %0ato  guard  against.  If  an  Elephant  chance  to  meet  a  Man %0awandering  simply  out  of  his  way  in  the  Wilderness,  it  is  said %0athat  he  will  mildly  and  peaceably  set  him  in  the  right  way %0aagain.  But  if  he  perceive  a  Man's  footstep  before  he  dis- %0acovers the  Man,  he  will  tremble  for  fear  of  being  entrapped ; %0ahe  will  stay  from  the  Scent,  look  about  him  every  way,  and %0apuff  for  very  anger.  Neither  will  he  tread  upon  the  Track,  but %0adig  it  out  and  give  it  to  the  next  (Elephant),  and  he  again  to %0ahim  that  followeth,  in  the  way  of  a  Message,  to  the  furthest %0arank  behind.  Then  the  whole  Herd  wheels  round  and  re- %0aturns backward,  putting  themselves  in  Battle  Array  :  so  long %0acontinueth  that  strong  Smell  of  Men's  Feet  through  them %0aall,  notwithstanding  for  the  most  part  they  have  not  naked %0aFeet,  So  the  Tigress  also,  though  fierce  to  other  wild %0aBeasts,  and  disregarding  the  footsteps  of  the  Elephant %0aitself,  if  she  happen  to  catch  sight  of  a  Man  is  said  im- %0amediately to  convey  away  her  Whelps.  How  cometh %0ashe  to  this  knowledge  of  a  Man  ?  Where  did  she  ever  see %0ahim  before  whom  she  thus  feareth  ?  For  surely  such  Forests %0a%0a%0a8  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VIII. %0a%0aare  very  little  frequented  by  Men.  They  may  indeed  well %0awonder  at  the  novelty  of  their  Tracks,  bat  how  know  they %0athat  they  are  to  be  feared  ?  Nay,  what  should  be  the  reason %0athat  they  dread  even  to  see  a  Man,  being  so  much  superior %0ain  Strength,  Size,  and  Swiftness  ?  Certainly  herein  is  the %0awonderful  work  of  Nature,  and  her  mighty  Power ;  that  the %0agreatest  and  fiercest  of  wild  Beasts,  which  have  never  seen %0athat  which  they  ought  to  fear,  yet  immediately  understand %0awhy  the  same  is  to  be  dreaded. %0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0aThe  Understanding  and  Memory  of  Elephants. %0a%0aELEPHANTS  march  always  in  Troops.  The  oldest  of  them %0aleadeth  the  Company,  and  the  next  to  him  in  age  cometh %0abehind  with  the  conduct  of  the  Rear.  When  they  are  to  pass %0aover  a  River,  they  put  the  Smallest  foremost,  lest  if  the %0aLarger  should  enter  first  they  would  dig  up  the  Channel,  and %0aso  make  the  Torrent  to  become  deeper.  Anti.pat.er  writeth, %0athat  King  Antiochus  had  two  Elephants  which  he  used  in %0ahis  Wars,  and  were  famous  for  their  Surnames,  which  they %0aknew  well.  And  truly  Cato,  when  he  named  in  his  Annals %0athe  Commanders  (Imperators),  hath  recorded  that  the  (Ele- %0aphant) which  fought  most  bravely  in  the  Punic  Contest  was %0anamed  Surus,  and  that  one  of  his  Teeth  was  lost.  When %0aAntiochus  would  have  sounded  the  passage  of  a  River  (by %0aputting  the  Elephants  before),  Ajax  refused,  although  at  all %0atimes  he  was  the  leader  of  the  Troop.  On  this  it  was  pro- %0anounced that  the  Elephant  which  would  pass  should  be  the %0aChief;  and  Patroclus  having  ventured,  as  a  reward  there %0awas  presented  to  him  a  rich  set  of  Silver  Trappings  (a  thing %0ain  which  they  take  very  great  Delight) ;  and  besides  this, %0ahe  was  made  the  Sovereign  of  the  others.  But  the  other, %0awhich  was  distinguished  (by  his  Abstaining  from  Food)  pre- %0aferred Death  to  the  Shame :  for  they  are  wonderfully %0aBashful,  so  that  if  one  of  them  be  overcome  he  will  fly  from %0athe  voice  of  the  Conqueror,  and  put  forward  Earth  arid  Ver- %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  9 %0a%0avain.1  Through  Modesty  they  never  associate  in  Love  except %0ain  secret :  the  Male  at  five  Years  of  Age,  and  the  Female  at %0aten  Years  old.  And  this  they  do  every  third  Year,2  and  they %0acontinue  therein  five  Days  in  the  Year  (as  they  say)  and  not %0amore,  for  upon  the  sixth  Day  they  Wash  themselves  over  in %0athe  River  ;  and  before  this  they  do  not  return  to  the  Herd. %0aThey  know  no  adulterous  change  ;  neither  are  there  any %0aBattles  among  them  about  their  Females,  as  among  other %0aAnimals  to  their  great  injury.  And  this  is  not  for  want  of %0astrong  Affection ;  for  it  is  reported  of  an  Elephant  that  he %0awas  enamoured  of  a  certain  Woman  in  Egypt  who  sold  Gar- %0alands of  Flowers.  And  lest  any  one  should  think  that  she %0awas  an  ordinary  maiden  that  was  beloved,  she  was  greatly %0aadmired  by  Aristophanes,  the  excellent  Grammarian.  There %0awas  another  so  full  of  Love  to  a  Youth  in  the  Army  of  Ptolo- %0amceus,  that  if  he  did  not  see  him  every  Day  he  would  abstain %0afrom  his  Meat.  Juba  likewise  reporteth  of  an  Elephant  that %0aloved  a  Woman  who  sold  Perfumes.  All  these  shewed  their %0aLove  by  the  tokens  of  Joy  at  the  sight  of  the  object  of  their %0aregard,  by  their  rude  Blandishments,  and  by  preserving  the %0aGifts  which  the  People  gave  them,  and  laying  them  in  their %0aBosoms.  Nor  is  Love  so  much  to  be  wondered  at  where  the %0aMemory  is  so  good.  For  the  same  Juba  saith,  that  an  Ele- %0aphant acknowledged  a  Man  in  his  old  Age,  and  after  many %0aYears,  who  in  his  youth  had  been  his  Governor.  He %0aaffirmeth  also  that  they  have  a  certain  Divine  Instinct  of %0aJustice  :  for  when  King  Bacchus  had  appointed  to  be  re- %0avenged on  thirty  Elephants,  which  he  had  caused  to  be %0abound  to  Stakes,  and  had  set  the  same  number  to  run  upon %0athem,  appointing  also  Men  to  urge  them  to  rush  forward ; %0ayet  they  were  riot  able  to  cause  them  to  become  the  Ministers %0aof  another's  Cruelty. %0a%0a1  The  greatest  sign  of  victory  in  old  time  was  for  the  vanquished  to %0aoffer  a  plant  to  the  conqueror,  which  signified  that  he  surrendered  all  the %0ainterests  he  had  in  earth,  and  even  the  rite  of  burial.

[BooK  VIII. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VI. %0a%0aWhen  Elephants  were  first  seen  in  Italy. %0a%0aTHE  first  Time  that  Elephants  were  seen  in  Italy  was %0aduring  the  War  of  King  Pyrrhus ;  and  they  were  called  by %0athe  Name  of  Lucce  Boves,  or  Lucan  Oxen,  because  they  were %0aseen  in  the  Lucan  Country  ;  in  the  four  hundred  and  seventy- %0asecond  Year  of  the  City.  But  in  Rome  it  was  seven  Years %0aafter  this  before  they  were  seen,  and  then  in  a  Triumph.  But %0ain  the  Year  502,  a  Number  of  them  were  seen,  being  taken %0afrom  the  Carthaginians  in  the  Victory  of  L.  Metellus  Pontifex %0ain  Sicily.  142  were  conveyed  over  on  Rafts,  which  were  laid %0aupon  Rows  of  great  Tuns  placed  close  one  by  another.  Ver- %0arius  saith  that  they  fought  in  the  Circus,  and  were  killed  with %0aDarts,  for  want  of  better  Counsel  ;  for  they  were  neither %0awilling  to  feed  them,1  nor  to  bestow  them  upon  Kings.  L.  Piso %0asaith  they  were  only  brought  out  into  the  Circus ;  and  to %0amake  them  contemptible,  they  were  driven  round  it  by  cer- %0atain hired  Fellows,  having  for  that  purpose  Spears  simply %0aheaded  with  Iron.  But  what  became  of  them  afterward, %0athose  Authors  make  no  mention ;  but  they  are  of  opinion, %0athat  they  were  not  killed. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aTheir  Combats. %0a%0aMUCH  renowned  is  the  Contest  of  one  Roman  with  an %0aElephant,  when  Annibal  forced  our  Captives  to  skirmish  one %0aagainst  another.  For  the  only  Roman  that  remained,  he %0amatched  with  an  Elephant,  having  covenanted  with  him, %0a%0a1  The  Romans  might  well  shrink  from  the  expense  of  supporting  142 %0aelephants,  when,  as  we  are  informed,  the  quantity  of  food  required  for  the %0adaily  consumption  of  a  full-grown  elephant  is  not  less  than  200  pounds  of %0aaliment  of  all  sorts.  The  elephant  of  Louis  XIV.  had  daily  80  pounds %0aof  bread,  12  pints  of  wine,  and  a  large  quantity  of  vegetable  soup,  with %0abread  and  rice ;  this  was  exclusive  of  grass,  and  what  he  got  from  visi- %0ators. —  Wcrn.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIIL]  History  of  Nature.  1 1 %0a%0athat  if  he  could  kill  the  Beast,  he  should  be  dismissed.  So %0athis  Prisoner  entered  into  single  Fight  with  the  Elephant, %0aand  to  the  great  Grief  of  the  Carthaginians,  slew  him.  An- %0anibal,  considering  that  the  Report  of  this  Combat  would %0acause  these  Beasts  to  be  little  regarded,  sent  after  him  some %0aLight  Horsemen  to  kill  him  upon  the  Way.  Their  Trunk %0a(Proboscis)  may  be  easily  cut  off;  as  appeared  by  Experience %0ain  the  Battles  of  Pyrrhus.  Fenestella  writeth,  that  the  first %0aFight  of  them  in  Rome  was  in  the  Circus,  when  Claudius %0aPulcker  was  Curule  jEdile,  and  M.  Antonius  and  A.  Post- %0ahumius  were  Consuls,  in  the  six  hundred  and  fiftieth  Year %0aof  the  City.  Also  20  Years  after,  when  the  Luculli  were %0aCurule  .ZEdiles,  they  fought  against  Bulls.  Also  in  the %0asecond  Consulship  of  Cn.  Pompeius,  at  the  Dedication  of  the %0aTemple  to  Venus  Victoress,  20  of  them,  or  as  some  write,  17, %0afought  in  the  Circus.  The  Gaetulians  threw  Darts  against %0athem.  But  one  Elephant  did  Wonders :  for  when  his  Feet %0awere  pierced  through  with  Darts,  he  crept  upon  his  Knees %0aamong  the  Companies,  where  he  caught  from  them  their %0aShields,  and  flung  them  aloft,  which,  as  they  fell,  turned %0around  as  if  by  Art,  and  not  as  if  thrown  with  Violence  by %0athe  Beasts  in  their  Anger,  to  the  great  Pleasure  of  the  Be- %0aholders. And  as  strange  a  Thing  was  seen  in  another  of %0athem,  who  was  killed  with  one  Stroke ;  for  the  Dart  was %0adriven  under  the  Eye,  and  pierced  to  the  vital  Parts  of  the %0aHead.  Whereupon  all  the  rest  endeavoured  to  burst  away, %0anot  without  a  great  disturbance  among  the  People,  although %0afenced  round  with  Iron  Bars.  And  for  this  Cause,  Ccesar %0athe  Dictator,  when  afterwards  he  was  about  to  exhibit  the %0alike  Show,  cast  a  Ditch  round  about  the  Arena ;  which  Prince %0aNero  removed  to  make  room  for  the  Knights.  But  those %0aElephants  of  Pompey  being  past  all  Hope  of  escaping,  in  a %0aManner  that  cannot  be  expressed  seemed  to  supplicate  the %0aMultitude,  craving  their  Mercy,  with  grievous  Lamentations %0abewailing  their  Condition ;  so  that  the  People's  Hearts %0amelted,  and  with  Tears  in  their  Eyes,  they  rose  up  all  at %0aonce,  without  Regard  to  the  Imperator,  or  Respect  to  his %0amagnificent  Display,  and  imprecated  on  Pompey  these  severe %0a%0a%0a12  History  of  Nature.

Again, %0aCcesar  the  Dictator,  in  his  third  Consulship,  exhibited  ano- %0ather Fight  of  them ;  20  against  500  Footmen  ;  and  a  second %0aTime  20  more,  having  Turrets  with  60  Defendants  to  the %0asame ;  and  he  opposed  against  them  the  same  Number  as %0athe  former  of  Footmen,  and  as  many  Horse.  After  this, %0aClaudius  and  JVero,  the  Princes,  brought  them  forth  one  by %0aone,  by  way  of  finishing  the  Show  of  Gladiators.  This %0aAnimal  is  reported  to  be  so  gentle  to  all  that  are  not  so %0astrong  as  himself,  that  if  he  meet  a  Flock  of  Cattle,  he  will %0awith  the  Hand  remove  any  that  cometh  in  his  Way,  for  Fear %0ahe  should  crush  them  without  being  aware  of  it.  And  they %0anever  do  any  Hurt  unless  provoked.  They  always  walk  in %0aTroops,  and  are  less  disposed  to  wandering  alone  than  any %0aother  Animals.  If  they  are  environed  with  Horsemen,  they %0atake  into  the  midst  of  the  Troop  the  feeble,  weary,  or  wounded ; %0aand  as  if  they  were  under  the  Direction  of  a  General,  or  with %0athe  Guidance  of  Reason,  they  succeed  one  another  in  their %0aCourse.  When  taken,  they  are  soonest  brought  to  be  tame %0awith  the  Juice  of  Barley.1 %0a%0aCHAPTER  VIII. %0aThe  Manner  of  taking  Elephants. %0a%0aTHE  Indians  take  Elephants  in  this  manner :  the  Go- %0avernor employeth  one  of  them  that  are  tame,  and  when  he %0ameeteth  with  a  wild  one  alone,  or  can  single  him  from  the %0aHerd,  he  beateth  him  until  he  hath  made  him  weary,  and %0athen  he  mounteth  on  him  and  ruleth  him  as  well  as  the  former. %0aIn  Africa  they  catch  them  in  Pit-falls;  into  which,  if  one  of %0athem  wander,  all  the  rest  immediately  heap  together  Boughs %0aof  Trees,  they  roll  down  Heaps,  they  raise  Banks,  and  with %0aall  they  can  do,  labour  to  draw  him  out.  Formerly  when %0athey  meant  to  make  them  tractable,  by  the  Help  of  Horse- %0amen they  drove  the  Flocks  along  into  a  Valley  made  by %0aMan's  Hand,  and  calculated  to  deceive  them  for  a  consider- %0a%0a1  That  is,  gruel,  or  tissane,  as  we  may  suppose.  —  Wern.

But  now,  since  they %0aseek  after  them  for  the  sake  of  their  Teeth,  they  throw  Darts %0aat  their  Legs,  which  are  the  softest  Part  of  their  Body.  The %0aTrogloditee,1  a  People  bordering  on  Ethiopia,  who  live  only %0aby  hunting  Elephants,  climb  the  Trees  that  are  near  their %0aWalk,  and  from  thence  watching  all  the  Herd  as  they  pass, %0athey  leap  down  upon  the  Buttocks  of  the  hindmost;  then  he, %0awith  his  left  Hand,  layeth  hold  of  the  Tail,  and  setteth  his %0aFeet  fast  in  the  Flank  of  the  left  Side ;  and  so  hanging,  with %0ahis  right  Hand  he  cutteth  the  Hamstrings  of  one  of  his  Legs %0awith  a  very  sharp  double-edged  Knife ;  which  done,  the %0aElephant  slackening  his  Pace,  the  Man  then  maketh  escape, %0aand  divideth  the  Sinews  likewise  of  the  other  Ham  ;  and  all %0athis  Execution  he  doth  with  wonderful  Agility.  Others  have %0aa  safer  Way  than  this,  but  it  is  more  deceitful :  they  fix  in %0athe  Ground  a  great  Way  off,  very  great  Bows  ready  bent; %0ato  hold  these  fast  they  choose  young  Men  remarkable  for %0atheir  Strength,  and  others  united  together  draw  with  all %0aMight  these  Bows  against  the  first,  and  so  they  pierce  the %0aElephants  as  they  pass  with  Javelins,  and  then  follow  them %0aby  their  Blood.  Of  these  Creatures,  the  Females  are  much %0amore  fearful  than  the  Males. %0a%0a1  These  people  are  often  mentioned  by  Pliny,  and  are  particularly %0adescribed  by  Heliodorus  (2Ethiopics,  b.  viii.) :  "  They  are  a  people  of %0aEthiopia,  and  live  by  grazing.  These  people  are  extremely  swift  of  foot, %0aas  well  by  nature  as  by  continued  exercise  from  their  childhood :  of  little %0ause  in  close  fight,  but  very  serviceable  with  their  slings,  which  they  gall %0atheir  enemy  with  at  a  distance ;  and  if  they  find  themselves  overpowered, %0athey  fly,  secured  by  their  swiftness,  and  by  running  into  holes  and  caverns %0aamong  the  rocks,  where  no  enemy  ever  found  it  worth  their  while  to  follow %0athem."  The  Agagees,  as  mentioned  by  Mr.  Bruce,  in  his  "  Travels  into %0aAbyssinia,"  appear  to  be  a  similar  race  of  men ;  although  the  object  of %0apursuit  is  a  different  animal.  —  Wern.

[  BOOK  VIII. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0aThe  Manner  of  Taming  Elephants. %0a%0aAs  furious  as  they  may  be,  they  are  tamed  with  Hunger %0aand  Stripes,  and  by  the  Help  of  other  Elephants  that  are %0abrought  to  them,  to  restrain  the  unruly  Beast  with  Chains ; %0aand  at  other  Times,  when  they  go  to  rut,  they  are  most  out %0aof  Order  ;  so  that  they  demolish  the  Stables  with  their  Teeth  : %0aand  therefore  they  restrain  them  from  their  Heat,  and  sepa- %0arate the  Inclosures  of  the  Females  apart  from  those  of  the %0aMales,  which  Enclosures  they  have  much  in  the  Mariner  of %0aother  Beasts.  When  tamed,  they  serve  in  War,  and  carry %0alittle  Castles  with  armed  Soldiers  among  the  Enemies  j1  and %0afor  the  most  Part  they  decide  the  Wars  of  the  East.  They %0abear  down  the  Body  of  the  Army,  and  stamp  them  (the %0aarmed  Men)  under  Foot.  But  these  same  are  affrighted %0awith  the  Grunting  of  Swine  ;  and  if  wounded  or  put  into %0aa  Fright,  they  always  go  backward,  with  scarcely  less  Mis- %0achief to  their  own  Side.  The  African  Elephants  are  afraid %0aof  the  Indian,  and  dare  not  look  upon  them  ;  for  the  Indian %0aElephants  are  much  bigger.2 %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0a%0aHow  they  Bring  forth  their  Young;  and  of  other  Parts  of %0atheir  Nature. %0a%0aIT  is  the  common  Opinion  that  they  go  with  Young  ten %0aYears ;  but  Aristotle  saith,  that  they  go  but  two  Years,  and %0a%0a1  Or  on  their  backs  (a  various  reading),  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a2  Philostratus  and  Polybius  confirm  this  statement  of  Pliny,  that  the %0aIndian  elephant  is  larger  than  that  of  Africa ;  and  ^Elian  says,  that  it %0aattains  the  height  of  nine  cubits.    But  modern  authors  generally  consider %0athe  African  species  the  larger, — at  least  larger  than  the  common  elephant %0aof  Hindostan.     Mr.  Corse,  formerly  superintendent  of  the  East  India %0aCompany's  elephants  at  Tiperah,  a  province  of  Bengal,  never  heard  of %0abut  one  Indian  elephant  whose  height  reached  ten  feet  six  inches.     The %0aelephants  of  Hindostan  are,  however,  the  smallest  of  the  Asiatic  species. %0aThose  of  Pegu  and  Ava  are  much  larger  ;  and  the  skeleton  of  the  elephant %0aat  the  Museum  of  Petersburgh,  which  was  sent  to  the  Czar  Peter  by  the %0aKing  of  Persia,  measures  sixteen  feet  and  a  half  in  height.  —  Wern.

Their  Condition  of  Youth  beginneth  when  they %0aare  threescore  Years  old  :  they  greatly  delight  in  Rivers,  and %0athey  wander  about  Waters  ;  when  otherwise,  by  reason  of  the %0aMagnitude  of  their  Bodies,  they  cannot  swim.1  They  are %0aimpatient  of  Cold.  The  greatest  Evil  which  befals  them  is, %0aDistension  and  Purging  of  the  Bowels ;  nor  do  they  suffer %0afrom  any  other  kinds  of  Sickness.  I  find  that  if  they  drink  Oil, %0athe  Darts  which  stick  in  their  Bodies  will  fall  off,  but  if  they %0asweat  the  more  easily  will  they  hold  fast.  The  eating  of %0aEarth  causes  wasting  in  them,  unless  they  chew  well  and %0aoften  :  they  devour  Stones  also.  The  Trunks  of  Trees  is  the %0abest  Meat  they  have.  They  will  overturn  the  higher  Palm- %0atrees  with  their  Forehead,  and  eat  the  Dates  as  they  lie %0aalong.  They  chew  their  Meat  with  their  Mouth  :  but  they %0abreathe,  drink,  and  smell  with  what  is  not  improperly  called %0atheir  Hand.  Of  all  living  Creatures  they  most  detest  a %0aMouse;2  and  if  they  perceive  that  their  Provender  lying  in %0athe  Manger  hath  been  touched  by  it,  they  will  not  touch  it. %0aThey  are  mightily  tormented  with  Pain,  if  in  their  drinking %0athey  swallow  down  a  Leech  ;  which  Creature,  I  observe,  they %0abegin  now  commonly  to  call  a  Bloodsucker,  (Sanyuisuga) : %0afor  when  the  Leech  hath  fixed  itself  in  the  Windpipe,  it  put- %0ateth  him  to  intolerable  Pain.  The  Hide  of  their  Back  is %0amost  hard;3  but  in  the  Belly  it  is  soft;  their  Skin  has  no %0acovering  of  Hair ;  and  even  in  their  Tail  there  is  no  Defence %0awhich  might  serve  to  drive  away  the  Annoyance  of  Flies  (for %0aas  huge  a  Beast  as  he  is,  he  feeleth  it) ;  but  their  Skin  is  full %0a%0a1  It  scarcely  needs  be  observed  that  the  elephant  swims  as  well  as %0aany  other  quadruped.  In  this  act  he  will  frequently  immerse  his  whole %0abody,  so  that  the  tip  of  his  trunk  only  is  above  water,  to  the  no  slight %0ainconvenience  of  those  who  chance  to  be  riding  on  his  back.  —  Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a3  JElian  says  (B.  i.  c.  38),  that  it  dreads  the  grunting  of  a  hog,  and  a %0ahorned  ram ;  and  it  was  by  employing  these  that  the  Romans  put  to  flight %0athe  elephants  of  King  Pyrrhus,  by  which  they  obtained  a  decisive  victory. %0a—  Wern.

When  the  elephants  approach  to  feed  on  the  branches, %0athe  enemy  seizes  them  about  the  eyes,  twines  itself  about  the  neck,  and %0alashes  them  with  its  tail,  in  which  manner  they  fall  down  strangled. — %0aWern.

The %0aDragon,  therefore,  espying  the  Elephant  going  to  its  Food, %0athroweth  itself  on  it  from  a  high  Tree ;  this  Creature, %0aknowing  its  Inability  by  struggling  to  withstand  the  other's %0aWindings  about  it,  seeketh  to  crush  its  Enemy  against  the %0aTrees  or  Rocks.  The  Dragons  guard  against  this  by  en- %0atangling its  Progress  first  with  their  Tail;  the  Elephants %0aundo  those  Knots  with  their  Hand :  but  the  Dragons  put %0atheir  Heads  into  their  Snout,  and  so  shut  out  their  Breath, %0aand  tear  the  tenderest  Parts.  When  these  two  chance  to %0aencounter  each  other  on  the  Way,  the  Dragons  raise  them- %0aselves against  their  Enemies,  and  aim  chiefly  at  the  Eyes, %0awhereby  it  happeneth  that  many  Times  they  (the  Ele- %0aphants) are  found  blind,  and  worn  away  with  Hunger %0aand  Grief.

Thus  are  they  sucked  dry  by  them  until %0athey  fall  down  dead  ;  and  the  Dragons  thus  drunken,  are %0acrushed  under  them,  and  both  die  together. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIII. %0aOf  Dragons.* %0a%0aIN  Ethiopia  there  are  produced  as  great  Dragons  as  in %0aIndia,  being  twenty  Cubits  long.  But  I  chiefly  wonder  at %0athis  one  Thing:  why  Juba  should  think  they  were  Crested. %0aThey  are  produced  most  in  a  Country  of  Ethiopia,  where  the %0aPeople  called  Asachsei  inhabit.  It  is  reported,  that  upon %0atheir  Coasts  they  enwrap  themselves  four  or  five  together, %0ain  the  manner  of  a  Bundle  of  Rods,  and  thus  pass  the  Seas, %0ato  find  better  Pasturage  in  Arabia,  bearing  up  their  Heads %0aaloft  as  they  cross  the  Waves. %0a%0a1  Dragons  are  often  mentioned  by  ancient  authors,  but  without  any %0amarks  by  which  we  can  distinguish  them  from  other  kinds  of  serpents. %0aTheir  bulk  did  not  constitute  the  distinction,  for  the  bose  mentioned  in %0athe  following  chapter  are,  at  least,  equally  large.  The  idea  of  ferocity %0aseems  more  directly  to  mix  itself  with  this  class  of  reptiles ;  and  accord- %0aingly in  the  Septuagint  version  of  the  Scriptures  this  is  the  impression %0ausually  implied  in  the  term.  In  the  29th  chapter  of  the  prophecy  of %0aEzekiel  the  crocodile  is  signified  by  that  name,  as  it  is  also  by  Marco %0aPolo  in  his  travels ;  but  in  Revel,  c.  xx.  as  in  the  more  ancient  books  of %0aScripture,  a  large  serpent  is  distinctly  characterised.  Among  the  remark- %0aable things  at  Rome  in  the  days  when  the  strangest  things  were  sought %0aout  to  gratify  extravagant  curiosity,  Suetonius  says  that  Tiberius  pos- %0asessed a  tame  dragon ;  and  Martial  (Ep.  b.  vii.  c.  70)  makes  it  the  play- %0athing of  a  lady :— "  Si  gelidum  collo  nectit  Glacilla  Draconem."  The %0adragon,  as  a  winged  serpent,  was  in  the  middle  ages  often  represented  by %0athe  skin  of  a  skate,  distorted  and  cut  into  form,  by  which  the  opinion  of %0a?uch  a  monstrous  shape  was  spread  among  the  public. —  Wern.

Metrodorus  saith  that  about  the  River %0aRhyndacus,  in  Pontus,  there  are  Serpents  which  catch  and %0adevour  the  Fowls  of  the  Air  as  they  fly  over  them,  however %0ahigh  or  rapid  their  Flight  may  be.  It  is  well  known  that %0aRegulus,  Imperator  during  the  Wars  against  the  Cartha- %0aginians, near  the  River  Bograda  assailed  a  Serpent  with  his %0aMilitary  Engines,  the  Balistae  and  Tormentum,  as  he  would %0ahave  done  to  a  Town  ;  and  when  Subdued,  the  Length  of  the %0aSerpent  was  found  to  be  120  Feet.  The  Skin  and  Jaws  of %0athis  Serpent  were  preserved  in  a  Temple  at  Rome  until  the %0aWar  of  Numantia.  And  this  is  rendered  the  more  credible %0afrom  the  Serpents  that  we  see  in  Italy  that  are  called  Boae, %0awhich  increase  to  such  Size,  that  in  the  Days  of  the  Prince %0aDlvus  Claudius  there  was  one  of  them  killed  in  the %0aVatican,  within  the  Belly  of  which  there  was  found  an  In- %0afant Child.  They  are  nourished  at  the  first  by  the  Milk  of %0athe  Cow,  from  whence  they  take  their  Name.  As  for  other %0aAnimals,  which  of  late  are  often  brought  from  all  Parts  into %0aItaly,  it  is  needless  for  me  to  describe  their  Forms  par- %0aticularly. %0a%0a1  The  monstrous  serpents  recorded  by  ancient  authors,  as  Aristotle, %0aVirgil,  Livy,  Pliny,  and  others,  were  probably  of  the  family  of  bose. %0aPliny  gives  here  the  derivation  of  the  name  "  boa,"  and  Johnson,  "  Dei- %0aparse  de  Urseolo,"  and  others  observe  that  the  name  is  derived  not  so %0amuch  from  the  power  the  animals  have  of  swallowing  oxen,  as  from  a %0astrong  opinion  in  old  times  of  their  following  the  herds,  and  sucking  their %0audders.  Cuvier  says  the  boae  are  among  the  largest  of  serpents.  Some %0aof  the  species  attain  to  thirty  or  forty  feet  in  length,  and  become  capable %0aof  swallowing  dogs,  deer,  and  even  oxen,  after  having  crushed  them  in %0atheir  folds,  and  lubricated  them  with  their  saliva.  The  class  of  bose,  as %0aanciently  understood,  has  been  divided  by  Cuvier  into  two,  boa  and %0apython :  to  which  latter  this  author  supposes  that  serpent  to  have  belonged %0awhich  offered  so  formidable  a  resistance  to  the  army  of  Regulus.  Such %0aenormous  serpents  have  long  since  ceased  to  exist  in  Italy. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a9Q  History  of  Nature.

Few  likewise  are  in  Germany,  bor- %0adering on  it;  but  that  Country  possesseth  some  remark- %0aable kinds  of  Wild  Cattle,  as  the  Maned  Bisons,1  and  the %0aUrus,  of  very  great  Strength  and  Swiftness,  which  ignorant %0a%0a1  Urus  Bonasus.  Much  doubt  has  existed  with  regard  to  the %0adistinction  between  these  three  supposed  species  of  oxen,  which  Cuvier %0aresolves  into  two,  the  Bos  Bonasus  of  Linneus;  Zubr,  or  European %0aBison;  and  the  Urus,  mentioned  in  ancient  times  by  Caesar.  The %0aformer  animal  once  roamed  over  the  woodland  districts  of  Central %0aEurope,  and  in  England  was  contemporary  with  the  extinct  races %0aof  elephant  and  rhinoceros ;  but  it  is  now  confined  to  the  forest  of %0aBialowicza,  in  the  government  of  Grodno,  where  it  is  carefully  pro- %0atected by  the  imperial  government,  whose  strict  enactments  alone  have %0asaved  it  from  extirpation.  In  Owen's  "  History  of  British  Fossil  Mam- %0amalia," p.  491,  &c.  the  remains  of  animals  of  this  species  are  described %0aas  those  of  the  Bison  Priscus;  and  they  are  found  in  "  various  newer  ter- %0atiary fresh -water  deposits,  especially  in  Kent  and  Essex,  and  along  the %0avalley  of  the  Thames."  A  young  male  and  female  were  presented  to  the %0aZoological  Society  of  London,  by  the  Emperor  of  Russia,  in  the  year %0a1847.  Aristotle  calls  it  Bonasos,  or  Monassos,  and  describes  it  as  living %0ain  Pa3onia,  the  modern  Bulgaria;  but  the  distance  to  which,  in  terror,  it %0avoids  its  excrements,  is  more  moderately  represented  by  him  as  four %0afathoms  ;  which  Pliny  extends  to  no  less  than  "  tria  jugera,"  or  a  space  of %0a700  feet.  The  Urus,  also  a  large  species  of  wild  ox,  ranged  the  forests  of %0aGermany  and  Belgium  till  a  late  period  of  the  Roman  empire,  but  is  now %0aextinct.  Its  fossil  remains,  under  the  name  of  Bos  Primigemus,  are  found %0aby  Professor  Owen  in  the  same  deposits  and  localities  as  those  of  the %0aAurochs,  or  Bison.  The  Urus  was  almost  equal  in  size  to  the  Aurochs, %0abut  differed  from  it  precisely,  as  the  Roman  poets  and  historians  have %0aindicated,  by  the  greater  length  of  its  horns,  and  by  the  absence  of  a %0acopious  mane.  It  appears  to  have  had  a  nearer  affinity  to  the  domestic %0aox,  resembling  it  probably  in  the  close  nature  of  its  hairy  covering. %0aCuvier,  Professor  Bell,  and  other  naturalists,  are  disposed  to  believe  that %0aour  domestic  cattle  are  the  degenerate  descendants  of  the  Urus,  but  with %0athis  opinion  Professor  Owen  does  not  concur ;  and  they  are  more  probably %0ato  be  referred  to  the  wild  cattle  still  preserved  in  the  park  at  Shering- %0aham. —  Wern.

Their  upper  Lip  is  exceeding %0aGreat,  and  therefore  as  they  Feed  they  go  backward  ;  for  if %0athey  passed  forward,  it  would  be  folded  double.  There  is %0a(they  say)  a  Wild  Beast  in  Paeonia,  which  is  called  Bonasus, %0awith  a  Mane  like  an  Horse,  but  otherwise  resembling  a %0aBull ;  arid  his  Horns  bend  so  inwardly,  with  their  Tips %0atoward  the  Head,  that  they  are  of  no  Service  for  Fight,  and %0atherefore  he  hath  recourse  to  Flight  for  Safety  ;  and  in  it %0athrowing  out  his  Dung  at  intervals  to  the  Distance  of  three %0aAcres,  the  Contact  of  which  burneth  them  that  follow,  like  so %0amuch  Fire.

This  Africa  seeth  most, %0a%0a1  Sir  Charles  Bell,  "  Bridgewater  Treatise,"  p.  102,  says,  "  The  last %0abone,  which  supports  the  claw,  is  placed  laterally  to  the  next  to  the  last, %0aand  is  so  articulated  with  it  that  an  elastic  ligament  draws  it  back  and %0araises  the  sharp  extremity  of  the  claw  upwards.   In  the  ordinary  running %0aof  the  animal  the  nearer  extremity  of  the  furthest  bone  presses  the %0aground,  this  and  the  furthest  extremity  of  the  second  bone,  which  is  also %0abent  down,  being  received  on  a  pad,  which  acts  as  a  cushion,  and  also  adds %0ato  the  elasticity.   In  this  condition  the  claw  itself  is  received  into  a  sheath %0aabove ;  but  when  the  creature  strikes  an  object,  the  claws  are  brought  for- %0award, and  bent  under  by  the  action  of  the  flexor  tendons  acting  on  the %0alast  bone,  assisted  by  the  extensors,  which  cause  to  start  upward  the  end %0aof  the  second  bone  as  by  a  spring.    It  is  only  the  excitement  of  seizing  an %0aobject  that  can  produce  this  action ;  and  when  this  does  not  exist,  the %0abones  and  claw  fall  into  their  ordinary  almost  dislocated  condition." — %0aWern.

Olivier,  "  Voyage  dans %0a1'Kmpire  Othomau,  1'Egypt,  et  la  Perse,"  tom.iv.  says  that  the  lion  which %0ainhabits  the  part  of  Arabia  and  Persia  near  the  river  of  the  Arabs,  from %0ailie  Persian  Gulf  to  the  environs  of  Helle  and  of  Bagdad,  is  probably  the %0aspecies  of  lion  of  which  Aristotle  and  Pliny  have  spoken,  and  which  they %0aregarded  as  a  different  species  from  that  which  is  spread  over  the  interior %0aof  Africa.     This  lion  much  resembles  the  African  species,  excepting  that %0ait  is  smaller  and  has  no  mane.      la  1833  Captain  Since  exhibited  to  a %0ameeting  of  the  Zoological  Society  of  London  the  skins  of  a  lion  and  lioness %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  23 %0a%0awhere  for  want  of  Water  the  Wild  Beasts  meet  in  Troops %0aabout  the  few  Rivers  that  are  found.

From  hence  also  proceeds %0athe  common  Greek  Proverb,  That  Africa  is  continually %0abringing  forth  something  new.1  The  Lion  knoweth  by  Scent %0aof  the  Panther  when  the  Lioness  hath  suffered  his  Embrace  ; %0aand  with  all  his  might  he  punisheth  her  Adultery.  And %0atherefore  she  either  washeth  away  the  Crime  in  a  River, %0aor  else  folio weth  the  Lion  at  a  great  Distance.

He  stated  that  this  variety  was  distinguished %0afrom  those  previously  known  by  the  absence  of  a  mane  (that  is,  it  is %0amaneless  compared  with  other  lions),  from  the  sides  of  the  neck  and %0ashoulders,  the  middle  line  of  the  back  of  the  neck  being  alone  furnished %0awith  long  hairs,  which  are  erect,  like  those  of  the  same  situation  in  the %0aCheetah  (Felis  jubatd).  The  under  surface  of  the  neck  has  long  loose %0asilky  hairs,  and  there  is  a  tuft  at  the  angle  of  the  anterior  legs.  Besides1 %0athe  absence  of  the  extensive  mane,  the  tail  is  shorter  than  that  of  ordinary %0alions,  and  is  furnished  at  its  tip  with  a  much  larger  brush  or  tuft.

Thus, %0aaccording  to  Pliny's  theory,  the  Camelopardalis,  or  Giraffe  was  the  off- %0aspring of  the  Camel  and  Panther ;  the  Leopard,  of  the  latter  animal  and %0athe  Lion ;  and  the  Harte-beest  (Antelope  bubalus)  of  the  Antelope  and %0aBuffalo.  But  modern  experience  has  shewn  the  fallacy  of  this  opinion  ; %0aand  we  now  know  that  if  a  hybrid  be  sometimes  produced,  there  the %0apower  of  propagation  ceases.  There  is  no  proof  or  probability  that  any %0apermanent  race  has  risen  into  existence  since  first  individual  creation  pro- %0aceeded from  the  hand  of  its  Maker ;  and  in  a  wild  condition  it  is  ques- %0ationable whether  even  a  mongrel  individual  has  been  ever  produced, %0aalthough  this  has  sometimes  happened  in  captivity. —  Wern.

This %0aprickle  was  by  many  long  looked  upon  as  a  mere  fiction,  till  the  matter %0awas  put  beyond  a  doubt,  some  years  since,  by  Professor  Blumenbach, %0awho  upon  dissection  discovered  on  the  very  tip  of  the  tail  of  a  lioness  a %0asmall  dark-coloured  spine,  as  hard  as  a  piece  of  horn,  and  surrounded  at %0aits  base  with  an  annular  fold  of  skin.  It  is,  however,  only  occasionally %0afound ;  nor  is  it  confined  to  the  lion,  for  it  has  been  discovered  in  the %0aAsiatic  leopard.  Mr.  Wood  ("  Zool.  Proc."  1832)  remarks  that  it  is  dif- %0aficult to  conjecture  the  use  of  these  prickles,  their  application  as  a  stimulus %0ato  anger  being  of  course  out  of  the  question  ;  but  he  observes  that  it  could %0anot  be  very  important,  for,  to  say  nothing  of  their  small  size  and  envelope- %0ament  in  the  fur,  the  majority  of  individuals,  in  consequence  of  the  readi- %0aness with  which  the  part  is  detached,  are  deprived  of  it  for  the  remainder %0aof  their  lives.  The  writer  of  this  note  has  had  an  opportunity  of  seeing %0aand  feeling  the  prickle  in  the  tail  of  a  lion's  cub,  which  was  whelped  in %0aWomb  well's  menagerie.  —  Wern.

In  the  Beginning  of  his  Anger  he  beateth %0athe  Ground,  when  it  increaseth  he  beateth  his  Sides  and %0aBack  as  if  to  whip  himself  with  something  that  would  stir %0aup  his  Fury.  His  main  Strength  lieth  in  his  Breast ;  from %0aevery  Wound,  whether  made  by  his  Claw  or  Tooth,  the %0aBlood  that  floweth  is  Black.  When  their  Belly  is  full  they %0abecome  harmless.  His  Magnanimity  is  chiefly  shewn  in %0aDangers ;  not  only  in  that  he  despiseth  the  Darts,  but  also %0athat  he  defendeth  himself  by  his  Terror  only,  and  as  if  bear- %0aing witness  that  he  is  forced  to  his  own  Defence,  he  riseth  up %0ain  Fury,  not  as  at  last  compelled  by  the  Peril,  but  as  made %0aangry  by  their  Folly.  But  this  more  noble  Display  of  Courage %0ais  shewn  in  that,  however  great  may  be  the  Strength  of %0aHounds  and  Hunters,  while  in  the  open  Plains  and  where %0ahe  may  be  seen,  he  retireth  only  by  degrees  and  with  Scorn  ; %0abut  when  he  hath  got  among  the  Thickets  and  Woods  then %0ahe  hurrieth  away,  as  if  the  Place  concealed  his  Shame. %0aWhen  he  followeth  he  leapeth  with  a  Bound,  which  he  never %0auseth  to  do  in  Flight.  If  wounded  he  hath  a  remarkable %0aQuickness  of  Observation  to  discern  the  Person  who  smote %0ahim,  and  amidst  a  Multitude  he  runneth  upon  him  only.  As %0afor  the  Man  who  hath  thrown  a  Dart  at  him  without  wound- %0aing him,  he  striketh  him  down,  and  seizeth  and  shaketh  him, %0abut  doth  not  wound  him.  When  the  Female  fighteth  for  her %0aWhelps,  it  is  said  that  she  fixeth  her  Gaze  upon  the  Ground, %0athat  she  may  not  be  affrighted  at  the  Sight  of  the  hunting %0aWeapons.  For  the  rest,  they  are  destitute  of  Craft  and  Sus- %0apicion ;  they  never  look  aslant,  and  they  love  not  to  be %0alooked  at  in  that  manner.  It  is  believed  that  when  they  are %0adying  they  bite  the  Earth,  and  in  their  Death  shed  Tears. %0aThis  Animal,  so  fierce  as  he  is,  is  made  afraid  with  the %0arunning  round  of  Cart-wheels,  or  empty  Chariots;  he  is  ter- %0arified with  the  Cock's  Comb,  and  much  more  with  his  Crow- %0aing, but  most  of  all  with  the  Sight  of  Fire.

Q.  Sccevola,  the  Son  of  Publius, %0awas  the  first  at  Rome  that,  in  his  Curule  .ZEdileship,  exhibited %0aa  Fight  of  many  Lions  together;  but  L.  Sylla,  who  after- %0awards was  Dictator,  was  the  first  of  all  that  in  his  Praetor- %0aship  exhibited  an  hundred  maned  Lions.  After  him  Pompey %0athe  Great  shewed  600  of  them  in  the  Circus,  and  among %0athem  were  315  with  Manes.  Ccesar>  the  Dictator,  exhibited %0a400.  The  taking  of  them  formerly  was  a  hard  piece  of %0aWork,  and  was  commonly  in  Pit-falls ;  but  in  the  Reign  of %0aClaudius  a  Shepherd  of  Gsetulia  taught  the  manner  of  catch- %0aing them,  a  thing  to  be  regarded  as  almost  unbeseeming  the %0aName  of  such  a  Beast.  This  Gaetulian,  when  a  Lion  violently %0aassailed  him,  threw  his  Military  Cloak  over  his  Eyes.  This %0aremarkable  thing  was  soon  after  practised  in  the  Arena ;  so %0athat  a  Man  would  hardly  have  believed  that  so  much  Fierce- %0aness should  so  easily  be  rendered  inert  by  this  slight  covering %0athrown  on  the  Head,  the  Creature  making  no  resistance,  but %0asuffering  himself  to  be  bound  fast,  as  if  all  his  Vigour  rested %0ain  his  Eyes.  The  less  therefore  is  it  to  be  wondered  at  that %0aLysimachus  strangled  a  Lion,1  when  by  Command  of  Alex- %0aander he  was  shut  up  alone  together  with  him.  The  first %0awho  subdued  them  to  the  Yoke  at  Rome,  and  joined  them  to %0ahis  Chariot,  was  M.  Antony.  And  truly  it  was  in  the  Civil %0aWar,  when  the  Battle  was  still  in  Contest  in  the  Plains  of %0aPharsalia :  not  without  some  foretoken  of  the  times,  which %0aby  that  Prodigy  gave  them  to  understand  that  Men  of  a %0ahigh  Spirit  should  come  under  the  Yoke  of  Subjection ;  for %0athat  Antony  was  carried  in  this  manner,  with  the  Comic %0a%0a1  Plutarch,  in  the  "  Life  of  Demetrius,"  informs  us  that  "  Demetrius %0ahaving  sent  ambassadors  to  Lysimachus  on  some  occasion  or  other,  that %0aprince  amused  himself  one  day  with  shewing  them  the  deep  wounds  he %0ahad  received  from  a  lion's  claws  in  his  arms  and  thighs,  and  gave  them  an %0aaccount  of  his  being  shut  up  with  that  wild  beast  by  Alexander  the %0aGreat,  and  of  the  battle  he  had  with  it."  Pausanias,  Seneca,  and  Justin, %0amention  this  story  ;  but  Q.  Curtius  doubts  the  truth  of  it.—Wern.

It  is  reported  that  Hanno, %0aone  of  the  noblest  of  the  Carthaginians,  was  the  first  Man %0athat  ventured  to  manage  a  Lion  with  his  Hand,  and  to  shew %0ahim  as  being  rendered  Submissive.  But  he  was  condemned %0aon  account  of  this  very  Circumstance,  for  it  appeared  to  them %0athat  a  Man  of  such  artful  Ingenuity  would  be  able  to  per- %0asuade to  anything ;  and  that  it  was  dangerous  to  trust  their %0aLiberty  to  him,  to  whom  even  Fierceness  itself  had  so  re- %0amarkably yielded.  But  there  are  also  casual  Examples  of %0atheir  Clemency.  Mentor,  the  Syracusan,  met  with  a  Lion %0ain  Syria,  which  after  an  humble  manner  rolled  himself  in %0athe  Way  before  him  ;  and  being  astonished  with  Fear,  when %0ahe  sought  to  escape  in  every  way  the  Wild  Beast  placed  him- %0aself across  his  Path,  and  licked  his  Footsteps  in  a  flattering %0amanner.  Mentor  then  observed  that  the  Lion  had  a  Swelling %0aand  Wound  in  his  Foot,  whereupon  he  gently  plucked  out %0athe  Splinters  of  Wood,  and  so  eased  the  Beast  of  his  Pain.1 %0aThis  Fact  is  for  a  Memorial  represented  in  a  Picture  at  Syra- %0acuse. In  a  similar  Manner  Elpis,  a  Samian  by  Nation,  being %0aconveyed  to  Africa  in  a  Ship,  and  having  discovered  near  the %0aShore  a  Lion  having  a  threatening  Gape,  he  fled  quickly  to  a %0aTree,  and  called  upon  Father  Liber;  for  then  is  the  principal %0aTime  for  Prayer,  when  we  see  no  other  Hope.  But  the  Lion %0astopped  him  not  in  his  Flight,  although  it  was  in  his  Power; %0aand  laying  himself  down  close  to  the  Tree,  with  that  open %0aMouth  with  which  he  had  terrified  the  Man,  he  sought  his %0aCompassion.  Now  the  Beast  having  lately  fed  greedily,  had %0agotten  a  Bone  stuck  fast  within  his  Teeth,  which  put  him  to %0agreat  Pain ;  also,  he  was  almost  famished  ;  and  he  looked %0aup  pitifully,  shewing  how  he  was  punished  with  those  very %0aWeapons  of  his,  and,  as  if  with  dumb  Prayers,  besought  his %0aHelp.  Eipis,  on  the  other  Hand,  not  being  very  forward  to %0acommit  himself  to  the  Wild  Beast,  stayed  the  longer,  while %0ahe  considered  rather  this  miraculous  Accident  than  other- %0a%0a1  The  reader  will  here  be  reminded  of  the  well-known  story  of  An- %0adrocles,  or  Androdus,  and  the  lion,  told  by  Aulus  Gellius  and  JElian. — %0aWern.

At  the  last  he  came  down  from  the %0aTree  and  plucked  out  the  Bone,  while  the  Lion  held  his %0aMouth  open,  and  composed  himself  to  his  Conveniency  :  in %0arecompense  of  which  Service,  it  is  said,  that  so  long  as  this %0aShip  lay  on  that  Coast,  the  Lion  furnished  him  with  a  good %0aQuantity  of  Food  by  Hunting.  And  on  this  account  Elpis %0adedicated  a  Temple  in  Samos  to  Liber  Pater;  which  from %0athis  Circumstance  the  Greeks  called  jt.s^v6rog  A/ovutfou  (of %0aGaping  Dionysius}.'1  Can  we  feel  surprised  after  this,  that %0aWild  Beasts  should  know  the  Footsteps  of  Men,2  when  even %0athey  have  recourse  to  him  alone  for  Hope  of  Succour?  And %0awhy  did  they  not  go  to  other  Creatures?  or  who  taught %0athem  that  the  Hand  of  Man  was  ahle  to  cure  them  ?  unless %0athis  be  the  Reason,  that  perhaps  the  Power  of  many  Evils %0aforceth  even  savage  Beasts  to  seek  out  all  means  of  Help. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVII. %0aOf  Panthers. %0a%0aDEMETRIUS  the  Natural  Philosopher  also  maketh %0amention  of  as  memorable  a  Case  as  the  former,  concerning  a %0aPanther;  which  was  desirous  to  meet  with  a  Man,  and %0atherefore  lay  in  the  Middle  of  an  Highway,  and  suddenly %0aappeared  to  the  Father  of  a  certain  Philinus,  a  Student  of %0aPhilosophy.  The  Man,  through  Fear,  began  to  go  back %0aagain,  but  the  Wild  Beast  kept  rolling  itself  about  him,  very %0aplainly  fawning  upon  him,  and  tossing  itself  so  piteously, %0a%0a%0a1  Holland  has  chosen  to  add,  "  or  ^ar^os  vuov  AIOVVO-OV,  the  Chapel  of %0aDionysius  the  Saviour  ;"  not  because  there  are  such  words  in  the  text, %0abut  because  Gesner,  whose  edition  of  Pliny  he  appears  to  have  used,  not %0aunderstanding  the  purport  of  Pliny's  words,  has  proposed  to  substitute %0athe  latter,  which  he  supposed  to  be  a  more  intelligible  reading.

She  had  but %0alately  produced  Young,  and  her  Whelps  were  fallen  into  a %0aPit  at  a  Distance  off.  The  first  Point  of  Pity  that  the  Man %0ashewed  was  not  to  be  afraid ;  and  the  next,  to  direct  his %0aRegard  to  her ;  and  so  following  her  in  the  Way  whither  she %0adrew  him  by  his  Garment,  which  she  gently  held  with  her %0aClaws,  as  he  understood  the  Occasion  of  her  Sorrow,  and  the %0aReward  of  his  Courtesy,  he  drew  forth  her  little  ones  ;  which %0adone,  she  and  her  Whelps,  leaping  for  Joy,  accompanied  him, %0aand  directed  him  all  the  Way  to  beyond  the  Wilderness. %0aSo  that  it  easily  could  be  discerned  that  she  was  thankful %0ato  him,  and  that  they  mutually  acknowledged  each  other: %0aa  rare  Example  to  be  found  even  amongst  Men.  This  Story %0agives  great  Credit  to  that  which  Democritus  reporteth :  That %0aThoas,  in  Arcadia,  was  preserved  by  a  Dragon.  This  Thoas, %0awhen  a  Child,  had  loved  this  Dragon  exceedingly  well,  and %0anourished  him ;  but  being  in  some  dread  of  the  Serpent's %0aNature,  and  fearing  his  Magnitude,  he  had  carried  him  into %0athe  Deserts ;  wherein  being  environed  by  the  Stratagems  of %0aThieves,  when  he  cried  out,  the  Dragon,  knowing  his  voice, %0acame  forth  and  rescued  him.

Panthers  and  Tigers  are  almost  the  only  Beasts %0aseen  with  a  Variety  of  Spots ;  for  other  Beasts  have  each  one %0aa  proper  Colour  of  their  own,  according  to  their  Kind.

It  is  said  that  all  Quadrupeds  are  wonderfully  enticed %0aby  the  Smell  of  Panthers ;  but  their  Sternness  of  Counte- %0anance carrieth  Terror  with  it,  and  therefore  they  hide  their %0aHeads,  and  when  they  have  attracted  other  Beasts  within %0areach  by  their  sweet  Smell,  they  fly  upon  and  seize  them. %0aSome  report  that  they  have  a  Mark  on  their  Shoulder  resem- %0abling the  Moon,  growing  to  the  full  and  decreasing  into %0aHorns  as  she  doth.

"  Its  touch  was  also  said  to  cause  the %0aflesh  to  fall  from  the  bones  of  the  animal  with  which  it  came  in  contact. %0aThe  Basilisk  was  a  wingless  dragon,  and  derived  its  name  from  bearing  on %0aits  head  the  figure  of  a  crown.  The  Egyptians  believed  it  was  produced %0afrom  the  egg  of  the  ibis,  and  some,  more  modern,  from  the  egg  of  the %0acommon  cock  ;  and,  strange  as  it  may  appear,  the  latter  supposition  may %0aexplain  much  of  the  superstition  regarding  it.  It  is  now  known  that, %0afrom  some  change  in  the  structure  and  action  of  the  ovary,  a  hen  some- %0atimes assumes  the  plumage  of  a  cock ;  as  is  the  case  also  with  other  galli- %0anaceous fowls,  and  even  the  duck.  The  final  result  is  barrenness ;  but %0aprevious  to  this  an  egg  may  be  produced,  that  is  unnatural  in  its  size  and %0acontents ;  and  such  a  one  is  figured  by  Aldrovandus,  and  copied  from %0ahim  by  Ruysch  (Table  of  Serpents,  X.).  Such  an  egg  resembles  the %0aproduce  of  some  serpents,  and  the  latter  might  be  easily  mistaken  for  the %0aformer.  The  egg  of  a  snake  may  be  often  found  on  a  dung-heap,  over %0awhich  a  fowl  may  roost ;  and  an  individual  who  had  seen  an  egg  from %0asuch  a  transformed  fowl,  might  mistake  a  snake's  egg  for  it,  and  watch  it %0ato  its  hatching.  Hens  also  sometimes  lay  soft  eggs  (without  a  shell),  and %0awhen  they  do  so,  as  wanting  the  firmness  natural  to  it,  the  egg  escapes %0afrom  them  when  on  the  perch,  without  the  consciousness  of  laying.  The %0aEditor  has  known  such  eggs  to  fall  on  the  dungheap  below ;  and  when %0aso,  it  would  not  be  easy  to  distinguish  them  from  those  laid  by  snakes  in %0athe  same  place.  An  egg  so  laid  produces  nothing  living ;  but  the  uncer- %0atainty attending  it,  especially  if  laid  by  a  hen  in  a  condition  of  trans- %0aformed plumage,  in  the  same  place  with  those  deposited  by  a  snake,  would %0abe  a  sufficient  foundation  for  all  the  superstition  attending  it.  The  eggs %0aof  the  Basilisk,  and  their  liability  to  be  mistaken  for  those  which  were %0awholesome,  are  referred  to  by  the  prophet  Isaiah,  lix.  5.

Fabius  addeth  one  thing %0amore,  that  he  findeth  again  the  same  Garment.  It  is  won- %0aderful to  what  extent  Grecian  Credulity  can  proceed  ;  so  that %0athere  is  not  so  impudent  a  Lie  but  it  findeth  some  one  to %0abear  Witness  to  it.  And  therefore  Agriopas,  who  wrote  the %0aOlympionicse,  telleth  of  one  Dcemcenetus  Parrhasius,  who  at  a %0aSacrifice  of  a  Human  Being,  which  the  Arcadians  celebrated %0ato  Jupiter  Lyccens,  tasted  of  the  Inwards  of  a  Boy,  and  was %0aturned  into  a  Wolf;  and  the  same  Man  ten  Years  after  was %0achanged  to  a  Man  again,  became  a  Wrestler,  contended  in %0aBoxing,  and  went  away  home  again  with  Victory  from %0aOlympia.  Besides,  it  is  commonly  believed  that  in  the %0aTail  of  this  Animal  there  is  a  little  Hair  that  is  effectual  to %0aprocure  Love  ;  and  that  when  he  is  taken  he  casteth  it  away, %0abecause  it  is  of  no  Force  unless  it  is  taken  from  him  while %0ahe  is  Alive.  He  goeth  to  rut  in  the  whole  Year  no  more %0athan  twelve  Days.  When  he  is  very  hungry  he  devoureth %0aEarth.  Among  Auguries,  if  a  Wolf,  in  going  about,  turn  to %0atheir  Right  Hand,  with  the  Interruption  of  his  Journey,  it  is %0agood ;  but  if  his  Mouth  be  full  when  he  doth  so,  there  is %0anot  a  better  Sign  in  the  World.  There  are  some  of  this %0aKind  that  are  called  Stag- Wolves,1  such  as  we  have  said %0athat  Pompey  shewed  in  the  Circus,  brought  out  of  Gallia. %0aThis  Animal,  they  say,  however  hungry  he  may  be  when %0ahe  is  eating,  if  he  chance  to  look  backward,  forgetteth  his %0aMeat,  and  wandereth  away  to  seek  for  some  other  Prey. %0a%0a1  Lib.  viii.  c,  19.—  Wern.

[BOOK  VIII. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIII. %0aOf  Serpents. %0a%0aAs  regards  Serpents,  it  is  commonly  observed  that  for %0athe  most  part  they  are  of  the  Colour  of  the  Earth  in  which %0athey  lie  hidden  :  and  a  very  great  number  of  Sorts  there %0aare  of  them.  The  Cerastes1  hath  standing  out  on  the %0aBody  some  small  Horns,  which  are  often  four  Double ; %0aby  moving  which,  while  the  rest  of  the  Body  is  hidden, %0ashe  enticeth  the  Birds  into  her  Power. %0a%0aThe  Amphisbsena  hath  two  Heads,2  that  is  to  say,  one  at %0athe  Head  and  another  at  the  Tail,  as  if  it  were  little  to  cast %0aout  her  Poison  at  one  Mouth  only.  Some  have  Scales, %0aothers  are  painted ;  but  all  have  deadly  Venom.  The %0aJaculus  darteth  itself  from  the  Boughs  of  Trees :  so  that %0awe  are  not  only  to  guard  against  Serpents  with  our  Feet, %0abut  also  to  look  to  them  that  fly  as  a  Dart  from  an  Engine. %0aThe  Aspides  swell  about  the  Neck3  (when  they  purpose  to %0asting);  and  there  is  no  Remedy  for  the  Bite  unless  the %0aParts  that  are  wounded  are  cut  off  immediately.  This %0adestructive  Creature  hath  one  Point  yet  of  Understanding, %0a%0a1  Vipera  (Cerastes")  caudalis. — SMITH.  Near  the  middle  of  each  of %0athe  arched  eyebrows  of  this  venomous  snake  there  is  a  slender,  pointed, %0aslightly  recurved  spine,  about  a  line,  or  a  line  and  a  quarter  in  length. %0aThis  in  part  answering  the  description  of  Pliny,  renders  it  not  improbable %0athat  it  is  the  reptile  intended  by  our  author.  It  inhabits  the  dry  sandy %0adistricts  of  Africa.  A  harmless  serpent  much  like  this  is  mentioned  by %0aHerodotus,  book  ii.  as  being  esteemed  sacred  by  the  Egyptians. —  Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a3  The  modern  genus  Amphisbsena  is  perfectly  harmless  and  inoffen- %0asive, and  confined  to  Brazil  and  other  parts  of  South  America ;  it  could %0anot,  therefore,  have  been  known  to  the  ancients.

From  various  circumstances, %0ahowever,  and  particularly  from  the  description  of  Pliny,  it  is  evident  that %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  45 %0a%0aor  rather  of  Affection  :  they  for  the  most  part  wander  abroad %0ain  Pairs ;  nor  can  they  live  without  their  Mate :  so  that  if %0aone  be  killed,  it  is  incredible  how  the  other  seeketh  to  be %0arevenged.  It  pursueth  the  Murderer;  it  knoweth  him %0aagain  amongst  a  great  number  of  People,  and  followeth  him %0aclosely ;  it  overcometh  all  Difficulties,  goeth  to  any  Dis- %0atance, and  nothing  will  save  him  unless  it  is  stopped  by  some %0aRiver,  or  that  the  Individual  betake  himself  to  a  hasty %0aFlight.  I  am  not  able  to  say  whether  Nature  hath  been %0amore  free  in  producing  such  Evils,  or  in  giving  us  Remedies. %0aFor,  in  the  first  place,  she  hath  afforded  to  this  hurtful %0aCreature  but  a  dim  Pair  of  Eyes,  and  those  not  placed  in  the %0afore  Part  of  the  Head,  to  see  directly  forward,  but  in  the %0aTemples.

This  Animal  alone,  of  all  other  that  live  on  the %0aLand,  hath  no  use  of  a  Tongue.  He  only  moveth  the %0aupper  Jaw,  with  which  he  biteth  hard  ;  and  the  grasp  of %0ahis  Mouth  is  otherwise  terrible,  by  means  of  the  row  of  his %0aTeeth,  which  close  within  one  another  as  if  two  Combs %0apenetrated  each  other.  Ordinarily  he  is  above  eighteen %0aCubits  in  Length.  The  Female  layeth  Eggs  as  big  as  those %0aof  a  Goose,  and  sitteth  continually  upon  them  out  of  the %0aWater.  By  a  certain  Fore-knowledge  she  is  aware  how  far %0athe  Nile  will  rise  that  Year  when  it  is  at  the  highest.  There %0ais  no  other  Creature  that  from  a  smaller  Beginning  groweth %0ato  a  greater  Size.  He  is  armed  with  Claws,  and  his  Skin %0awill  resist  any  Injury  whatever.  By  Day  it  keepeth  on  the %0aLand,  but  passeth  the  Night  in  the  Water  ;  being  guided  by %0aeach  according  to  the  Season.  When  it  hath  satisfied  its %0aAppetite  with  Fishes,  it  lieth  asleep  on  the  Shore,  and %0aalways  with  some  of  the  Meat  in  his  Mouth.  Then  cometh %0aa  little  Bird,  called  there  Trochilos,2  and  in  Italy  the  King  of %0aBirds,  and  for  the  sake  of  her  Food  she  instigates  the  Crea- %0ature to  gape  by  hopping  first  about  its  Mouth,  which  she %0apecks  and  cleanses,  and  then  the  Teeth,  after  which  she %0agetteth  within  to  the  Back  of  his  Mouth,  which  it  openeth %0athe  wider  because  it  taketh  such  great  Delight  in  this %0ascouring.

All %0abirds  and  animals  in  general  avoid  him ;  the  trochilus  is  the  only  animal %0aat  peace  with  him  ;  and  that  on  account  of  the  services  he  receives  from %0athat  bird ;  for  when  the  crocodile  comes  out  of  the  water  to  land,  and %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%0athis  Pleasure,  the  Ichneumon,  having  discovered  the  Oppor- %0atunity, shooteth  himself  down  his  Throat  like  a  Dart,  and %0agnaweth  a  Hole  through  his  Belly.1 %0a%0aIn  the  Nilus  there  breeds  also  the  Scincos,2  which  is  like %0athe  Crocodile,  but  less  than  the  Ichneumon.  It  is  the  chief %0aAntidote  against  Poisons,  and  also  provokes  the  Heat  of %0aLust  in  Men. %0a%0aBut  the  Crocodile  produceth  so  much  Mischief,  that %0aNature  is  not  content  to  have  given  him  only  one  Enemy; %0a%0aopens  his  mouth,  the  trochilus  goes  into  his  throat  and  devours  the %0aleeches :  the  crocodile  is  pleased  at  being  relieved,  and  hurts  not  the %0atrochilus."  Although  this  statement  is  confirmed  by  Aristotle,  Pliny, %0aand  other  ancient  writers,  it  has  been  very  generally  discredited  in %0amodern  times.  Recent  inquiries,  however,  shew  that  in  this,  as  in  most %0aof  his  relations,  the  father  of  history  is  justified  by  the  fact.  The  term %0a"bdella"  has  hitherto  been  translated  "  leech."  But  M.  Geoffrey  St. %0aHilaire  has  adopted  the  opinion  that  it  corresponds  to  "culex,"  that  is, %0a"  a  gnat,"  myriads  of  which  insects  swarm  on  the  banks  of  the  Nile,  and %0aattack  the  crocodile  when  he  comes  to  repose  on  the  sand.  His  mouth %0ais  not  so  hermetically  closed  but  that  they  can  enter,  which  they  do  in %0asuch  numbers,  that  the  interior  of  his  palate,  which  is  naturally  of  a %0abright  yellow,  appears  covered  with  a  darkish  brown  crust.  The  insects %0astrike  their  trunks  into  the  orifices  of  the  glands  which  abound  in  the %0amouth  of  the  crocodile ;  and  the  tongue  of  the  animal  being  immoveable, %0ait  cannot  get  rid  of  them.  It  is  then  that  the  trochilus,  a  kind  of  plover, %0aclosely  allied  to  the  Charadrius  minor  of  Meyer,  or  in  the  opinion  of  M. %0aSt.  Hilaire,  C.  Egyptiacus,  but  which  Pliny,  confounding  with  another %0abird  of  the  same  name,  calls  "  the  king  of  birds,"  in  its  pursuit  of  the %0agnats,  hastens  to  his  relief ;  the  crocodile  always  taking  care,  when  he  is %0aabout  to  shut  his  mouth,  to  make  certain  movements  which  warn  the %0abird  to  fly  away.  Thus  the  ancient  story  is  not  so  unreasonable  as  might %0abe  thought.  It  is  matter  of  every-day  observation,  that  gnats  will  attack %0abulls  and  other  large  terrestrial  animals  of  the  fiercest  nature ;  and  that %0awagtails  and  other  insectivorous  birds  will  peck  the  former  from  their %0amuzzles.  While  in  India  it  is  common  to  see  the  ox  approaching  its  eye %0adeliberately  to  the  ground,  by  holding  its  head  on  one  side,  to  enable  the %0amina,  a  species  of  starling,  to  take  an  insect  from  the  hairs  of  the  eyelid. %0aThere  appears,  therefore,  no  reason  why  the  crocodile  should  not  have %0arecourse  to  similar  aid  on  similar  necessity. —  Wern.

For  all  Creatures %0aare  herein  very  skilful,  and  know  not  only  their  own %0aAdvantages,  but  also  what  may  hurt  their  Enemies.

The  Skin  of  the  Crocodile's  Belly  is  thin  and %0asoft;  and  therefore  the  Dolphins,1  as  if  afraid  of  them,  dive %0aunder  Water,  and  getting  beneath  until  they  have  gotten %0aunder  his  Vent,  rip  it  up  with  this  sharp  Spine.  Also, %0athere  is  a  Kind  of  People  that  bear  a  Hatred  to  the  Croco- %0adile, and  they  are  called  Tentyrites,  from  an  Island  of  the %0aNile  which  they  inhabit.  These  Men  are  of  small  Stature, %0abut  when  opposed  against  the  Crocodiles,  and  then  only,  it  is %0awonderful  to  see  how  resolute  they  are.  Indeed  this  Cro- %0acodile is  a  terrible  Beast  to  them  who  fly  from  him  ;  but  on %0athe  other  Hand  he  runneth  away  from  such  as  pursue  him. %0aNow,  these  People  are  the  only  Men  that  dare  to  approach %0aright  in  front  of  him.

A  ride  on  the  back  of  a  crocodile  does  not  seem  a  very  tempting %0athing ;  but  that  it  has  long  been  occasionally  performed  in  the  process  of %0akilling  these  monsters  is  shewn  by  Dr.  Pocock,  in  his  "  Observations  on %0aEgypt,"  where  he  says,  "  They  make  some  animal  cry  at  a  distance  from %0athe  river,  and  when  the  crocodile  comes  out  they  thrust  a  spear  into  his %0abody,  to  which  a  rope  is  tied :  they  then  let  him  go  into  the  water  to %0aspend  himself,  and  afterwards  drawing  him  out,  run  a  pole  into  his %0amouth,  and,  jumping  on  his  back,  tie  his  jaws  together."—  (Vol.  i.  p.  203.) %0aMr.  Waterton,  in  his  "Wanderings  in  South  America,"  tells  us  he  per- %0aformed  the  same  extraordinary  feat.      His  Indian  assistants  having %0asecured  a  monster  of  the  Essequibo,  by  a  baited  hook  fastened  to  a  long %0apole,  "they  pulled  the  cayman,"  as  he  describes  (p.  231,)  "within  two %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%0alike  Horsemen ;  and  as  they  turn  up  their  Heads,  with  their %0aMouth  wide  open  to  bite,  they  thrust  a  Club  into  it  across, %0aand  so  holding  with  the  Hands  each  End  of  it,  the  one  with %0athe  right  and  the  other  with  the  left  as  with  a  Bridle, %0athey  bring  them  Prisoners  to  land ;  and  then,  when  they %0ahave  them  there,  they  so  frighten  them  with  their  Voice %0aonly,  that  they  compel  them  to  vomit  up  those  Bodies  which %0athey  have  newly  swallowed,  and  bury  them.  And  therefore %0athis  is  the  only  Island  which  the  Crocodiles  will  not  swim %0ato ;  for  the  very  Smell  of  these  Tentyrites  drives  them %0aaway,  just  as  the  Psylli1  do  with  Serpents.

The  Tail  and  hooked  Teeth  are  like  those %0aof  Boars,  but  less  formidable ;  the  Skin  of  his  Back  impene- %0a%0ayards  of  me ;  I  saw  he  was  in  a  state  of  fear  and  perturbation  ;  I  instantly %0adropped  the  mast,  sprang  up,  and  jumped  on  his  back,  turning  half  round %0aas  I  vaulted,  so  that  I  gained  my  seat  with  my  face  in  a  right  position.

M.  Varro %0awriteth,  That  there  was  a  Town  in  Spain  undermined  by %0aRabbits ;  and  one  in  Thessaly,  by  the  Moles.  In  Gallia,  the %0aInhabitants  of  one  City  were  driven  out  by  Frogs.  In  Africa, %0athe  People  were  expelled  by  Locusts.  Out  of  Gyaros,1  an %0aIsland  of  the  Cyclades,  the  Inhabitants  were  driven  away  by %0aRats  and  Mice.  In  Italy,  Amyclae  was  destroyed  by  Ser- %0apents.

Also  that  he  will  imitate %0athe  Vomiting  of  a  Man,  to  entice  the  Dogs  to  come  to  him, %0aand  then  devour  them.  This  Beast  alone  will  dig  up  the %0aGraves  in  search  of  Bodies.  The  Female  is  seldom  taken. %0aThere  are  a  thousand  Variations  in  their  Eyes,  through  the %0achange  of  Colour.  Moreover,  if  a  Dog  come  within  his %0aShadow,  he  becometh  dumb.  Again,  by  certain  magical %0aArts,  if  he  go  round  about  any  other  living  Creature  three %0aTimes,  it  shall  not  have  the  Power  to  stir  a  Foot.  The %0aLioness  of  Ethiopia,  by  Copulation  with  this  kind,  brings %0aforth  the  Leocrocuta  j1  which  likewise  knoweth  how  to  imi- %0atate the  Voice  both  of  Man  and  the  Sheep.  His  Sharpness %0aof  Sight  is  constant ;  he  hath  one  continuous  Tooth  (in %0aeither  Jaw),  and  no  Gums.  That  these  Bones  may  not  be- %0acome blunt  by  continual  rubbing  against  one  another,  they %0aare  enclosed  as  if  within  a  Sheath. %0a%0aJuba  reporteth  that  the  Mantichora2  in  Ethiopia  imi- %0atateth  Men's  Language.  Many  Hyaenas  are  produced  in %0aAfrica;  which  also  yieldeth  a  Multitude  of  wild  Asses.3 %0aAnd  one  of  the  Males  ruleth  whole  Flocks  of  the  female %0aAsses.  These  Beasts  are  so  jealous,  that  they  look  narrowly %0ato  the  Females  great  with  young;  and  as  soon  as  they  have %0afoaled,  they  castrate  the  young  Males.  On  the  other  Hand, %0athe  she-Asses,  when  they  are  with  young,  seek  hiding- %0aplaces,  from  a  Desire  to  bring  forth  secretly;  and  they  delight %0ain  the  Abundance  of  their  Gratification. %0a%0aThe  Beavers  in  Pontus  4  do  the  same  as  the  male  Asses, %0aby  the  same  Parts,  when  Danger  presses ;  as  knowing  that %0athey  are  sought  after  for  this ;  and  these  Parts  Physicians %0acall  Castoreum.

It  is  said  that  they  lay %0aaside  these  Medicines,  reserving  only  to  themselves  the  Poi- %0ason ;  and  when  they  have  taken  their  Food,  they  resume %0athe  same  again.  The  Sea-Calf3  likewise  feedeth  both  in  the %0aSea  and  upon  the  Land  ;  and  hath  the  same  Habits  with  the %0aBeaver.  He  vomiteth  up  his  Gall,  which  is  good  for  many %0aMedicines ;  and  so  he  doth  his  Runnet,  which  is  a  Remedy %0afor  the  Epilepsy :  for  he  is  well  aware,  that  Men  seek  after %0ahim  for  these  two  Things.  Theophrastus  writeth,  that  the  Stel- %0aliones4 cast  off  their  old  Coat  as  Snakes  do  ;  but  they  imme- %0adiately eat  it  up  again,  and  so  prevent  Men  from  obtaining %0athe  Remedies  for  the  Epilepsy.

They  are  got  with  Young  after  the  rising  of  the  Star %0aArcturus  ;  they  go  eight  Months,  and  sometimes  produce %0atwo  Calves  at  once.  Finding  themselves  with  Young,  they %0apart  Company  with  the  Stags.  But  the  Males,  seeing  them- %0aselves left,  fall  into  the  Rage  of  Heat,  and  dig  Pits  in  the %0aGround.  Then  their  Muzzles  become  black,  and  so  con- %0atinue, until  such  Time  as  the  Rain  washeth  away  the  Colour. %0aThe  Hinds,  before  they  calve,  purge  themselves  with  the %0aHerb  called  Seselis,1  whereby  they  have  more  easy  Deliver- %0aance. After  Parturition  they  have  two  Herbs,  which  are  called %0aArus2  and  Seselis,  after  having  eaten  of  which  they  return %0ato  their  Young,  being  willing,  for  some  unknown  Reason, %0athat  their  first  Milk  should  taste  of  these  Herbs.  They  exer- %0acise their  new-born  little  ones  in  the  Race,  and  teach  them %0ato  know  how  to  fly  away.  They  lead  them  to  high  and %0acraggy  Rocks,  and  show  them  how  to  leap.  And  now  the %0aStags  being  past  the  Heat  of  Rut,  fall  eagerly  to  their  Food. %0aWhen  they  find  themselves  to  be  grown  very  Fat,  they  seek %0aLurking-places,  confessing  how  incommodious  their  Weight %0ais  to  them.  At  other  Times  always  they  delight  in  flight ;  and %0astand  still  to  look  behind.  But  when  the  Hunters  are  come %0anear  them,  then  they  seek  the  Shelter  of  Flight  again ;  and %0athis  they  do  for  a  Pain  in  their  Bowels,  which  Parts  are  so %0atender,  that  with  a  slight  Blow  they  will  burst  within.

So  long  as  they  are  destitute  of %0aHorns  they  go  out  to  seek  Food  by  Night ;  the  Horns  grow %0ahard  by  the  increasing  Heat  of  the  Sun  ;  and  then  they %0aoccasionally  try  them  against  Trees  ;  and  when  they  are %0asatisfied  that  they  are  strong,  they  go  abroad  boldly.

This  great  Commander,  a  Man  of  high  Mind, %0aoffended  at  the  Laziness  of  so  great  a  Body,  commanded %0athat  he  should  be  killed.  News  of  this  went  presently  to  the %0aKing ;  and  therefore  he  sent  a  second  Dog,  with  this  Mes- %0asage :  That  he  should  not  make  trial  of  this  too  against %0asmall  Beasts,  but  set  him  against  a  Lion  or  an  Elephant : %0aadding,  that  he  had  no  more  than  those  two  ;  and  if  this %0awere  killed  likewise,  it  was  not  likely  he  would  have  more  of %0athat  Race.

As  this  expedient  was  new  to  the %0atraveller,  he  made  some  further  inquiries,  and  was  assured,  that  if  any %0aperson  in  such  a  predicament  will  simply  seat  himself  on  the  ground,  lay- %0aing aside  his  weapons  of  defence,  the  dogs  will  also  squat  in  a  circle  round %0ahim ;  that  as  long  as  he  remains  quiet,  they  will  follow  his  example ;  but %0aas  soon  as  he  rises,  and  moves  forward,  they  will  renew  the  assault." — %0aWern.

Dogs  bear  Young  once  in  a  Year ;  and  the %0adue  Time  for  them  to  be  with  Whelps  is  when  they  are  a %0aYear  old.  They  go  with  Young  threescore  Days.  Their %0aPuppies  come  blind  into  the  World ;  and  the  more  Milk %0athey  suck,  the  later  it  is  before  they  receive  their  Sight :  but %0ait  is  never  above  twenty  Days  before  they  see,  and  they  do %0anot  open  their  Eyes  under  seven  Days  old.  Some  say  that  if %0abut  one  be  born  at  a  Litter,  it  will  see  in  nine  Days ;  if  two, %0ait  will  be  in  ten  Days ;  and  the  more  Puppies  she  hath,  the %0amore  Days  it  will  be  in  that  Proportion  before  they  see : %0aalso,  that  the  Bitch-whelp  which  cometh  of  the  first  Litter %0adiscerns  Fairies.1  The  best  of  the  whole  Litter  is  that  Whelp %0awhich  is  last  to  begin  to  see ;  or  that  which  the  Bitch  car- %0arieth  first  into  her  Kennel.  The  Madness  of  Dogs  is  most %0adangerous  to  a  Man,  as  we  have  said  before,  while  Syrius  is %0aburning  hot ;  for  they  that  are  so  bitten  have  a  deadly  Fear %0aof  Water.  To  prevent  this,  therefore,  it  is  good  for  thirty %0aDays  to  mingle  Hen's  Dung  with  the  Meat  of  the  Dogs ;  or, %0aif  the  Disease  be  coming  on,  Hellebore. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLI. %0aAgainst  the  Bite  of  a  mad  Dog. %0a%0aTHE  sovereign  Remedy  against  this  Bite  was  revealed %0alately  by  a  certain  Oracle  :2  being  the  Root  of  a  wild  Rose, %0a%0a1  The  Fauni  here  mentioned,  and  again  Lib.  xxv.  4,  and  which  we %0ahave  translated  by  the  modern  term  "  Fairies,"  were  a  species  of  Incubi, %0asupposed  to  occasion  the  nightmare  and  other  similar  diseases. — Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a3  Lib.  xxv.  2. %0a%0a%0a74  History  of  Nature.

I %0a%0aTHE  same  Alexander  of  whom  we  have  spoken,  had  a %0avery  uncommon  Horse,  which  they  called  Bucephalus  ;  either %0afrom  his  stern  Look,  or  from  the  Mark  of  a  Bull's  Head  im- %0aprinted on  his  Shoulder.  It  is  reported  of  Alexander,  that %0abeing  but  a'  Boy,  he  was  so  much  attracted  by  his  handsome %0aAppearance,  that  he  bought  him  out  of  the  Flock  of  Philo- %0anicus  the  Pharsalian,  at  the  Price  of  sixteen  Talents.  He %0awould  suffer  no  Man  to  sit  on  his  Back  but  Alexander,  when %0ahe  had  the  royal  Saddle  and  Furniture  on ;  rejecting  others %0aentirely.  The  same  Horse  was  of  memorable  service  in %0aBattles,  and  being  wounded  at  the  Assault  of  Thebes  he %0awould  not  suffer  Alexander  to  alight  and  mount  upon  ano- %0ather. Many  other  Things  of  the  same  kind  he  did  ;  on  Ac- %0acount of  which,  when  he  was  dead,  the  King  conducted  his %0aFuneral  sumptuously  ;  erected  a  Tomb  for  him,  and  about  it %0abuilt  a  City  that  bore  his  Name.  C&sar  the  Dictator  like- %0awise had  a  Horse  which  would  not  suffer  any  Man  to  ride %0ahim  but  his  Master ;  and  the  same  Horse  had  his  Forefeet %0aresembling  those  of  a  Man  ;  and  its  Statue  so  formed  is %0aplaced  before  the  Temple  of  Venus  Genetrix.

There  was %0aanother  Horse,  that  when  the  Covering  was  removed  from %0ahis  Eyes,  and  he  knew  that  he  had  served  as  a  Stallion  to  his %0aown  Dam,  rushed  to  a  Precipice,  and  threw  himself  down %0aand  died.  We  find,  also,  that  in  the  Territory  of  Reate,  an %0aHorsekeeper  was  torn  upon  the  same  Occasion  of  a  Mare. %0aFor  surely  these  Animals  understand  their  Relationship ; %0aand  therefore  Colts  will  in  the  Flock  more  willingly  keep %0aCompany  with  their  Sisters  of  the  former  Year,  than  with %0athe  Mare  their  Mother.  Horses  are  so  docile,  that  we %0afind  in  the  Army  of  the  Sybaritani,  the  whole  Troop  of  Horse- %0amen had  their  Horses  accustomed  to  be  moved  to  a  certain %0aDance  at  the  Sound  of  Music.  They  have  an  Anticipation %0aof  a  Battle,  and  mourn  the  Loss  of  their  Masters;  some- %0atimes also,  they  shed  tears  for  Love  of  them.  When  King %0aNicomedes  was  slain,  his  Horse  starved  itself  to  Death. %0aPhilarchus  reporteth,  that  King  Antiochus  having  in  Battle %0aslain  Centaretus,  a  Galatian,  became  possessed  of  his  Horse, %0aand  mounted  him  in  a  triumphant  manner ;  but  the  Horse, %0aseized  with  Indignation,  would  not  be  restrained  by  the %0aBridle,  but  ran  furiously  to  a  Precipice,  and  threw  itself %0adown  ;  where  both  Horse  and  Man  perished  together.  Phi- %0alistus  writeth,  that  when  Dionysius  left  his  Horse  stickng %0afast  in  the  Mire  that  he  might  save  himself,  the  Animal %0afollowed  the  Tracks  of  his  Master,  with  a  Swarm  of  Bees %0asettling  in  his  Mane ;  which  was  the  first  Presage  that  in- %0aduced Dionysius  to  usurp  the  Tyranny.  The  variety  of  their %0aSkill  cannot  be  expressed ;  and  those  who  throw  Darts %0ahave  Proof  of  their  entire  Obedience,  in  urging  them  to  the %0amost  difficult  Attempts  with  great  Dexterity  and  striving  of %0athe  Body.  They  even  gather  up  Darts  from  the  Ground, %0aand  reach  them  to  the  Horseman  ;  and  when  they  are  fast- %0aened to  the  Chariots  in  the  Circus  they  display  beyond  a %0adoubt  their  Consciousness  of  Encouragement  and  Glory.

A %0agreater  Augury  happened  in  old  Time,  when  in  the  Plebeian %0aCircensian  Games,  the  Driver  was  thrown  out  of  the  Cha- %0ariot, and  yet  the  Horses  ran  directly  into  the  Capitol,  as  if %0ahe  had  stood  still  in  his  Place  ;  and  there  they  ran  three  times %0around  the  Temple.  But  the  greatest  of  all  was,  that  the %0aHorses  of  Ratumenas  came  thither  from  Veij,  with  the %0aPalm  and  Crown  which  they  had  won  there,  after  they  had %0athrown  out  their  Master,  who  had  conquered  in  the  Games %0aat  that  City;  from  whom  the  Gate  (Ratumena)1  took  its %0aName.  The  Sarmatians,  when  they  intend  to  take  a  great %0aJourney,  prepare  their  Horses  two  Days  before,  by  giving %0athem  no  Meat,  and  only  allow  them  a  little  Drink ;  and  thus %0athey  will  ride  them  an  hundred  and  fifty  Miles  at  one  Stretch. %0aSome  Horses  live  fifty  Years,  but  Mares  not  so  long.  In  five %0aYears  the  latter  come  to  their  full  Growth,  but  Horses  grow %0aone  Year  longer.  The  Beauty  of  Horses,  such  as  a  Man %0awould  choose  for  the  best,  hath  been  very  elegantly  and  com- %0apletely described  by  the  Poet  Virgil.'1  And  we  also  have %0aspoken  of  the  same  Thing  in  a  Book  lately  put  forth,  con- %0acerning Dart-throwing  on  Horseback  ;  and  about  what  is %0a%0a1  Plutarch's  account  of  this  circumstance,  which  he  gives  in  the  Life  of %0aPublicola,  is  as  follows  :  — -  "  It  happened  that  there  was  a  chariot  race  at %0aVeii,  which  was  observed  as  usual ;  except  that,  as  the  charioteer,  who  had %0awon  the  prize  and  received  the  crown  was  gently  driving  out  of  the  ring,  the %0ahorses  took  fright  from  no  visible  cause ;  but,  either  by  some  direction  of %0athe  gods,  or  turn  of  fortune,  ran  away  with  their  driver,  at  full  speed  to- %0awards Rome.  It  was  in  vain  that  he  pulled  the  reins,  or  soothed  them %0awith  words ;  he  was  obliged  to  give  way  to  the  career,  and  was  whirled %0aalong  till  they  came  to  the  Capitol,  where  they  flung  him,  at  the  gate  now %0acalled  Ratumena." — LANGHORNE'S  Translation.  —  Wern.

But  for  Horses %0atrained  to  the  Circus,  a  different  mode  of  Proceeding  is  to  be %0asought  for.  For  whereas  they  may  be  broke  into  other  Em- %0aployments when  they  are  two  Years  old,  they  must  not  be %0abrought  to  enter  into  that  Contest  before  they  are  five  Years %0aof  Age.  The  Females  in  this  kind  go  eleven  Months  with %0aYoung,  and  in  the  twelfth  they  Foal.  The  Sexes  are  put %0atogether  at  the  Spring  Equinox,  when  both  of  them  are  two %0aYears  old  ;  but  if  they  be  kept  until  they  are  three  Years  of %0aAge,  they  produce  stronger  Colts.  The  Male  is  fertile  to %0athree-and-thirty  Years  old ;  so  that  when  they  are  dismissed %0afrom  the  Circus,  after  their  twentieth  Year,  they  are  sent  to %0aproduce  Offspring.  And  it  is  said  that  they  will  continue  to %0aforty  Years  with  a  little  Help  put  to  the  Forepart  of  the %0aBody,  to  lift  him  up.  Few  Beasts  besides  are  less  capable %0aof  Fertility  than  the  Male ;  for  which  Cause  they  are  allowed %0asome  Space  between,  and  in  one  Year  the  most  that  can  be %0aallowed  is  fifteen.  The  Way  to  quench  the  Heat  of  a  Mare  is %0ato  shear  her  Mane.  Arid  yet  Mares  can  bear  every  Year  until %0athey  come  to  forty  Years.  It  is  reported  that  an  Horse  hath %0alived  three-score  and  fifteen  Years.  Mares  only  among  all %0aRaces  produce  their  Foals  standing  on  their  Feet;  and  they %0alove  them  more  than  any  other  Creatures  do  their  Young. %0aFoals  truly  have  on  their  Forehead  a  black  Thing  of  the %0aBigness  of  a  Fig,  called  Hippomanes,1  which  is  a  powerful %0aCharm  to  procure  Love ;  and  this  the  Dam  devours  as  soon %0aas  the  Colt  is  born ;  and  if  it  chance  that  any  Person  hath %0amanaged  to  secure  it  before  her,  she  will  not  permit  the  Foal %0ato  suck  her.

The  hotter  sto- %0amached an  Horse  is,  the  deeper  he  thrusteth  his  Nose  into %0athe  Water  as  he  drinketh.  The  Scythians  chose  rather  to  use %0atheir  Mares  in  War,  because  their  staling  is  no  Hindrance  to %0atheir  Running.  It  is  an  admitted  Fact  that  in  Lusitania,  along %0athe  River  Tagus,  and  about  the  City  Olyssipo  (Lisbon)  when %0athe  West  Wind  bloweth,1  the  Mares  set  themselves  full  against %0ait,  and  so  conceive  that  genital  Air  from  which  they  become %0apregnant,  and  bring  forth  Foals  of  exceeding  Swiftness  ;  but %0athey  live  not  above  three  Years.  In  the  same  Spain,  from %0athe  Parts  called  Gallaica  (Gallicia)  and  Asturica  (Asturia) %0athere  is  produced  a  Race  of  Horses  which  we  call  Thieldones; %0aand  others  of  less  Stature,  named  Asturcones.  These  Horses %0ahave  a  pleasant  Pace  peculiar  to  themselves ;  with  one  Foot %0aset  down  before  another  softly  and  roundly  in  order  by %0aturns ;  from  which  our  Horse-breakers  have  obtained  the  Art %0aby  Cords  to  bring  an  Horse  to  the  like  Amble.

Neither  do  they  go  with  Young,  like  other  Cattle, %0ain  the  Spring  Equinox,  but  at  the  Solstice.  He-Asses  are %0athe  worse  for  being  spared  in  their  Work.  The  Females %0ahave  bred  early,  at  the  Age  of  thirty  Months  ;  but  three %0aYears  is  the  due  Time  :  as  often  as  Mares,  and  just  so %0amany  Months,  and  after  the  same  Manner.  But  after %0aReception  they  must  be  forced  to  run  by  beating  them,  or %0aelse  they  will  let  go  their  Seed.  They  seldom  produce  two %0aat  once.  The  Ass,  when  about  to  Foal,  avoideth  the  Light, %0abut  seeketh  some  dark  Place,  that  she  may  not  be  seen  by %0aMan.  She  breeds  all  her  Life-time,  which  is  to  her  thirty %0aYears.  They  love  their  young  Foals  exceedingly  well:  but  they %0acannot  abide  Water.  To  their  little  ones  they  will  go  through %0aFire ;  but  if  there  be  the  least  Brook  between,  they  are  so %0aafraid,  that  they  dare  not  dip  their  Feet  therein.  They  will %0anot  drink,  except  of  their  accustomed  Fountains,  within  their %0aFeeding-ground ;  and  in  such  a  Manner  that  they  may  go %0aalong  a  dry  Path  to  their  Drink :  neither  will  they  go  over  any %0aBridges  where  the  Planks  are  not  so  close  together  as  that %0athey  see  the  Water  through.  Strange  to  say,  they  are  thirsty; %0abut  if  their  Water  be  changed,  they  must  be  forced  to  drink, %0aor  else  unloaded  of  their  Burdens.  They  love  to  lie  at  large, %0aand  have  Room  enough.  For  in  their  Sleep  they  dream  of %0avarious  Fancies  appearing  to  them  ;  and  so  they  fling  about %0athem  with  their  Heels  in  every  Direction ;  by  which,  if  they %0ashould  beat  against  some  hard  Thing,  they  would  soon  be %0alame.  They  are  more  profitable  to  their  Masters  than  the %0aRevenues  of  good  Farms.  It  is  well  known,  that  in  Celti- %0aberia  she-Asses,  by  breeding,  have  produced  the  Value  of %0a400,000  Sesterces.  For  the  foaling  of  Mules,  they  affirm  that %0athe  principal  Thing  to  be  regarded  in  the  Ass  is  the  Hair %0aof  the  Ears  and  the  Eyelids.  For  however  the  whole  Body %0abesides  be  of  one  Colour,  yet  shall  the  Mules  foaled  have %0aas  many  Colours  as  were  in  those  Parts.

For  breeding  such  Mules  they  choose  Mares  that %0aare  not  under  four  Years  old,  nor  above  ten.  They  relate %0athat  they  will  drive  away  one  another  in  both  kinds,  unless %0athey  sucked  the  Milk  of  the  Dam,  when  they  were  young,  of %0athat  kind  by  which  they  would  produce.  And  for  this  Pur- %0apose they  remove  away  either  the  young  Ass-Foals,  and  set %0athem  in  the  dark  to  the  Teats  of  the  Mare,  or  else  the  young %0aColts  to  suck  of  the  she- Ass.  For  there  is  a  Mule  also  that %0acometh  of  a  Horse  and  a  female  Ass :  but  they  are  unruly, %0aand  of  unconquerable  Slowness  :  and  much  more  if  they  be %0afar  in  Age.  If,  when  a  she- Ass  hath  conceived  by  an  Horse, %0ashe  admit  an  Ass,  an  Abortion  follows ;  but  it  is  not  so  if %0aan  Horse  follow  an  Ass.  It  is  observed,  that  seven  Days %0aafter  an  Ass  hath  foaled  is  the  best  Time  for  another  Con- %0aception; and,  also,  that  the  he- Asses  succeed  best  when %0aweary  with  Travel.  That  Ass  is  understood  to  be  barren %0awhich  hath  not  conceived  before  she  hath  cast  her  Foal's- %0ateeth ;  and  also  she  which  doth  not  conceive  at  the  first.  In %0aold  Time  they  used  to  call  those  Hinuli,  which  were  begotten %0abetween  an  Horse  and  an  Ass  :  and,  on  the  other  Hand, %0aMules,  such  as  were  between  an  Ass  and  a  Mare.  Also %0ait  is  observed,  that  a  Creature  born  from  Beasts  of  two %0adifferent  kinds,  formeth  a  third  Sort,  resembling  neither  of %0athe  Parents  ;  and  that  such  as  are  produced  in  this  Manner, %0awhatever  kind  of  Creatures  they  are,  are  themselves  barren  ; %0aand  therefore  she -Mules  never  breed.  We  find  in  our %0aChronicles,  that  oftentimes  Mules  have  brought  forth,  but %0ait  was  always  taken  for  a  Prodigy.

Mules  are  broken  of  their %0aKicking  if  they  are  often  made  to  drink  wine.  It  is  found %0awritten  in  what  remains  of  many  Greeks,  that  there  has %0abeen  produced  between  an  he-Mule  and  a  Mare,  a  Creature %0awhich  the  Latins  call  Hinnus,  that  is,  a  little  Mule.  Between %0aMares  and  wild  Asses  that  have  been  made  tame  are  pro- %0aduced a  kind  of  Mules,  very  swift  in  running  and  exceed- %0aingly hard-hoofed,  slender  of  body,  of  unconquered  but %0agenerous  spirit.  But  the  Mule  that  cometh  of  a  wild  Ass %0aand  a  female  tame  Ass  exceeds  all  the  rest.  Wild  Asses %0a(Onagri)  are  the  best  in  Phrygia  and  Lycaonia.  Africa %0aboasts  of  the  Flesh  of  their  Foals,  which  is  excellent  Meat  ;x %0aand  such  they  call  Lalisiones.  It  appeareth  in  the  Chronicles %0aof  Athens,  that  a  Mule  lived  eighty  Years;  and  that  when %0athey  built  the  Temple  in  the  Citadel  at  that  Place,  this  old %0aMule  being  set  aside  for  Age,  would  yet  accompany  the %0aother  labouring  Beasts,  and  if  any  of  them  were  ready  to  fall %0aunder  their  Load,  would  relieve  and  encourage  them  accord- %0aing to  his  power:  by  which  the  people  were  so  much  pleased, %0athat  they  made  a  Decree  that  the  Corn-Merchants  should %0atake  good  Care  that  this  Mule  should  not  be  driven  away %0afrom  their  Cleansing-Sieves. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLV. %0a%0aOf  Oxen* %0aIT  is  said  that  the  Oxen  of  India  are  as  high  as  Camels, %0a%0ao  * %0a%0aand  four  Feet  broad  between  the  Horns.     In  our  Part  of  the %0a%0a1  ^Elian,  Hunting,  book  iii.     The  Persians  and  Tartars  hold  the  flesh %0aof  the  wild  ass  in  high  esteem,  and  hunt  it  in  preference  to  all  other %0adescriptions  of  game.     Olearius  assures  us  that  he  saw  no  fewer  than %0athirty-two  wild  asses  slain  in  one  day  by  the  Schah  of  Persia  and  his %0acourt,  and  their  bodies  were  sent  to  the  royal  kitchens  at  Ispahan.

Therefore  they  were  of  great  Size; %0aand  so  they  continue  in  their  Posterity  to  this  Day.  In  the %0apresent  Day,  however,  they  are  permitted  to  breed  when %0a/hey  are  one  Year  old,  or  at  most  two;  which  is  more  tole- %0arable. Bulls  are  generative  when  they  are  four  Years  old ; %0aand  one  is  a  sufficient  Companion  for  ten  Cows  through  the %0aYear.  If  a  Bull,  after  Copulation,  go  away  toward  the  right %0aHand,  he  hath  gotten  a  male  Calf;  hut  if  to  the  left,  a  Cow %0aCalf.  Cows  are  fertile  at  the  first ;  but  if  it  chance  that %0athey  fail,  the  twentieth  Day  after  they  again  seek  their  Fel- %0alow. In  the  tenth  Month  they  calve ;  and  whatever  cometh %0abefore  that  Term  is  worth  nothing.  Some  write  that  they %0acalve  just  upon  the  last  Day  of  the  tenth  Month  complete. %0aThey  seldom  bring  forth  two  Calves  at  a  Time.  Their  Time %0aof  Propagation  continueth  thirty  Days  from  the  rising  of  the %0aDolphin  to  the  Day  before  the  Nones  of  January  ;  but  some %0apropagate  in  Autumn.  Indeed,  in  those  Countries  where  the %0aPeople  live  on  Milk,  they  order  the  Matter  so,  that  they  are %0anot  without  this  Food  all  the  Year  long.  Bulls  do  not  serve %0aabove  two  Cows  in  one  Day.  Oxen  alone  of  all  Animals  go %0abackward  as  they  feed  ;  and  among  the  Garamantsb  they %0a•scarcely  ever  feed  otherwise.  Cows  live  riot  above  fifteen %0aYears  at  the  most ;  but  the  Males  come  to  twenty.  They  are %0ain  their  full  Strength  when  five  Years  old.  It  is  said  they  will %0agrow  fat  if  they  are  bathed  with  hot  Water  ;  or  if  a  Man  slit %0atheir  Hide,  and  with  a  Reed  blow  Wind  into  their  Entrails. %0aOxen  are  not  to  be  despised  as  defective,  although  they  may %0alook  but  ill-fa vouredly  ;  for  in  the  Alps  those  that,  are  least %0aof  Body  are  the  best  for  Milk.  And  the  best  labouring %0aOxen  are  they  which  are  yoked  by  the  Head,  and  not  the %0aNeck.  In  Syria  they  have  no  Dewlaps,  but  a  Bunch  stand- %0aing on  the  Back.  They  of  Caria  also,  a  Country  in  Asia, %0aare  ill-favoured  to  be  seen,  having  between  their  Necks  and %0aShoulders  a  projecting  Tumour ;  and  their  Horns  are  loose, %0aas  if  out  of  Joint;  and  yet  by  Report,  tbev  are  excellent  for %0a%0a%0aBOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  83 %0a%0aLabour:  but  the  black  or  white  in  this  kind  are  condemned %0afor  Work.  Bulls  have  less  and  slenderer  Horns  than  Cows %0aor  Oxen.  The  Time  to  bring  the  Ox  or  Bull  to  the  Yoke  is %0aat  three  Years  of  Age  ;  after  this  it  is  too  late,  and  before  it %0ais  too  soon.  A  young  Steer  is  soonest  trained  to  draw,  if  he %0abe  coupled  with  another  that  hath  been  taught  already ;  for %0athis  Animal  is  our  Companion  in  Labour  and  the  Cultivation %0aof  the  Ground  :  and  so  highly  regarded  was  the  Ox  by  our %0aForefathers,  that  we  find  it  on  Record  that  a  Man  was  judi- %0acially condemned  on  a  given  Day  by  the  People  of  Rome, %0abecause,  to  gratify  a  wanton  Concubine  of  his,  who  said  he %0ahad  not  eaten  any  Tripe  all  the  while  he  was  in  the  Country, %0ahe  had  killed  an  Ox,1  although  it  was  his  own  ;  and  for  this %0aFact  he  was  banished,  as  if  he  had  slain  his  own  Manager  of %0aHusbandry.  There  is  a  Majesty  in  the  Aspect  of  a  Bull ; %0atheir  Countenance  stern,  their  Ears  covered  with  stiff  Hairs, %0aand  their  Horns  standing  as  if  they  were  ever  demanding  to %0afight.  But  all  his  threatening  appears  in  his  Fore-feet ;  be- %0astirring himself  now  with  one  Foot,  and  then  with  another, %0aas  his  Anger  bursts  forth,  flinging  the  Sand  aloft  into  the  Air: %0aand  of  all  other  Beasts  he  alone  with  such  an  Incitement %0astirs  up  his  Anger.  We  have  seen  them  fight  one  another %0afor  the  Mastery ;  and  thus  viewed  to  be  swung  round,  in %0atheir  Fall  to  be  caught  up  by  the  Horns,  and  to  rise  again  : %0awhen  only  lying  along,  to  be  raised  from  the  Ground  ; %0aand  when  they  have  run  with  a  rapid  Pace,  in  two-wheeled %0aChariots,  they  have  stood  still  suddenly,  as  if  the  Cha- %0arioteers had  caused  them  to  stop.  It  was  an  Invention  of %0athe  Thessalians,  with  a  Horse  to  gallop  close  to  the  Bull's %0aHorns,  and  kill  it  by  twisting  its  Neck.  The  first  that  exhi- %0abited this  Show  to  the  People  of  Rome,  was  Cce.sar  the %0aDictator.  The  Bull  forms  the  most  worthy  and  sumptuous %0aOffering  of  Reconciliation  to  the  Gods.

Among  the  Prodigies  that %0awe  read  of  in  ancient  Times,  we  find  that  an  Ox  hath  spoke  ; l %0aand  when  this  was  announced,  the  Senate  was  accustomed  to %0abe  held  in  an  open  Place. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVI. %0aOf  the  Ox  Apis. %0a%0aIN  Egypt,  also,  an  Ox2  is  worshipped  as  a  God,  and  they %0acall  it  Apis.3  It  was  marked  with  a  white  Spot  on  the  right %0aSide,  like  the  Horns  of  the  new  Moon  ;  a  Knob  under  the %0aTongue,  which  they  call  Cantharus:4  it  was  not  lawful  to %0a%0a1  When  a  report  was  brought  that  an  ox  had  spoken,  the  senate  was %0aheld  in  the  open  air.

This  was  against  the %0acustom,  because  under  ordinary  circumstances  the  senate  could  only  meet %0ain  stated  places — at  first  limited  to  two  within  the  city,  and  the  temple  of %0aBellona  without  it ;  afterwards  the  right  was  extended  to  several  temples %0aand  curiae  —  the  latter  being  consecrated  by  the  augurs,  but  not  to  any %0aparticular  deity.

Until  they  find  him  they  mourn  and %0ashave  their  Heads.  But  they  never  are  long  before  they %0ameet  with  another  :  and  when  they  have  found  him,  he  is  by %0athe  Priests  brought  to  Memphis,  where  he  hath  two  Shrines %0a(Delubra),  which  they  call  Thalami  (Bed-chambers),  which %0aare  the  Auguries  of  the  People.  For  if  this  Ox  enter  into %0aone  of  them,  it  is  a  good  Sign  ;  but  if  into  the  other,  it  por- %0atendeth  Misfortune.

He  is  kept  secret  for  the  most  Part : %0abut  when  he  hath  got  forth  to  the  Multitude,  he  proceeds %0awith  a  Guard  of  Lictors,  and  a  Flock  of  Boys  accompany %0ahim,  singing  a  Hymn  to  his  Honour  :  for  he  seemeth  to %0aunderstand,  and  is  pleased  to  be  worshipped.  These  Com- %0apanies presently  become  beside  themselves,  and  foretell %0afuture  Things.  Once  a  Year  there  is  presented  to  him  a %0aCow,  which  hath  Marks  as  he  hath,  but  differing  from  his  ; %0aand  it  is  said  that  always  upon  what  Day  this  Cow  is  found, %0aon  the  same  it  dieth.

They %0aare  fertile  from  two  Years  of  Age  upward  to  nine,  and  some %0auntil  they  are  ten  Years  old.  The  first  Lambs  are  smaller %0athan  the  others.  They  go  with  Young  about  the  Setting  of %0aArcturus,  that  is,  from  the  third  Day  before  the  Ides  of  May %0ato  the  Setting  of  the  Eagle,  on  the  tenth  Day  before  the %0aCalends  of  August.  They  are  with  Young  150  Days.  If %0aany  are  conceived  after  that  Time  they  prove  weak.  Lambs %0aborn  after  that  Season  they  called  in  old  Time  Cordos  (later %0aLambs).  Many  prefer  these  Winter  Lambs  before  those  that %0acome  in  Spring ;  because  it  is  much  better  they  should  be %0astrong  before  the  Solstice  than  before  the  shortest  Days :  and %0athey  think  that  this  Creature  only  is  useful  by  being  born  in %0athe  midst  of  Winter.  It  is  natural  for  Rams  to  loathe  young %0aLambs,  and  to  follow  after  old  Ewes.  Himself  also  is  better %0awhen  old,  and  more  effective  for  them.  To  make  them  more %0agentle,  they  bore  his  Horn  through  near  his  Ear.  If  his  right %0aTesticle  be  tied  up,  he  getteth  Ewe  Lambs  :  if  the  left,  Males. %0aIf  Ewes  be  by  themselves  when  it  thundereth,  they  cast  their %0aLambs.  The  Remedy  is  to  gather  them  together,  that  by %0aCompany  they  may  have  help.  They  say  that  if  the  North %0aWind  blow  they  will  conceive  Males  ;  but  if  the  Wind  be %0aSouth,  Females.  Moreover,  great  Regard  is  had  in  this %0aKind  to  the  Mouths  of  the  Rams :  for  of  what  Colour  the %0aVeins  be  under  their  Tongue,1  of  the  same  will  the  Fleece  be %0aof  the  Lambs;  and  they  will  be  of  a  Variety  of  Colours  if  the %0aVeins  were  so.  Also  the  Change  of  Water  arid  Drink  maketh %0athem  to  alter  their  Colour.

In  the  third  Rank %0astands  the  Milesian  Sheep.  The  Wool  of  Apulia  is  of  a  short %0aStaple,  and  is  of  Reputation  for  nothing  beside  Mantles. %0aAbout  Tarentum  and  Canusium  the  richest  of  this  Kind  are %0afound  :  as  also  at  Laodicea  in  Asia.  For  Whiteness  there  is %0anone  better  than  that  which  groweth  along  the  Po  ;  and  yet %0ato  this  Day  a  Pound  of  it  hath  not  exceeded  the  Price  of  an %0ahundred  Sesterces.  They  do  not  shear  Sheep  everywhere  ; %0afor  the  Custom  of  plucking  their  Fleece  cont'mueth  still  in %0asome  Places.  There  are  several  Sorts  of  Colours  in  Wool,  so %0athat  we  are  not  able  to  give  distinct  Names  to  all  that  we %0acall  Native.  Black  Fleeces1  are  chiefly  in  Spain;  Pollentia, %0anear  the  Alps,  has  grey  ;  Asia  is  distinguished  for  red,  and %0athese  Wools  are  called  Erythraese  :  in  Boeotia  the  same.  In %0aCanusia  the  Colour  is  yellow  :  and  at  Tarentum  they  are %0abrown.  All  Wool,  in  its  native  Grease,  is  used  in  Medicine.2 %0aAbout  Istria  and  Liburuia  the  Fleece  resembleth  Hair  rather %0athan  Wool,  and  is  not  good  to  make  Clothes  with  a  high  Nap ; %0abut  serveth  only  for  the  Workman  in  Portugal,  whose  Weav- %0aing in  Net- work  with  Squares  commendeth  this  Wool.  The  like %0aWool  is  common  about  Piscenae,  in  the  Province  Narbonensis %0a(Languedoc) ;  and  such  is  found  in  Egypt  :  the  Cloth  made %0aof  it,  after  it  is  worn  bare,  is  dyed,  and  again  will  wear %0aduring  a  Man's  Life.

Babylon  was  much  celebrated  for  the  weav- %0aing of  Cloth  of  various  Colours  into  a  Picture,  and  Cloths  so %0awrought  were  called  Babylonica.  To  weave  with  many %0atwisted  Threads  was  the  Invention  of  Alexandria,  and  these %0awere  named  Polymita ;  but  Gallia  invented  the  Method  of %0adividing  the  Work  into  Shields  or  Escutcheons.

They  go %0awith  Young  five  Months,  like  Ewes.  She-Goats  become %0abarren  with  Fatness.  When  three  Years  old  they  are  not  so %0agood  to  breed  ;  and  when  they  are  older,  not  beyond  four %0aYears  of  Age.  They  begin  at  the  seventh  Month,  even  while %0athey  snck  their  Dams.  Both  Sexes  are  more  useful  if  they %0ahave  no  Horns.  The  first  Time  in  the  Day  that  the  she- %0aGoats  go  with  the  Male  is  void :  the  second  is  more  fertile, %0aand  so  forward.  They  conceive  in  the  Month  of  November, %0aso  that  they  may  bring  Kids  in  March,  when  Shrubs  begin %0ato  bud ;  and  this  is  sometimes  when  they  are  a  Year  old,  but %0aalways  at  two  Years;  and  when  three,  they  are  not  utterly %0adecayed  :  for  they  are  fertile  for  eight  Years.  In  cold  Wea- %0ather they  are  liable  to  Abortion.  The  she-Goat,  when  her %0aEyes  are  overspread  with  Opacity,  pricketh  them  with  the %0aPoint  of  a  Rush,  and  so  letteth  them  bleed  :  but  the  Buck %0auseth  the  Brier  for  the  same  Purpose.

They  farrow  twice  a  Year; %0athey  go  with  Young  four  Months.  One  Sow  may  bring  at %0aa  Farrow  to  the  Number  of  twenty  Pigs  ;  but  she  cannot  rear %0aso  many.  Nugidius  saith,  that  those  Pigs  which  are  farrowed %0aon  the  ten  Days  about  the  shortest  Day  of  the  Year,  are %0aborn  with  Teeth.  They  are  fertile  at  one  coupling,  but  be- %0acause they  are  subject  to  Abortion  it  requires  to  be  repeated. %0aThe  Way  to  prevent  Abortion  is  to  keep  them  asunder  at %0atheir  first  seeking,  and  before  their  Ears  hang  down.  The %0aMales  are  not  fertile  after  three  Years  old.  Sows,  when  they %0aare  feeble  for  Age,  are  rendered  fertile  as  they  lie  along. %0aThat  a  Sow  should  eat  her  own  Pigs  is  not  a  Prodigy.  A %0ayoung  Pig  is  pure  for  Sacrifice  five  Days  after  it  is  farrowed ; %0aa  Lamb  at  eight  Days;  and  a  Calf  at  thirty  Days.  But %0aCoruncanus  denieth  that  Beasts  which  chew  the  Cud  are %0apure  for  Sacrifice  until  they  have  two  Teeth.  Swine  that %0ahave  lost  one  Eye  are  not  thought  to  live  long  after ;  other- %0awise they  may  continue  until  they  are  fifteen  Years  old,  and %0asome  to  twenty.  But  they  grow  outrageous,  and  subject  to %0amany  other  Kinds  of  Diseases,  especially  the  Quinsy  and %0aScrofula.

Of  all  other  Animals  they  are  the  most  brutish; %0aso  that  there  goeth  a  witty  saying  of  them,  That  their  Life  is %0agiven  them  instead  of  Salt.1  It  is  known  that  when  Thieves %0ahad  driven  away  a  Company  of  them,  on  hearing  the  Voice %0a'of  the  Swineherd  they  leaned  all  to  one  Side  of  the  Vessel, %0aand  sunk  it,  and  then  returned  to  their  Keeper.  Moreover, %0athe  Hogs  that  lead  the  Herd  are  so  well  trained,  that  they %0awill  of  themselves  go  to  the  Swine  Market-place,  and  from %0athence  Home  again ;  and  the  Wild  ones  have  the  Wit  to %0aconfound  the  Prints  of  their  Feet,  in  the  marshy  Ground, %0aand  to  render  their  Flight  more  easy  by  first  voiding  their %0aUrine.2  Sows  also  are  spayed  as  Camels  are ;  but  two  Days %0abefore,  they  are  kept  from  Meat :  then  they  hang  them  by %0athe  Forelegs  to  make  Incision  into  the  Part;  and  by  this %0ameans  they  grow  to  Fat  sooner.  There  is  an  Art  also  to %0aprepare  the  Liver  of  a  Sow,  as  also  of  a  Goose,3  which  was %0athe  Invention  of  M.  Apicius*  by  feeding  them  with  dry %0aFigs,  and  when  they  have  eaten  till  they  are  full,  presently %0ato  kill  them  with  a  Drink  of  Water,  Wine,  and  Honey %0a(Mulsus).5  There  is  not  the  Flesh  of  any  other  living  Crea- %0ature that  affordeth  more  Matter  for  Gluttony  :  for  there  are %0anearly  fifty  Sorts  of  Tastes,  whereas  others  have  but  one %0aeach.

To  these  belong  the  (Damae)  Does,6  and  Py- %0agargi;7  as  also  Strepsicerotes,8  and  many  others  much  like. %0a%0apassing  through  the  skin  of  the  snout,  and  curving  round  over  the %0aforehead,  so  as  to  protect  the  head  and  eyes,  render  it  applicable  to %0aPliny's  description  of  the  wild  boar  of  India.  —  Wern.

Mutianus  saith,  that  they %0ahave  played  at  Chess;  and  that  at  first  Sight  they  knew  Nuts %0amade  of  Wax  from  others ;  that  when  the  Moon  is  in  the %0awane  those  Kinds  which  have  Tails  are  sad,  but  the  new %0aMoon  they  adore  with  Skipping  for  Joy  :  for  the  Eclipse  of %0aSun  or  Moon  these  and  all  other  four-footed  Creatures %0agreatly  dread.  Monkeys  of  all  Sorts  are  very  fond  of  their %0aYoung  Ones ;  and  those  which  are  kept  tame  in  Houses  will %0adisplay  them  to  every  one  as  soon  as  they  are  born,  carrying %0athem  about :  they  also  take  Pleasure  to  have  them  dandled,  as %0aif  they  understood  it  to  imply  Congratulation,  and  in  this  Way %0athey  generally  end  in  killing  them  by  their  Embraces.  The %0aNature  of  the  Cynocephali2  is  the  most  savage ;  as  that  of  the %0aSphinges  and  Satyri  is  the  most  gentle.

Of  the  Hare  kind  are  they  also %0awhich  in  Spain  they  call  (Cuniculi2)  Rabbits,  which  are  ex- %0aceedingly fruitful ;  so  that  having  devoured  all  the  Corn  in %0athe  Field  before  Harvest  in  the  Balearic  Islands,  they %0abrought  thereby  a  Famine  on  the  People.  There  is  a  very %0adainty  Dish  at  Table  made  of  the  young,  either  cut  out  of %0athe  Dam's  Belly,  or  taken  from  them  when  they  are  suck- %0aing, without  cleansing  their  Entrails :  and  they  call  it  Lau- %0arices.  It  is  certain  that  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Balearic %0aIslands  made  a  Petition  to  Divus  Augustus  Ccesar  for  mili- %0atary Aid  to  destroy  the  great  Increase  of  these  Creatures %0aamong  them.  Ferrets3  are  a  favourite  Resource  for  hunt- %0aing them.  They  put  them  into  their  Holes,  which  within %0athe  Ground  have  many  Passages  (from  whence  these  Crea- %0atures are  called  Cuniculi} :  and  when  they  are  driven  out %0aof  their  Earth  they  are  soon  taken.

The  same  Writer  says,  that  every  Hare  is  in  posses- %0asion of  a  double  Faculty,  and  can  breed  without  the  Buck. %0aHerein  Nature  hath  showed  her  Bounty,  that  so  harmless  an %0aAnimal,  and  so  good  to  eat,  should  produce  so  abundantly. %0aThe  Hare  is  naturally  exposed  to  be  a  Prey  to  all ;  it  is  the %0aonly  Creature,  except  the  Dasypus,1  which  superfoetates  ;  so %0athat  she  hath  one  sucking  her ;  another  within  her,  covered %0awith  Hair ;  another  is  naked  ;  and  another  scarcely  well- %0ashaped  :  all  in  the  Womb  together.  An  Attempt  has  been %0amade  to  make  Cloth  of  Hare's  Fur ;  but  to  the  Touch  they %0aare  not  so  soft  as  upon  the  Skin ;  and  the  Hair  is  soon  shed, %0abecause  of  its  shortness. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVI. %0aOf  Beasts  half  tame. %0a%0aHARES  are  seldom  rendered  tame ;  and  yet  they  cannot %0arightly  be  called  wild.  For  many  other  Creatures  there  are %0athat  are  neither  wild  nor  gentle,  but  of  a  middle  Nature  be- %0atween both.  Such  is  among  Birds,  Swallows,  Bees;  and  in %0athe  Sea,  Dolphins. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVII. %0aOf  Mice*  and  Dormice. %0a%0aIN  the  Class  of  those  which  are  neither  tame  nor  wild, %0amany  have  arranged  the  Mice  that  haunt  our  Houses :  a %0aCreature  not  to  be  despised  in  considering  public  Prodigies. %0aBy  gnawing  the  silver  Shields3  at  Lavinium,  they  portended %0athe  Marsian  War.  To  Carlo  the  Imperator,  by  eating  the %0aBandages  which  he  used  in  fastening  his  Shoes,  at  Clusium, %0a%0a1  It  is  not  possible  to  determine  what  animal  Pliny  intended  by  the %0aterm  Dasypus:  some  have  supposed  the  word  to  be  no  more  than  an %0aepithet  for  a  species  of  Lepus,  all  of  which  are  soft-footed.

There  are  many  kinds  of %0athem  in  the  Country  of  Cyrerie :  some  with  a  broad  Fore- %0ahead, others  with  a  sharp-pointed  ;  and  some  with  sharp %0aBristles,  like  Hedgehogs.  Theophrastus  reporteth,  that  they %0adrove  away  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Island  Gyaros,  and %0agnawed  even  the  Iron  :  a  Thing  which  it  seems  their %0aNature  to  do ;  for  among  the  Chalybes  they  eat  the  Iron  in %0athe  Smiths'  Workshops ;  and,  indeed,  in  Gold  Mines1  on %0athis  Account  they  cut  open  their  Bowels,  and  so  they  always %0afind  their  stolen  Goods  again  :  such  Delight  this  Creature %0ataketh  in  thieving.  We  read  in  the  Chronicles,  that  when %0aAnnibal  besieged  Casilinum,  a  Mouse  (Murem)  was  sold %0afor  two  hundred  Sesterces ;  and  the  Man  who  bought  it %0alived,  but  he  that  sold  it  died  for  Hunger.  If  white  ones %0aabound,  it  presageth  Prosperity.  Our  Annals  are  full  of %0aInstances,  that  when  Rats  (Sorices)  are  heard  to  squeak %0athe  Auspices  are  broken  off.  Nigidius  saith,  that  Rats  also %0alie  hid  in  Winter,  like  Dormice2  (Glires).  By  the  Laws  of %0athe  Censors,  and  principally  by  an  Act  of  M.  Scaurus,  in  his %0aConsulship,  it  was  provided  that  these  should  be  kept  away %0afrom  Suppers  in  no  other  Manner  than  were  Shell-fish,  or %0aBirds  brought  from  foreign  Countries.  The  Dormouse  is  a %0ahalf-  wild  Creature  ;  and  he  who  first  contrived  to  keep %0aBoars  in  Parks,  also  fed  these  Animals  in  Tubs.  In  which %0aPractice  it  hath  been  observed,  that  these  little  Creatures %0awill  not  associate  unless  they  were  Inhabitants  of  the  same %0aWood ;  and  if  there  be  mingled  among  them  any  Strangers, %0asuch  as  had  some  River  or  Mountain  between  the  Places %0awhere  they  were  bred,  they  kill  one  another  with  fighting. %0a%0a1  Livy  tells  us,  Lib.  xxviii.  23,  that  at  Cumse  mice  gnawed  some  gold %0ain  the  temple  of  Jupiter ;  and  again,  Lib.  xxx.  2,  that  at  Antium  some %0amice  gnawed  a  golden  crown.  — Wern.

In  the  Forest  of %0aMoesia  in  Italy,  these  Dormice  are  found  only  in  one  Part. %0aIn  Lycia,  Roebucks1  never  pass  the  Mountains  that  border %0aon  the  Syrians ;  nor  do  the  wild  Asses  that  Mountain  which %0adivideth  Cappadocia  from  Cilicia.  Within  Hellespont  the %0aStags  never  wander  away  into  the  Borders  of  other  Coun- %0atries ;  and  those  which  are  about  Arginussa  do  not  pass  be- %0ayond the  Mountain  Elatus;  which  may  be  known  by  the %0aFact,  that  all  upon  that  Mountain  have  their  Ears  divided. %0aIn  the  Island  Poroselenum,  the  Weazels  do  not  cross  over %0athe  Highway.  And  about  Lebadia  in  Bceotia,  those  Moles %0awhich  are  brought  thither  from  other  Parts  fly  from  the %0avery  Soil ;  although  near  by,  in  Orchomenus,  they  under- %0amine all  the  Corn-fields  ;  and  I  have  seen  all  the  Bed- %0aclothing  made  of  their  Skins.  In  this  Manner,  even  Religion %0awill  not  prevent  our  seeking  Pleasures  out  of  the  Portents %0athemselves.  The  strange  Hares  that  are  brought  to  Ithaca %0aare  found  dead  about  the  very  Banks  of  the  Sea.  In  the %0aIsland  Ebusus  there  are  no  Rabbits ;  but  in  Spain  and  in  the %0aBalearic  Islands  they  abound.

Even  now %0ain  the  Island  Seriphos  they  are  silent ;  but  if  the  same  are %0acarried  to  other  Places,  they  sing.  And  they  say  that  the %0alike  happeneth  in  a  Lake  of  Thessaly  named  Sicendus.  In %0aItaly  the  Bite  of  the  Shrew-mouse1  (Mus  araneus)  is  venom- %0aous ;  but  beyond  the  Apennines  there  are  no  more  such  to %0abe  found.  In  whatever  Country  they  are,  if  they  cross  over %0athe  Track  of  a  Cart-wheel,  they  die.  In  Olympus,  a  Moun- %0atain of  Macedonia,  there  are  no  Wolves  ;  nor  in  the  Island %0aof  Crete.  And  there  also  are  no  Foxes  nor  Bears;  and  in %0aone  Word,  no  hurtful  Creature,  except  the  Phalangiurn,2  a %0akind  of  Spider,  of  which  we  will  speak  more  in  its  proper %0aPlace.  It  is  more  surprising  that  in  the  same  Island  there  are %0ano  Deer,  except  only  in  the  Region  of  the  Cydoniates :  no %0awild  Boars  likewise,  nor  the  Attagen,  or  Hedgehogs.  To %0aconclude,  in  Africa  there  are  no  wild  Boars,  no  Stags,  no %0aRoes,  nor  Bears. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIX. %0a%0aWhat  Creatures  are  hurtful  to  Strangers.  • %0a%0aSOME  Creatures  there  are  which  do  no  Harm  to  the  Na- %0atives of  the  Country,  but  kill  all  Strangers  :  such  as  some %0asmall  Serpents  in  Tirinthe,  which  are  supposed  to  be  pro- %0aduced out  of  the  Earth.  So,  in  Syria,  there  are  Snakes, %0aespecially  along  the  Banks  of  the  Euphrates,  that  do  not %0atouch  the  Syrians  while  l}ing  asleep;  and  even  if  a  Native %0atreads  upon  them  and  receives  a  Bite,  he  does  not  receive %0aany  Hurt ;  but  to  the  People  of  any  other  Nation  they  are %0a%0a1  Sorex  araneus.  —  LINN.     The  Shrew.  —  Among  the  ancients  the %0aShrew-mouse  had  a  very  bad  reputation.     Thus  Aristotle  declares  that %0aits  bite  is  dangerous  to  horses  and  other  beasts  of  burden ;  and  that  it  is %0amore  dangerous  if  the  Shrew-mouse  be  with  young.      The  bite,  he  says, %0acauses  boils,  and  these  burst,  if  the  Shrew-mouse  be  pregnant  when  she %0ainflicts  the  wound ;  but  if  she  be  not,  they  do  not  burst. — "  Hist.

They  are  thought  also  to %0a%3c have  an  Understanding  of  Religion1  in  others  ;  for  when  they %0a%3c are  to  pass  the  Seas  they  will  not  enter  the  Ships  before  they %0a%3c are  induced  to  it  by  an  Oath  of  their  Governors  that  they %0a%3c shall  return  again;  and  they  have  been  seen  enfeebled  by %0a%3c Sickness  (for  as  Large  as  they  are  they  are  subject  to  Sick- %0a%3c ness), to  lie  upon  their  Backs,  throwing  up  Herbs  toward %0a%3c Heaven,  as  if  they  had  procured  the  Earth  to  pray  for  them. %0a%3c Now  for  their  Docility  :  they  adore  the  King,  they  kneel  and %0a%3c offer  Chaplets  of  Flowers.  The  lesser  sort,  which  they  call %0a%3c Bastards,  serve  the  Indians  to  Plough  their  Ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c When  Elephants  were  first  put  to  Draw. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  first  time  they  were  known  to  Draw  at  Rome  was  in %0a%3c the  Chariot  of  Pompey  the  Great,  in  the  African  Triumph. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  author  in  several  places  speaks  of  religion  in  animals :  as  of %0a%3c monkeys,  b.  viii.  c.  54,  and  of  barn-door  poultry,  b.  x.  c.  41.  The  oryx %0a%3c was  judged  to  be  impious,  because  it  had  been  seen  to  display  signs  of  dis- %0a%3c regard or  contempt  to  the  moon.  To  understand  the  ground  of  this %0a%3c opinion,  it  is  necessary  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  religion  of  the  heathens %0a%3c did  not  include  or  demand  a  spiritual  attachment,  or  mental  conformity, %0a%3c to  the  character  or  commands  of  the  object  worshipped,  but  was  merely %0a%3c ritual :  the  latreia  being  an  official  service  which  was  employed  to  allay %0a%3c the  anger  of  some  divinity,  which  had  been  raised  by  some  cause  equally %0a%3c remote  from  any  feeling  of  a  moral  nature  with  that  instituted  to  obviate %0a%3c it.  The  real  cultus  was  comprised  in  this  ceremony,  and  religion  was  the %0a%3c binding  of  this  cultus,  or  worship,  on  those  who  were  subject  to  it  —  as %0a%3c superstition  included  the  employment  of  a  greater  amount  of  ceremony %0a%3c than  the  latreia  demanded ;  and  as  this  was  judged  to  proceed  from  a %0a%3c greater  degree  of  fear  than  the  cause  required,  it  was  always  considered %0a%3c as  degrading  him  that  manifested  it.  As  the  proper  idea  of  religion  was %0a%3c supposed  to  be  the  binding  of  the  cultus  on  those  only  who  were  the  sub- %0a%3c jects of  it,  it  was  no  great  extension  of  the  same  principle  to  suppose  that %0a%3c animals  might  be  subject  to  the  same  laws  as  men  in  these  respects,  and %0a%3c that  they  might  have  recourse  to  means  of  a  similar  kind  to  obviate %0a%3c similar  offences.  That  the  elephant  practised  religious  rites  was  not  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  5 %0a%3c %0a%3c But  long  before  this  it  is  said  that  Father  Liber  did  the %0a%3c same  in  his  Triumph  for  having  Conquered  India.  Prod- %0a%3c lius  denieth  that,  coupled  as  they  were,  two  in  one  Yoke, %0a%3c they  could  possibly  have  entered  in  at  the  Gates  of  Rome  in %0a%3c Pompey's  Triumph.  In  the  Show  of  Gladiators,  which  Ger- %0a%3c manicus  Ccssar  exhibited,  the  Elephants  were  seen  to  show %0a%3c some  disorderly  Motions,  after  a  manner  of  Dancing.  It  was %0a%3c a  common  thing  to  fling  Weapons  through  the  Air,  so  that %0a%3c the  Winds  had  no  power  against  them  ;  to  flourish  and  meet %0a%3c together  in  Fight  like  Gladiators,  and  to  make  Sport  in  a %0a%3c Pyrrhic  Dance ;  and  afterwards  to  go  on  Ropes ;  to  carry %0a%3c (four  together1)  one  of  them  laid  at  ease  in  a  Litter,  re- %0a%3c sembling the  manner  of  Women  newly  brought  to  Bed  ;  and %0a%3c some  of  them  would  enter  a  Dining-place  where  the  Tables %0a%3c were  full  of  Guests,  and  pass  among  them  with  their  foot- %0a%3c opinion  of  Pliny  only,  but  appears  to  have  been  common  in  ancient  times. %0a%3c ^Elian,  whose  "  History  of  the  Peculiar  Nature  of  Animals  "  is  chiefly %0a%3c valuable  for  containing  everything  on  the  subject  that  floated  on  the  sur- %0a%3c face of  popular  observation,  says,  "  At  the  first  appearance  of  the  new %0a%3c moon  I  have  heard  that  elephants  leave  the  woods  under  the  influence  of %0a%3c a  certain  natural  and  inexpressible  intelligence,  bearing  with  them %0a%3c branches  which  they  have  plucked  from  the  trees,  which  they  bear %0a%3c aloft  and  wave  to  and  fro  as  they  cast  their  looks  upward,  as  if  offering %0a%3c some  divine  intercession  to  the  goddess  to  be  propitious  and  gracious  to %0a%3c them." — B.  iv.  c.  x.  "  They  also  worship  the  rising  sun  by  lifting  up  their %0a%3c trunks,  like  hands,  to  meet  his  rays,  and  on  this  account  they  are  dear  to %0a%3c the  god ;  and  of  this  fact  Ptolemy  Philopator  is  an  excellent  and  un- %0a%3c doubted witness." — B.  vii.  c.  14.  The  reference  of  the  author  to  this  sove- %0a%3c reign is  built  on  a  remarkable  dream  which  he  had  on  the  occasion  of %0a%3c having  offered  the  unusual  sacrifice  of  four  elephants  on  occasion  of  a %0a%3c victory.  The  solemn  ceremonies  of  the  elephant  on  occasion  of  the  death %0a%3c of  those  of  their  own  kind  are  referred  to  in  the  same  work,  b.  v.  c.  49. %0a%3c Their  adoration  of  the  king  was  the  result  of  discipline,  b.  xiii.  c.  22  ;  and %0a%3c they  also  formed  his  night-watch,  when  perhaps  he  had  learned  to  dis- %0a%3c trust the  fidelity  of  his  guards. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  If  the  elephants  walked  two  and  two,  as  they  probably  did  when %0a%3c thus  carrying  their  companion,  there  must  have  been  two  ropes  placed %0a%3c in  parallel  lines.  JElian,  "  De  Animalibus,"  gives  a  most  amusing  account %0a%3c of  the  performances  of  the  elephants  of  Germanicus  in  the  theatre  ;  but  I %0a%3c do  not  remember  that  he  mentions  this  feat.  A  like  exploit  is,  however, %0a%3c mentioned  by  Seneca,  Suetonius,  and  others. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 6     .  History  of  Nature.

Mutianus, %0a%3c who  had  been  thrice  Consul,  reporteth  that  one  of  them  had %0a%3c Learned  to  make  the  Greek  Letters,  and  was  accustomed  to %0a%3c Write  in  that  Language  thus:  This  have  I  myself  written, %0a%3c and  have  dedicated  the  Celtic  spoils.  Also  himself  saw  at %0a%3c Puteoli,  when  some  Elephants  that  had  been  brought %0a%3c thither  were  forced  to  go  forth  out  of  the  Vessel  in  which %0a%3c they  had  come,  but  being  affrighted  at  the  extent  of  the  way %0a%3c from  the  Ship  to  the  Land,  to  deceive  themselves  so  that %0a%3c the  way  might  not  seem  too  long,  they  went  backward  with %0a%3c their  Tails  to  the  Land.  They  know  that  the  Riches  for %0a%3c which  Men  lie  in  wait  for  them  consisteth  only  in  their %0a%3c Arms,  which  Juba  calleth  their  Horns  ;  but  which  Herodotus, %0a%3c who  wrote  long  before  him,  and  custom,  hath  better  termed %0a%3c Teeth.  And  therefore  when  they  are  fallen  off,  either  from %0a%3c Age,  or  by  some  Accident,  the  Elephants  themselves  hide %0a%3c them  in  the  Ground.  And  this  is  the  only  Ivory ;  for  all  the %0a%3c rest,  and  the  Teeth  themselves  so  far  as  they  are  covered %0a%3c within  the  Flesh,  is  no  better  than  common  Bone.  And  yet %0a%3c of  late  for  scarcity  Men  have  taken  up  to  cut  the  Bones  into %0a%3c Plates.  For  it  is  rare  to  procure  Teeth  of  any  bigness  except %0a%3c from  India ;  since  all  the  rest  in  our  part  of  the  World  hath %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Plutarch,  "  De  Solert.  Anim."  tells  us  of  an  elephant  who  practised %0a%3c bis  parts  by  moonlight  of  his  own  accord.—  Wern.

You  may  know  young  Ele- %0a%3c phants by  the  Whiteness  of  their  Teeth,  and  these  Beasts %0a%3c have  a  special  care  over  them.  They  spare  the  Point  of  one %0a%3c of  them,  lest  it  should  be  blunt  when  they  come  to  Fight ; %0a%3c and  the  other  they  use  ordinarily,  either  to  dig  up  Roots  or %0a%3c to  throw  down  Banks.  When  they  are  compassed  round %0a%3c with  Hunters,  they  set  in  the  foremost  rank  those  which %0a%3c have  the  least  Teeth,  that  their  price  may  not  be  thought %0a%3c worth  the  hazard  of  Battle.  But  afterwards,  when  they  are %0a%3c weary,  they  break  them  by  driving  them  into  the  Trees,  and %0a%3c so  ransom  themselves  by  the  prey. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IV. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Clemency  of  Elephants ;    their  Knowledge  of  their  own %0a%3c Dangers  ;  also  the  Fierceness  of  the  Tiyer. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  a  wonder  in  most  Animals  that  they  know  why  they %0a%3c are  Hunted ;  and  through  the  whole  they  understand  what %0a%3c to  guard  against.  If  an  Elephant  chance  to  meet  a  Man %0a%3c wandering  simply  out  of  his  way  in  the  Wilderness,  it  is  said %0a%3c that  he  will  mildly  and  peaceably  set  him  in  the  right  way %0a%3c again.  But  if  he  perceive  a  Man's  footstep  before  he  dis- %0a%3c covers the  Man,  he  will  tremble  for  fear  of  being  entrapped ; %0a%3c he  will  stay  from  the  Scent,  look  about  him  every  way,  and %0a%3c puff  for  very  anger.  Neither  will  he  tread  upon  the  Track,  but %0a%3c dig  it  out  and  give  it  to  the  next  (Elephant),  and  he  again  to %0a%3c him  that  followeth,  in  the  way  of  a  Message,  to  the  furthest %0a%3c rank  behind.  Then  the  whole  Herd  wheels  round  and  re- %0a%3c turns backward,  putting  themselves  in  Battle  Array  :  so  long %0a%3c continueth  that  strong  Smell  of  Men's  Feet  through  them %0a%3c all,  notwithstanding  for  the  most  part  they  have  not  naked %0a%3c Feet,  So  the  Tigress  also,  though  fierce  to  other  wild %0a%3c Beasts,  and  disregarding  the  footsteps  of  the  Elephant %0a%3c itself,  if  she  happen  to  catch  sight  of  a  Man  is  said  im- %0a%3c mediately to  convey  away  her  Whelps.  How  cometh %0a%3c she  to  this  knowledge  of  a  Man  ?  Where  did  she  ever  see %0a%3c him  before  whom  she  thus  feareth  ?  For  surely  such  Forests %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c are  very  little  frequented  by  Men.  They  may  indeed  well %0a%3c wonder  at  the  novelty  of  their  Tracks,  bat  how  know  they %0a%3c that  they  are  to  be  feared  ?  Nay,  what  should  be  the  reason %0a%3c that  they  dread  even  to  see  a  Man,  being  so  much  superior %0a%3c in  Strength,  Size,  and  Swiftness  ?  Certainly  herein  is  the %0a%3c wonderful  work  of  Nature,  and  her  mighty  Power ;  that  the %0a%3c greatest  and  fiercest  of  wild  Beasts,  which  have  never  seen %0a%3c that  which  they  ought  to  fear,  yet  immediately  understand %0a%3c why  the  same  is  to  be  dreaded. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  V. %0a%3c The  Understanding  and  Memory  of  Elephants. %0a%3c %0a%3c ELEPHANTS  march  always  in  Troops.  The  oldest  of  them %0a%3c leadeth  the  Company,  and  the  next  to  him  in  age  cometh %0a%3c behind  with  the  conduct  of  the  Rear.  When  they  are  to  pass %0a%3c over  a  River,  they  put  the  Smallest  foremost,  lest  if  the %0a%3c Larger  should  enter  first  they  would  dig  up  the  Channel,  and %0a%3c so  make  the  Torrent  to  become  deeper.  Anti.pat.er  writeth, %0a%3c that  King  Antiochus  had  two  Elephants  which  he  used  in %0a%3c his  Wars,  and  were  famous  for  their  Surnames,  which  they %0a%3c knew  well.  And  truly  Cato,  when  he  named  in  his  Annals %0a%3c the  Commanders  (Imperators),  hath  recorded  that  the  (Ele- %0a%3c phant) which  fought  most  bravely  in  the  Punic  Contest  was %0a%3c named  Surus,  and  that  one  of  his  Teeth  was  lost.  When %0a%3c Antiochus  would  have  sounded  the  passage  of  a  River  (by %0a%3c putting  the  Elephants  before),  Ajax  refused,  although  at  all %0a%3c times  he  was  the  leader  of  the  Troop.  On  this  it  was  pro- %0a%3c nounced that  the  Elephant  which  would  pass  should  be  the %0a%3c Chief;  and  Patroclus  having  ventured,  as  a  reward  there %0a%3c was  presented  to  him  a  rich  set  of  Silver  Trappings  (a  thing %0a%3c in  which  they  take  very  great  Delight) ;  and  besides  this, %0a%3c he  was  made  the  Sovereign  of  the  others.  But  the  other, %0a%3c which  was  distinguished  (by  his  Abstaining  from  Food)  pre- %0a%3c ferred Death  to  the  Shame :  for  they  are  wonderfully %0a%3c Bashful,  so  that  if  one  of  them  be  overcome  he  will  fly  from %0a%3c the  voice  of  the  Conqueror,  and  put  forward  Earth  arid  Ver- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  9 %0a%3c %0a%3c vain.1  Through  Modesty  they  never  associate  in  Love  except %0a%3c in  secret :  the  Male  at  five  Years  of  Age,  and  the  Female  at %0a%3c ten  Years  old.  And  this  they  do  every  third  Year,2  and  they %0a%3c continue  therein  five  Days  in  the  Year  (as  they  say)  and  not %0a%3c more,  for  upon  the  sixth  Day  they  Wash  themselves  over  in %0a%3c the  River  ;  and  before  this  they  do  not  return  to  the  Herd. %0a%3c They  know  no  adulterous  change  ;  neither  are  there  any %0a%3c Battles  among  them  about  their  Females,  as  among  other %0a%3c Animals  to  their  great  injury.  And  this  is  not  for  want  of %0a%3c strong  Affection ;  for  it  is  reported  of  an  Elephant  that  he %0a%3c was  enamoured  of  a  certain  Woman  in  Egypt  who  sold  Gar- %0a%3c lands of  Flowers.  And  lest  any  one  should  think  that  she %0a%3c was  an  ordinary  maiden  that  was  beloved,  she  was  greatly %0a%3c admired  by  Aristophanes,  the  excellent  Grammarian.  There %0a%3c was  another  so  full  of  Love  to  a  Youth  in  the  Army  of  Ptolo- %0a%3c mceus,  that  if  he  did  not  see  him  every  Day  he  would  abstain %0a%3c from  his  Meat.  Juba  likewise  reporteth  of  an  Elephant  that %0a%3c loved  a  Woman  who  sold  Perfumes.  All  these  shewed  their %0a%3c Love  by  the  tokens  of  Joy  at  the  sight  of  the  object  of  their %0a%3c regard,  by  their  rude  Blandishments,  and  by  preserving  the %0a%3c Gifts  which  the  People  gave  them,  and  laying  them  in  their %0a%3c Bosoms.  Nor  is  Love  so  much  to  be  wondered  at  where  the %0a%3c Memory  is  so  good.  For  the  same  Juba  saith,  that  an  Ele- %0a%3c phant acknowledged  a  Man  in  his  old  Age,  and  after  many %0a%3c Years,  who  in  his  youth  had  been  his  Governor.  He %0a%3c affirmeth  also  that  they  have  a  certain  Divine  Instinct  of %0a%3c Justice  :  for  when  King  Bacchus  had  appointed  to  be  re- %0a%3c venged on  thirty  Elephants,  which  he  had  caused  to  be %0a%3c bound  to  Stakes,  and  had  set  the  same  number  to  run  upon %0a%3c them,  appointing  also  Men  to  urge  them  to  rush  forward ; %0a%3c yet  they  were  riot  able  to  cause  them  to  become  the  Ministers %0a%3c of  another's  Cruelty. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  greatest  sign  of  victory  in  old  time  was  for  the  vanquished  to %0a%3c offer  a  plant  to  the  conqueror,  which  signified  that  he  surrendered  all  the %0a%3c interests  he  had  in  earth,  and  even  the  rite  of  burial.

But  in  Rome  it  was  seven  Years %0a%3c after  this  before  they  were  seen,  and  then  in  a  Triumph.  But %0a%3c in  the  Year  502,  a  Number  of  them  were  seen,  being  taken %0a%3c from  the  Carthaginians  in  the  Victory  of  L.  Metellus  Pontifex %0a%3c in  Sicily.  142  were  conveyed  over  on  Rafts,  which  were  laid %0a%3c upon  Rows  of  great  Tuns  placed  close  one  by  another.  Ver- %0a%3c rius  saith  that  they  fought  in  the  Circus,  and  were  killed  with %0a%3c Darts,  for  want  of  better  Counsel  ;  for  they  were  neither %0a%3c willing  to  feed  them,1  nor  to  bestow  them  upon  Kings.  L.  Piso %0a%3c saith  they  were  only  brought  out  into  the  Circus ;  and  to %0a%3c make  them  contemptible,  they  were  driven  round  it  by  cer- %0a%3c tain hired  Fellows,  having  for  that  purpose  Spears  simply %0a%3c headed  with  Iron.  But  what  became  of  them  afterward, %0a%3c those  Authors  make  no  mention ;  but  they  are  of  opinion, %0a%3c that  they  were  not  killed. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VII. %0a%3c Their  Combats. %0a%3c %0a%3c MUCH  renowned  is  the  Contest  of  one  Roman  with  an %0a%3c Elephant,  when  Annibal  forced  our  Captives  to  skirmish  one %0a%3c against  another.  For  the  only  Roman  that  remained,  he %0a%3c matched  with  an  Elephant,  having  covenanted  with  him, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Romans  might  well  shrink  from  the  expense  of  supporting  142 %0a%3c elephants,  when,  as  we  are  informed,  the  quantity  of  food  required  for  the %0a%3c daily  consumption  of  a  full-grown  elephant  is  not  less  than  200  pounds  of %0a%3c aliment  of  all  sorts.  The  elephant  of  Louis  XIV.  had  daily  80  pounds %0a%3c of  bread,  12  pints  of  wine,  and  a  large  quantity  of  vegetable  soup,  with %0a%3c bread  and  rice ;  this  was  exclusive  of  grass,  and  what  he  got  from  visi- %0a%3c tors. —  Wcrn.

So %0a%3c this  Prisoner  entered  into  single  Fight  with  the  Elephant, %0a%3c and  to  the  great  Grief  of  the  Carthaginians,  slew  him.  An- %0a%3c nibal,  considering  that  the  Report  of  this  Combat  would %0a%3c cause  these  Beasts  to  be  little  regarded,  sent  after  him  some %0a%3c Light  Horsemen  to  kill  him  upon  the  Way.  Their  Trunk %0a%3c (Proboscis)  may  be  easily  cut  off;  as  appeared  by  Experience %0a%3c in  the  Battles  of  Pyrrhus.  Fenestella  writeth,  that  the  first %0a%3c Fight  of  them  in  Rome  was  in  the  Circus,  when  Claudius %0a%3c Pulcker  was  Curule  jEdile,  and  M.  Antonius  and  A.  Post- %0a%3c humius  were  Consuls,  in  the  six  hundred  and  fiftieth  Year %0a%3c of  the  City.  Also  20  Years  after,  when  the  Luculli  were %0a%3c Curule  .ZEdiles,  they  fought  against  Bulls.  Also  in  the %0a%3c second  Consulship  of  Cn.  Pompeius,  at  the  Dedication  of  the %0a%3c Temple  to  Venus  Victoress,  20  of  them,  or  as  some  write,  17, %0a%3c fought  in  the  Circus.  The  Gaetulians  threw  Darts  against %0a%3c them.  But  one  Elephant  did  Wonders :  for  when  his  Feet %0a%3c were  pierced  through  with  Darts,  he  crept  upon  his  Knees %0a%3c among  the  Companies,  where  he  caught  from  them  their %0a%3c Shields,  and  flung  them  aloft,  which,  as  they  fell,  turned %0a%3c round  as  if  by  Art,  and  not  as  if  thrown  with  Violence  by %0a%3c the  Beasts  in  their  Anger,  to  the  great  Pleasure  of  the  Be- %0a%3c holders. And  as  strange  a  Thing  was  seen  in  another  of %0a%3c them,  who  was  killed  with  one  Stroke ;  for  the  Dart  was %0a%3c driven  under  the  Eye,  and  pierced  to  the  vital  Parts  of  the %0a%3c Head.  Whereupon  all  the  rest  endeavoured  to  burst  away, %0a%3c not  without  a  great  disturbance  among  the  People,  although %0a%3c fenced  round  with  Iron  Bars.  And  for  this  Cause,  Ccesar %0a%3c the  Dictator,  when  afterwards  he  was  about  to  exhibit  the %0a%3c like  Show,  cast  a  Ditch  round  about  the  Arena ;  which  Prince %0a%3c Nero  removed  to  make  room  for  the  Knights.  But  those %0a%3c Elephants  of  Pompey  being  past  all  Hope  of  escaping,  in  a %0a%3c Manner  that  cannot  be  expressed  seemed  to  supplicate  the %0a%3c Multitude,  craving  their  Mercy,  with  grievous  Lamentations %0a%3c bewailing  their  Condition ;  so  that  the  People's  Hearts %0a%3c melted,  and  with  Tears  in  their  Eyes,  they  rose  up  all  at %0a%3c once,  without  Regard  to  the  Imperator,  or  Respect  to  his %0a%3c magnificent  Display,  and  imprecated  on  Pompey  these  severe %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 12  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Misfortunes  which  soon  after  ensued  accordingly.  Again, %0a%3c Ccesar  the  Dictator,  in  his  third  Consulship,  exhibited  ano- %0a%3c ther Fight  of  them ;  20  against  500  Footmen  ;  and  a  second %0a%3c Time  20  more,  having  Turrets  with  60  Defendants  to  the %0a%3c same ;  and  he  opposed  against  them  the  same  Number  as %0a%3c the  former  of  Footmen,  and  as  many  Horse.  After  this, %0a%3c Claudius  and  JVero,  the  Princes,  brought  them  forth  one  by %0a%3c one,  by  way  of  finishing  the  Show  of  Gladiators.  This %0a%3c Animal  is  reported  to  be  so  gentle  to  all  that  are  not  so %0a%3c strong  as  himself,  that  if  he  meet  a  Flock  of  Cattle,  he  will %0a%3c with  the  Hand  remove  any  that  cometh  in  his  Way,  for  Fear %0a%3c he  should  crush  them  without  being  aware  of  it.  And  they %0a%3c never  do  any  Hurt  unless  provoked.  They  always  walk  in %0a%3c Troops,  and  are  less  disposed  to  wandering  alone  than  any %0a%3c other  Animals.  If  they  are  environed  with  Horsemen,  they %0a%3c take  into  the  midst  of  the  Troop  the  feeble,  weary,  or  wounded ; %0a%3c and  as  if  they  were  under  the  Direction  of  a  General,  or  with %0a%3c the  Guidance  of  Reason,  they  succeed  one  another  in  their %0a%3c Course.  When  taken,  they  are  soonest  brought  to  be  tame %0a%3c with  the  Juice  of  Barley.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VIII. %0a%3c The  Manner  of  taking  Elephants. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Indians  take  Elephants  in  this  manner :  the  Go- %0a%3c vernor employeth  one  of  them  that  are  tame,  and  when  he %0a%3c meeteth  with  a  wild  one  alone,  or  can  single  him  from  the %0a%3c Herd,  he  beateth  him  until  he  hath  made  him  weary,  and %0a%3c then  he  mounteth  on  him  and  ruleth  him  as  well  as  the  former. %0a%3c In  Africa  they  catch  them  in  Pit-falls;  into  which,  if  one  of %0a%3c them  wander,  all  the  rest  immediately  heap  together  Boughs %0a%3c of  Trees,  they  roll  down  Heaps,  they  raise  Banks,  and  with %0a%3c all  they  can  do,  labour  to  draw  him  out.  Formerly  when %0a%3c they  meant  to  make  them  tractable,  by  the  Help  of  Horse- %0a%3c men they  drove  the  Flocks  along  into  a  Valley  made  by %0a%3c Man's  Hand,  and  calculated  to  deceive  them  for  a  consider- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  is,  gruel,  or  tissane,  as  we  may  suppose.  —  Wern.

But  now,  since  they %0a%3c seek  after  them  for  the  sake  of  their  Teeth,  they  throw  Darts %0a%3c at  their  Legs,  which  are  the  softest  Part  of  their  Body.  The %0a%3c Trogloditee,1  a  People  bordering  on  Ethiopia,  who  live  only %0a%3c by  hunting  Elephants,  climb  the  Trees  that  are  near  their %0a%3c Walk,  and  from  thence  watching  all  the  Herd  as  they  pass, %0a%3c they  leap  down  upon  the  Buttocks  of  the  hindmost;  then  he, %0a%3c with  his  left  Hand,  layeth  hold  of  the  Tail,  and  setteth  his %0a%3c Feet  fast  in  the  Flank  of  the  left  Side ;  and  so  hanging,  with %0a%3c his  right  Hand  he  cutteth  the  Hamstrings  of  one  of  his  Legs %0a%3c with  a  very  sharp  double-edged  Knife ;  which  done,  the %0a%3c Elephant  slackening  his  Pace,  the  Man  then  maketh  escape, %0a%3c and  divideth  the  Sinews  likewise  of  the  other  Ham  ;  and  all %0a%3c this  Execution  he  doth  with  wonderful  Agility.  Others  have %0a%3c a  safer  Way  than  this,  but  it  is  more  deceitful :  they  fix  in %0a%3c the  Ground  a  great  Way  off,  very  great  Bows  ready  bent; %0a%3c to  hold  these  fast  they  choose  young  Men  remarkable  for %0a%3c their  Strength,  and  others  united  together  draw  with  all %0a%3c Might  these  Bows  against  the  first,  and  so  they  pierce  the %0a%3c Elephants  as  they  pass  with  Javelins,  and  then  follow  them %0a%3c by  their  Blood.  Of  these  Creatures,  the  Females  are  much %0a%3c more  fearful  than  the  Males. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  These  people  are  often  mentioned  by  Pliny,  and  are  particularly %0a%3c described  by  Heliodorus  (2Ethiopics,  b.  viii.) :  "  They  are  a  people  of %0a%3c Ethiopia,  and  live  by  grazing.  These  people  are  extremely  swift  of  foot, %0a%3c as  well  by  nature  as  by  continued  exercise  from  their  childhood :  of  little %0a%3c use  in  close  fight,  but  very  serviceable  with  their  slings,  which  they  gall %0a%3c their  enemy  with  at  a  distance ;  and  if  they  find  themselves  overpowered, %0a%3c they  fly,  secured  by  their  swiftness,  and  by  running  into  holes  and  caverns %0a%3c among  the  rocks,  where  no  enemy  ever  found  it  worth  their  while  to  follow %0a%3c them."  The  Agagees,  as  mentioned  by  Mr.  Bruce,  in  his  "  Travels  into %0a%3c Abyssinia,"  appear  to  be  a  similar  race  of  men ;  although  the  object  of %0a%3c pursuit  is  a  different  animal.  —  Wern.

When  tamed,  they  serve  in  War,  and  carry %0a%3c little  Castles  with  armed  Soldiers  among  the  Enemies  j1  and %0a%3c for  the  most  Part  they  decide  the  Wars  of  the  East.  They %0a%3c bear  down  the  Body  of  the  Army,  and  stamp  them  (the %0a%3c armed  Men)  under  Foot.  But  these  same  are  affrighted %0a%3c with  the  Grunting  of  Swine  ;  and  if  wounded  or  put  into %0a%3c a  Fright,  they  always  go  backward,  with  scarcely  less  Mis- %0a%3c chief to  their  own  Side.  The  African  Elephants  are  afraid %0a%3c of  the  Indian,  and  dare  not  look  upon  them  ;  for  the  Indian %0a%3c Elephants  are  much  bigger.2 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  X. %0a%3c %0a%3c How  they  Bring  forth  their  Young;  and  of  other  Parts  of %0a%3c their  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  the  common  Opinion  that  they  go  with  Young  ten %0a%3c Years ;  but  Aristotle  saith,  that  they  go  but  two  Years,  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Or  on  their  backs  (a  various  reading),  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  Philostratus  and  Polybius  confirm  this  statement  of  Pliny,  that  the %0a%3c Indian  elephant  is  larger  than  that  of  Africa ;  and  ^Elian  says,  that  it %0a%3c attains  the  height  of  nine  cubits.    But  modern  authors  generally  consider %0a%3c the  African  species  the  larger, — at  least  larger  than  the  common  elephant %0a%3c of  Hindostan.     Mr.  Corse,  formerly  superintendent  of  the  East  India %0a%3c Company's  elephants  at  Tiperah,  a  province  of  Bengal,  never  heard  of %0a%3c but  one  Indian  elephant  whose  height  reached  ten  feet  six  inches.     The %0a%3c elephants  of  Hindostan  are,  however,  the  smallest  of  the  Asiatic  species. %0a%3c Those  of  Pegu  and  Ava  are  much  larger  ;  and  the  skeleton  of  the  elephant %0a%3c at  the  Museum  of  Petersburgh,  which  was  sent  to  the  Czar  Peter  by  the %0a%3c King  of  Persia,  measures  sixteen  feet  and  a  half  in  height.  —  Wern.

Their  Condition  of  Youth  beginneth  when  they %0a%3c are  threescore  Years  old  :  they  greatly  delight  in  Rivers,  and %0a%3c they  wander  about  Waters  ;  when  otherwise,  by  reason  of  the %0a%3c Magnitude  of  their  Bodies,  they  cannot  swim.1  They  are %0a%3c impatient  of  Cold.  The  greatest  Evil  which  befals  them  is, %0a%3c Distension  and  Purging  of  the  Bowels ;  nor  do  they  suffer %0a%3c from  any  other  kinds  of  Sickness.  I  find  that  if  they  drink  Oil, %0a%3c the  Darts  which  stick  in  their  Bodies  will  fall  off,  but  if  they %0a%3c sweat  the  more  easily  will  they  hold  fast.  The  eating  of %0a%3c Earth  causes  wasting  in  them,  unless  they  chew  well  and %0a%3c often  :  they  devour  Stones  also.  The  Trunks  of  Trees  is  the %0a%3c best  Meat  they  have.  They  will  overturn  the  higher  Palm- %0a%3c trees  with  their  Forehead,  and  eat  the  Dates  as  they  lie %0a%3c along.  They  chew  their  Meat  with  their  Mouth  :  but  they %0a%3c breathe,  drink,  and  smell  with  what  is  not  improperly  called %0a%3c their  Hand.  Of  all  living  Creatures  they  most  detest  a %0a%3c Mouse;2  and  if  they  perceive  that  their  Provender  lying  in %0a%3c the  Manger  hath  been  touched  by  it,  they  will  not  touch  it. %0a%3c They  are  mightily  tormented  with  Pain,  if  in  their  drinking %0a%3c they  swallow  down  a  Leech  ;  which  Creature,  I  observe,  they %0a%3c begin  now  commonly  to  call  a  Bloodsucker,  (Sanyuisuga) : %0a%3c for  when  the  Leech  hath  fixed  itself  in  the  Windpipe,  it  put- %0a%3c teth  him  to  intolerable  Pain.  The  Hide  of  their  Back  is %0a%3c most  hard;3  but  in  the  Belly  it  is  soft;  their  Skin  has  no %0a%3c covering  of  Hair ;  and  even  in  their  Tail  there  is  no  Defence %0a%3c which  might  serve  to  drive  away  the  Annoyance  of  Flies  (for %0a%3c as  huge  a  Beast  as  he  is,  he  feeleth  it) ;  but  their  Skin  is  full %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  scarcely  needs  be  observed  that  the  elephant  swims  as  well  as %0a%3c any  other  quadruped.  In  this  act  he  will  frequently  immerse  his  whole %0a%3c body,  so  that  the  tip  of  his  trunk  only  is  above  water,  to  the  no  slight %0a%3c inconvenience  of  those  who  chance  to  be  riding  on  his  back.  —  Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  JElian  says  (B.  i.  c.  38),  that  it  dreads  the  grunting  of  a  hog,  and  a %0a%3c horned  ram ;  and  it  was  by  employing  these  that  the  Romans  put  to  flight %0a%3c the  elephants  of  King  Pyrrhus,  by  which  they  obtained  a  decisive  victory. %0a%3c —  Wern.

The %0a%3c Dragon,  therefore,  espying  the  Elephant  going  to  its  Food, %0a%3c throweth  itself  on  it  from  a  high  Tree ;  this  Creature, %0a%3c knowing  its  Inability  by  struggling  to  withstand  the  other's %0a%3c Windings  about  it,  seeketh  to  crush  its  Enemy  against  the %0a%3c Trees  or  Rocks.  The  Dragons  guard  against  this  by  en- %0a%3c tangling its  Progress  first  with  their  Tail;  the  Elephants %0a%3c undo  those  Knots  with  their  Hand :  but  the  Dragons  put %0a%3c their  Heads  into  their  Snout,  and  so  shut  out  their  Breath, %0a%3c and  tear  the  tenderest  Parts.  When  these  two  chance  to %0a%3c encounter  each  other  on  the  Way,  the  Dragons  raise  them- %0a%3c selves against  their  Enemies,  and  aim  chiefly  at  the  Eyes, %0a%3c whereby  it  happeneth  that  many  Times  they  (the  Ele- %0a%3c phants) are  found  blind,  and  worn  away  with  Hunger %0a%3c and  Grief.

But  some %0a%3c report  this  Contest  in  another  Manner ;  and  that  the  Occa- %0a%3c sion of  it  ariseth  from  the  Elephant's  Blood  being  exceed- %0a%3c ingly Cold,  on  which  Account  chiefly  the  Dragons  search  it %0a%3c out  during  the  parching  Season  of  the  Year.  And  to  the %0a%3c same  Purpose  they  lie  under  the  Water  in  Rivers,  watching %0a%3c for  the  Elephants  when  they  are  drinking;  when  they  catch %0a%3c fast  hold  of  their  Hand  (Trunk),  and  having  clasped  it,  they %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  chapter  offers  a  poor  developement  of  a  universal  principle  in %0a%3c nature,  by  which  the  character  of  every  animal  is  displayed  in  its  re- %0a%3c sources of  pursuit  and  defence.  For  its  exemplification  in  the  habits  of %0a%3c British  animals,  the  reader  is  referred  to  a  work  entitled  "  Illustrations %0a%3c of  Instinct,  derived  from  the  Habits  of  British  Animals,"  by  Jonathan %0a%3c Couch,  F.L.S.— Wern.

These %0a%3c Dragons  are  so  large,  that  they  are  able  to  receive  all  the %0a%3c Elephant's  Blood.  Thus  are  they  sucked  dry  by  them  until %0a%3c they  fall  down  dead  ;  and  the  Dragons  thus  drunken,  are %0a%3c crushed  under  them,  and  both  die  together. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIII. %0a%3c Of  Dragons.* %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  Ethiopia  there  are  produced  as  great  Dragons  as  in %0a%3c India,  being  twenty  Cubits  long.  But  I  chiefly  wonder  at %0a%3c this  one  Thing:  why  Juba  should  think  they  were  Crested. %0a%3c They  are  produced  most  in  a  Country  of  Ethiopia,  where  the %0a%3c People  called  Asachsei  inhabit.  It  is  reported,  that  upon %0a%3c their  Coasts  they  enwrap  themselves  four  or  five  together, %0a%3c in  the  manner  of  a  Bundle  of  Rods,  and  thus  pass  the  Seas, %0a%3c to  find  better  Pasturage  in  Arabia,  bearing  up  their  Heads %0a%3c aloft  as  they  cross  the  Waves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Dragons  are  often  mentioned  by  ancient  authors,  but  without  any %0a%3c marks  by  which  we  can  distinguish  them  from  other  kinds  of  serpents. %0a%3c Their  bulk  did  not  constitute  the  distinction,  for  the  bose  mentioned  in %0a%3c the  following  chapter  are,  at  least,  equally  large.  The  idea  of  ferocity %0a%3c seems  more  directly  to  mix  itself  with  this  class  of  reptiles ;  and  accord- %0a%3c ingly in  the  Septuagint  version  of  the  Scriptures  this  is  the  impression %0a%3c usually  implied  in  the  term.  In  the  29th  chapter  of  the  prophecy  of %0a%3c Ezekiel  the  crocodile  is  signified  by  that  name,  as  it  is  also  by  Marco %0a%3c Polo  in  his  travels ;  but  in  Revel,  c.  xx.  as  in  the  more  ancient  books  of %0a%3c Scripture,  a  large  serpent  is  distinctly  characterised.  Among  the  remark- %0a%3c able things  at  Rome  in  the  days  when  the  strangest  things  were  sought %0a%3c out  to  gratify  extravagant  curiosity,  Suetonius  says  that  Tiberius  pos- %0a%3c sessed a  tame  dragon ;  and  Martial  (Ep.  b.  vii.  c.  70)  makes  it  the  play- %0a%3c thing of  a  lady :— "  Si  gelidum  collo  nectit  Glacilla  Draconem."  The %0a%3c dragon,  as  a  winged  serpent,  was  in  the  middle  ages  often  represented  by %0a%3c the  skin  of  a  skate,  distorted  and  cut  into  form,  by  which  the  opinion  of %0a%3c ?uch  a  monstrous  shape  was  spread  among  the  public. —  Wern.

Metrodorus  saith  that  about  the  River %0a%3c Rhyndacus,  in  Pontus,  there  are  Serpents  which  catch  and %0a%3c devour  the  Fowls  of  the  Air  as  they  fly  over  them,  however %0a%3c high  or  rapid  their  Flight  may  be.  It  is  well  known  that %0a%3c Regulus,  Imperator  during  the  Wars  against  the  Cartha- %0a%3c ginians, near  the  River  Bograda  assailed  a  Serpent  with  his %0a%3c Military  Engines,  the  Balistae  and  Tormentum,  as  he  would %0a%3c have  done  to  a  Town  ;  and  when  Subdued,  the  Length  of  the %0a%3c Serpent  was  found  to  be  120  Feet.  The  Skin  and  Jaws  of %0a%3c this  Serpent  were  preserved  in  a  Temple  at  Rome  until  the %0a%3c War  of  Numantia.  And  this  is  rendered  the  more  credible %0a%3c from  the  Serpents  that  we  see  in  Italy  that  are  called  Boae, %0a%3c which  increase  to  such  Size,  that  in  the  Days  of  the  Prince %0a%3c Dlvus  Claudius  there  was  one  of  them  killed  in  the %0a%3c Vatican,  within  the  Belly  of  which  there  was  found  an  In- %0a%3c fant Child.  They  are  nourished  at  the  first  by  the  Milk  of %0a%3c the  Cow,  from  whence  they  take  their  Name.  As  for  other %0a%3c Animals,  which  of  late  are  often  brought  from  all  Parts  into %0a%3c Italy,  it  is  needless  for  me  to  describe  their  Forms  par- %0a%3c ticularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  monstrous  serpents  recorded  by  ancient  authors,  as  Aristotle, %0a%3c Virgil,  Livy,  Pliny,  and  others,  were  probably  of  the  family  of  bose. %0a%3c Pliny  gives  here  the  derivation  of  the  name  "  boa,"  and  Johnson,  "  Dei- %0a%3c parse  de  Urseolo,"  and  others  observe  that  the  name  is  derived  not  so %0a%3c much  from  the  power  the  animals  have  of  swallowing  oxen,  as  from  a %0a%3c strong  opinion  in  old  times  of  their  following  the  herds,  and  sucking  their %0a%3c udders.  Cuvier  says  the  boae  are  among  the  largest  of  serpents.  Some %0a%3c of  the  species  attain  to  thirty  or  forty  feet  in  length,  and  become  capable %0a%3c of  swallowing  dogs,  deer,  and  even  oxen,  after  having  crushed  them  in %0a%3c their  folds,  and  lubricated  them  with  their  saliva.  The  class  of  bose,  as %0a%3c anciently  understood,  has  been  divided  by  Cuvier  into  two,  boa  and %0a%3c python :  to  which  latter  this  author  supposes  that  serpent  to  have  belonged %0a%3c which  offered  so  formidable  a  resistance  to  the  army  of  Regulus.  Such %0a%3c enormous  serpents  have  long  since  ceased  to  exist  in  Italy. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9Q  History  of  Nature.

Few  likewise  are  in  Germany,  bor- %0a%3c dering on  it;  but  that  Country  possesseth  some  remark- %0a%3c able kinds  of  Wild  Cattle,  as  the  Maned  Bisons,1  and  the %0a%3c Urus,  of  very  great  Strength  and  Swiftness,  which  ignorant %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Urus  Bonasus.  Much  doubt  has  existed  with  regard  to  the %0a%3c distinction  between  these  three  supposed  species  of  oxen,  which  Cuvier %0a%3c resolves  into  two,  the  Bos  Bonasus  of  Linneus;  Zubr,  or  European %0a%3c Bison;  and  the  Urus,  mentioned  in  ancient  times  by  Caesar.  The %0a%3c former  animal  once  roamed  over  the  woodland  districts  of  Central %0a%3c Europe,  and  in  England  was  contemporary  with  the  extinct  races %0a%3c of  elephant  and  rhinoceros ;  but  it  is  now  confined  to  the  forest  of %0a%3c Bialowicza,  in  the  government  of  Grodno,  where  it  is  carefully  pro- %0a%3c tected by  the  imperial  government,  whose  strict  enactments  alone  have %0a%3c saved  it  from  extirpation.  In  Owen's  "  History  of  British  Fossil  Mam- %0a%3c malia," p.  491,  &c.  the  remains  of  animals  of  this  species  are  described %0a%3c as  those  of  the  Bison  Priscus;  and  they  are  found  in  "  various  newer  ter- %0a%3c tiary fresh -water  deposits,  especially  in  Kent  and  Essex,  and  along  the %0a%3c valley  of  the  Thames."  A  young  male  and  female  were  presented  to  the %0a%3c Zoological  Society  of  London,  by  the  Emperor  of  Russia,  in  the  year %0a%3c 1847.  Aristotle  calls  it  Bonasos,  or  Monassos,  and  describes  it  as  living %0a%3c in  Pa3onia,  the  modern  Bulgaria;  but  the  distance  to  which,  in  terror,  it %0a%3c voids  its  excrements,  is  more  moderately  represented  by  him  as  four %0a%3c fathoms  ;  which  Pliny  extends  to  no  less  than  "  tria  jugera,"  or  a  space  of %0a%3c 700  feet.  The  Urus,  also  a  large  species  of  wild  ox,  ranged  the  forests  of %0a%3c Germany  and  Belgium  till  a  late  period  of  the  Roman  empire,  but  is  now %0a%3c extinct.  Its  fossil  remains,  under  the  name  of  Bos  Primigemus,  are  found %0a%3c by  Professor  Owen  in  the  same  deposits  and  localities  as  those  of  the %0a%3c Aurochs,  or  Bison.  The  Urus  was  almost  equal  in  size  to  the  Aurochs, %0a%3c but  differed  from  it  precisely,  as  the  Roman  poets  and  historians  have %0a%3c indicated,  by  the  greater  length  of  its  horns,  and  by  the  absence  of  a %0a%3c copious  mane.  It  appears  to  have  had  a  nearer  affinity  to  the  domestic %0a%3c ox,  resembling  it  probably  in  the  close  nature  of  its  hairy  covering. %0a%3c Cuvier,  Professor  Bell,  and  other  naturalists,  are  disposed  to  believe  that %0a%3c our  domestic  cattle  are  the  degenerate  descendants  of  the  Urus,  but  with %0a%3c this  opinion  Professor  Owen  does  not  concur ;  and  they  are  more  probably %0a%3c to  be  referred  to  the  wild  cattle  still  preserved  in  the  park  at  Shering- %0a%3c ham. —  Wern.

Their  upper  Lip  is  exceeding %0a%3c Great,  and  therefore  as  they  Feed  they  go  backward  ;  for  if %0a%3c they  passed  forward,  it  would  be  folded  double.  There  is %0a%3c (they  say)  a  Wild  Beast  in  Paeonia,  which  is  called  Bonasus, %0a%3c with  a  Mane  like  an  Horse,  but  otherwise  resembling  a %0a%3c Bull ;  arid  his  Horns  bend  so  inwardly,  with  their  Tips %0a%3c toward  the  Head,  that  they  are  of  no  Service  for  Fight,  and %0a%3c therefore  he  hath  recourse  to  Flight  for  Safety  ;  and  in  it %0a%3c throwing  out  his  Dung  at  intervals  to  the  Distance  of  three %0a%3c Acres,  the  Contact  of  which  burneth  them  that  follow,  like  so %0a%3c much  Fire.

This  Africa  seeth  most, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Sir  Charles  Bell,  "  Bridgewater  Treatise,"  p.  102,  says,  "  The  last %0a%3c bone,  which  supports  the  claw,  is  placed  laterally  to  the  next  to  the  last, %0a%3c and  is  so  articulated  with  it  that  an  elastic  ligament  draws  it  back  and %0a%3c raises  the  sharp  extremity  of  the  claw  upwards.   In  the  ordinary  running %0a%3c of  the  animal  the  nearer  extremity  of  the  furthest  bone  presses  the %0a%3c ground,  this  and  the  furthest  extremity  of  the  second  bone,  which  is  also %0a%3c bent  down,  being  received  on  a  pad,  which  acts  as  a  cushion,  and  also  adds %0a%3c to  the  elasticity.   In  this  condition  the  claw  itself  is  received  into  a  sheath %0a%3c above ;  but  when  the  creature  strikes  an  object,  the  claws  are  brought  for- %0a%3c ward, and  bent  under  by  the  action  of  the  flexor  tendons  acting  on  the %0a%3c last  bone,  assisted  by  the  extensors,  which  cause  to  start  upward  the  end %0a%3c of  the  second  bone  as  by  a  spring.    It  is  only  the  excitement  of  seizing  an %0a%3c object  that  can  produce  this  action ;  and  when  this  does  not  exist,  the %0a%3c bones  and  claw  fall  into  their  ordinary  almost  dislocated  condition." — %0a%3c Wern.

Olivier,  "  Voyage  dans %0a%3c 1'Kmpire  Othomau,  1'Egypt,  et  la  Perse,"  tom.iv.  says  that  the  lion  which %0a%3c inhabits  the  part  of  Arabia  and  Persia  near  the  river  of  the  Arabs,  from %0a%3c ilie  Persian  Gulf  to  the  environs  of  Helle  and  of  Bagdad,  is  probably  the %0a%3c species  of  lion  of  which  Aristotle  and  Pliny  have  spoken,  and  which  they %0a%3c regarded  as  a  different  species  from  that  which  is  spread  over  the  interior %0a%3c of  Africa.     This  lion  much  resembles  the  African  species,  excepting  that %0a%3c it  is  smaller  and  has  no  mane.      la  1833  Captain  Since  exhibited  to  a %0a%3c meeting  of  the  Zoological  Society  of  London  the  skins  of  a  lion  and  lioness %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  23 %0a%3c %0a%3c where  for  want  of  Water  the  Wild  Beasts  meet  in  Troops %0a%3c about  the  few  Rivers  that  are  found.  And  hence  it  is  that %0a%3c so  many  strangely  shaped  Beasts  are  there  produced,  for  the %0a%3c Males,  either  by  Force  or  through  Wantonness,  mix  with %0a%3c the  Females  of  various  Kinds.  From  hence  also  proceeds %0a%3c the  common  Greek  Proverb,  That  Africa  is  continually %0a%3c bringing  forth  something  new.1  The  Lion  knoweth  by  Scent %0a%3c of  the  Panther  when  the  Lioness  hath  suffered  his  Embrace  ; %0a%3c and  with  all  his  might  he  punisheth  her  Adultery.  And %0a%3c therefore  she  either  washeth  away  the  Crime  in  a  River, %0a%3c or  else  folio weth  the  Lion  at  a  great  Distance.  I  see  it  is  a %0a%3c commonly  received  Opinion  that  the  Lioness  bringeth  forth %0a%3c Young  but  once,  because  the  Whelps  in  her  Parturition %0a%3c %0a%3c killed  by  him  in  Guzerat.  He  stated  that  this  variety  was  distinguished %0a%3c from  those  previously  known  by  the  absence  of  a  mane  (that  is,  it  is %0a%3c maneless  compared  with  other  lions),  from  the  sides  of  the  neck  and %0a%3c shoulders,  the  middle  line  of  the  back  of  the  neck  being  alone  furnished %0a%3c with  long  hairs,  which  are  erect,  like  those  of  the  same  situation  in  the %0a%3c Cheetah  (Felis  jubatd).  The  under  surface  of  the  neck  has  long  loose %0a%3c silky  hairs,  and  there  is  a  tuft  at  the  angle  of  the  anterior  legs.  Besides1 %0a%3c the  absence  of  the  extensive  mane,  the  tail  is  shorter  than  that  of  ordinary %0a%3c lions,  and  is  furnished  at  its  tip  with  a  much  larger  brush  or  tuft.  Capt. %0a%3c Smee  thus  characterises  his  maneless  lion : — "  Felis  Leo.  LINN.  var.  Gooj- %0a%3c ratensis.

Thus, %0a%3c according  to  Pliny's  theory,  the  Camelopardalis,  or  Giraffe  was  the  off- %0a%3c spring of  the  Camel  and  Panther ;  the  Leopard,  of  the  latter  animal  and %0a%3c the  Lion ;  and  the  Harte-beest  (Antelope  bubalus)  of  the  Antelope  and %0a%3c Buffalo.  But  modern  experience  has  shewn  the  fallacy  of  this  opinion  ; %0a%3c and  we  now  know  that  if  a  hybrid  be  sometimes  produced,  there  the %0a%3c power  of  propagation  ceases.  There  is  no  proof  or  probability  that  any %0a%3c permanent  race  has  risen  into  existence  since  first  individual  creation  pro- %0a%3c ceeded from  the  hand  of  its  Maker ;  and  in  a  wild  condition  it  is  ques- %0a%3c tionable whether  even  a  mongrel  individual  has  been  ever  produced, %0a%3c although  this  has  sometimes  happened  in  captivity. —  Wern.

King  Alexander  the  Great,  having  an %0a%3c ardent  desire  to  know  the  Nature  of  all  living  Creatures, %0a%3c assigned  this  Charge  to  Aristotle,  a  Man  accomplished  in  all %0a%3c kind  of  Science  and  Learning,  and  to  this  effect  commanded %0a%3c some  Thousands  of  Men  through  all  the  Extent  of  Asia  and %0a%3c Greece  to  give  their  Attendance,  including  all  Hunters, %0a%3c Fowlers,  and  Fishers,  that  lived  by  those  Professions.

Which  being  collected  by  me  in  a  nar- %0a%3c row Room,  with  the  addition  of  some  Things  which  he  never %0a%3c knew,  I  beseech  the  Readers  to  take  in  good  part ;  and  for %0a%3c the  Knowledge  of  all  Nature's  Works,  which  that  most  noble %0a%3c of  all  Kings  desired  so  earnestly,  to  make  a  short  Excursion %0a%3c under  my  care.  That  Philosopher  reporteth  that  the  Lioness %0a%3c at  her  first  Litter  bringeth  forth  five  Whelps,  and  every  Year %0a%3c after  fewer  by  one ;  and  when  she  bringeth  but  one  she  be- %0a%3c cometh  Barren.  Her  Whelps  at  the  first  are  without  Shape %0a%3c and  very  Small,  like  Lumps  of  Flesh,  no  bigger  than  Weasels. %0a%3c When  they  are  six  Months  old  they  can  hardly  go,  and  for %0a%3c the  two  first  they  cannot  move.  There  are  also  Lions  in %0a%3c Europe,2  but  only  between  the  Rivers  Achelous  and  Nestus, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Aristotle  is  by  far  the  most  illustrious  naturalist  of  antiquity,  and %0a%3c he  will  not  suffer  by  comparison  with  the  moderns.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5  Lions  are  at  present  confined  to  Asia  and  Africa,  but  that  they  were %0a%3c once  found  in  Europe  there  can  be  no  doubt.  Thus  it  is  recorded  by %0a%3c Herodotus  ("Polym."  vii.  124)  that  the  baggage  camels  of  the  army  of %0a%3c Xerxes  were  attacked  by  lions  in  the  territory  of  Paeonia  and  Crestonia, %0a%3c in  Thracia.

The  Males  lift  up  the  Leg  when  they  micturate,  as %0a%3c Dogs  do;  they  have  a  strong  Breath,  and  their  Bodies  also %0a%3c Smell  rank.  They  Drink  seldom,  and  Eat  but  on  alternate %0a%3c Days ;  and  if  they  Feed  till  they  are  Full  they  abstain  from %0a%3c Meat  for  three  Days.  In  their  Feeding  whatever  they  can %0a%3c Swallow  without  Chewing  goes  down  whole  ;  and  if  they  find %0a%3c their  Belly  not  able  to  receive  their  Greediness,  they  thrust %0a%3c their  Claws  into  their  Throats  to  drag  it  out  again,  that  if %0a%3c they  are  compelled  to  fly  they  may  not  go  away  in  their  Ful- %0a%3c ness. That  they  Live  very  long1  is  proved  by  this  Argument, %0a%3c that  many  of  them  are  found  Toothless.  Polybius,  who %0a%3c accompanied  (Scipio)  JEmilianus,  reporteth  that  when  they %0a%3c are  grown  Aged  they  will  prey  upon  a  Man,  because  their %0a%3c Strength  will  not  hold  out  to  pursue  Wild  Beasts.  Then %0a%3c they  lie  in  wait  about  the  Cities  of  Africa  ;  and  for  that  cause %0a%3c while  he  was  with  Scipio  he  saw  some  of  them  Crucified, %0a%3c that  other  Lions  might  be  scared  from  doing  the  like  Mis- %0a%3c chief by  fear  of  the  same  Punishment.  The  Lion  alone  of %0a%3c all  Wild  Beasts  is  gentle  to  those  that  humble  themselves  to %0a%3c him ;  he  spareth  those  that  lie  Prostrate ;  and  when  he  is %0a%3c furious  he  dischargeth  his  Rage  upon  Men  before  he  setteth %0a%3c upon  Women,  and  never  preyeth  upon  Babes  unless  it  be  for %0a%3c extreme  Hunger.  It  is  believed  in  Libya  that  they  have  an %0a%3c Understanding  of  Prayers  addressed  to  them.  I  have  heard %0a%3c as  a  fact  of  a  Captive  Woman  of  Gaetulia,  who  was  brought %0a%3c back  again  to  her  Master,  that  she  had  pacified  the  Violence %0a%3c %0a%3c Anim."  vi.  31 ;  and  viii.  33),  from  whom  Pliny  seems  to  have  copied, %0a%3c inform  us  that  they  abounded  in  that  part  of  Europe  which  is  between %0a%3c the  Achelous  and  Nessus.  Nor  is  Europe  the  only  part  of  the  world %0a%3c from  which  the  lion  has  disappeared ;  for  it  is  no  longer  to  be  found  in %0a%3c Egypt,  Palestine,  or  Syria,  where  it  once  was  evidently  far  from  uncom- %0a%3c mon, as  we  know  from  the  frequent  allusions  to  it  in  the  Holy  Scriptures. %0a%3c —  Wern.Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Aristotle,  "  Hist.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  It  was  a  common  opinion  among  the  ancients  that  the  lion  lashes  his %0a%3c sides  with  his  tail  to  stimulate  himself  into  rage  ;  hence  Pliny  calls  the %0a%3c tail  the  index  of  the  lion's  mind.  But  they  do  not  seem  to  have  adverted %0a%3c to  any  peculiarity  in  that  member,  to  which  so  extraordinary  a  function %0a%3c might,  however  incorrectly,  be  attributed.  Didymus  Alexandrinus  ap- %0a%3c pears to  have  been  the  first  person  who,  entertaining  this  fancy,  noticed  a %0a%3c prickle  at  the  end  of  the  tail,  in  his  comment  on  the  twentieth  book  of  the %0a%3c Iliad,  where  the  lion's  rage  is  mentioned, — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Such  the  lion's  rage, %0a%3c %0a%3c ***** %0a%3c %0a%3c Lash'd  by  his  tail  his  heaving  sides  resound  ; %0a%3c He  calls  up  all  his  rage." %0a%3c %0a%3c "  The  lion,"  he  says,  "  has  a  black  prickle  on  his  tail,  like  a  horn ;  when %0a%3c punctured  with  which  he  is  still  more  irritated  by  the  pain."  This %0a%3c prickle  was  by  many  long  looked  upon  as  a  mere  fiction,  till  the  matter %0a%3c was  put  beyond  a  doubt,  some  years  since,  by  Professor  Blumenbach, %0a%3c who  upon  dissection  discovered  on  the  very  tip  of  the  tail  of  a  lioness  a %0a%3c small  dark-coloured  spine,  as  hard  as  a  piece  of  horn,  and  surrounded  at %0a%3c its  base  with  an  annular  fold  of  skin.  It  is,  however,  only  occasionally %0a%3c found ;  nor  is  it  confined  to  the  lion,  for  it  has  been  discovered  in  the %0a%3c Asiatic  leopard.  Mr.  Wood  ("  Zool.  Proc."  1832)  remarks  that  it  is  dif- %0a%3c ficult to  conjecture  the  use  of  these  prickles,  their  application  as  a  stimulus %0a%3c to  anger  being  of  course  out  of  the  question  ;  but  he  observes  that  it  could %0a%3c not  be  very  important,  for,  to  say  nothing  of  their  small  size  and  envelope- %0a%3c ment  in  the  fur,  the  majority  of  individuals,  in  consequence  of  the  readi- %0a%3c ness with  which  the  part  is  detached,  are  deprived  of  it  for  the  remainder %0a%3c of  their  lives.  The  writer  of  this  note  has  had  an  opportunity  of  seeing %0a%3c and  feeling  the  prickle  in  the  tail  of  a  lion's  cub,  which  was  whelped  in %0a%3c Womb  well's  menagerie.  —  Wern.

In  the  Beginning  of  his  Anger  he  beateth %0a%3c the  Ground,  when  it  increaseth  he  beateth  his  Sides  and %0a%3c Back  as  if  to  whip  himself  with  something  that  would  stir %0a%3c up  his  Fury.  His  main  Strength  lieth  in  his  Breast ;  from %0a%3c every  Wound,  whether  made  by  his  Claw  or  Tooth,  the %0a%3c Blood  that  floweth  is  Black.  When  their  Belly  is  full  they %0a%3c become  harmless.  His  Magnanimity  is  chiefly  shewn  in %0a%3c Dangers ;  not  only  in  that  he  despiseth  the  Darts,  but  also %0a%3c that  he  defendeth  himself  by  his  Terror  only,  and  as  if  bear- %0a%3c ing witness  that  he  is  forced  to  his  own  Defence,  he  riseth  up %0a%3c in  Fury,  not  as  at  last  compelled  by  the  Peril,  but  as  made %0a%3c angry  by  their  Folly.  But  this  more  noble  Display  of  Courage %0a%3c is  shewn  in  that,  however  great  may  be  the  Strength  of %0a%3c Hounds  and  Hunters,  while  in  the  open  Plains  and  where %0a%3c he  may  be  seen,  he  retireth  only  by  degrees  and  with  Scorn  ; %0a%3c but  when  he  hath  got  among  the  Thickets  and  Woods  then %0a%3c he  hurrieth  away,  as  if  the  Place  concealed  his  Shame. %0a%3c When  he  followeth  he  leapeth  with  a  Bound,  which  he  never %0a%3c useth  to  do  in  Flight.  If  wounded  he  hath  a  remarkable %0a%3c Quickness  of  Observation  to  discern  the  Person  who  smote %0a%3c him,  and  amidst  a  Multitude  he  runneth  upon  him  only.  As %0a%3c for  the  Man  who  hath  thrown  a  Dart  at  him  without  wound- %0a%3c ing him,  he  striketh  him  down,  and  seizeth  and  shaketh  him, %0a%3c but  doth  not  wound  him.  When  the  Female  fighteth  for  her %0a%3c Whelps,  it  is  said  that  she  fixeth  her  Gaze  upon  the  Ground, %0a%3c that  she  may  not  be  affrighted  at  the  Sight  of  the  hunting %0a%3c Weapons.

Q.  Sccevola,  the  Son  of  Publius, %0a%3c was  the  first  at  Rome  that,  in  his  Curule  .ZEdileship,  exhibited %0a%3c a  Fight  of  many  Lions  together;  but  L.  Sylla,  who  after- %0a%3c wards was  Dictator,  was  the  first  of  all  that  in  his  Praetor- %0a%3c ship  exhibited  an  hundred  maned  Lions.  After  him  Pompey %0a%3c the  Great  shewed  600  of  them  in  the  Circus,  and  among %0a%3c them  were  315  with  Manes.  Ccesar>  the  Dictator,  exhibited %0a%3c 400.  The  taking  of  them  formerly  was  a  hard  piece  of %0a%3c Work,  and  was  commonly  in  Pit-falls ;  but  in  the  Reign  of %0a%3c Claudius  a  Shepherd  of  Gsetulia  taught  the  manner  of  catch- %0a%3c ing them,  a  thing  to  be  regarded  as  almost  unbeseeming  the %0a%3c Name  of  such  a  Beast.  This  Gaetulian,  when  a  Lion  violently %0a%3c assailed  him,  threw  his  Military  Cloak  over  his  Eyes.  This %0a%3c remarkable  thing  was  soon  after  practised  in  the  Arena ;  so %0a%3c that  a  Man  would  hardly  have  believed  that  so  much  Fierce- %0a%3c ness should  so  easily  be  rendered  inert  by  this  slight  covering %0a%3c thrown  on  the  Head,  the  Creature  making  no  resistance,  but %0a%3c suffering  himself  to  be  bound  fast,  as  if  all  his  Vigour  rested %0a%3c in  his  Eyes.  The  less  therefore  is  it  to  be  wondered  at  that %0a%3c Lysimachus  strangled  a  Lion,1  when  by  Command  of  Alex- %0a%3c ander he  was  shut  up  alone  together  with  him.  The  first %0a%3c who  subdued  them  to  the  Yoke  at  Rome,  and  joined  them  to %0a%3c his  Chariot,  was  M.  Antony.  And  truly  it  was  in  the  Civil %0a%3c War,  when  the  Battle  was  still  in  Contest  in  the  Plains  of %0a%3c Pharsalia :  not  without  some  foretoken  of  the  times,  which %0a%3c by  that  Prodigy  gave  them  to  understand  that  Men  of  a %0a%3c high  Spirit  should  come  under  the  Yoke  of  Subjection ;  for %0a%3c that  Antony  was  carried  in  this  manner,  with  the  Comic %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Plutarch,  in  the  "  Life  of  Demetrius,"  informs  us  that  "  Demetrius %0a%3c having  sent  ambassadors  to  Lysimachus  on  some  occasion  or  other,  that %0a%3c prince  amused  himself  one  day  with  shewing  them  the  deep  wounds  he %0a%3c had  received  from  a  lion's  claws  in  his  arms  and  thighs,  and  gave  them  an %0a%3c account  of  his  being  shut  up  with  that  wild  beast  by  Alexander  the %0a%3c Great,  and  of  the  battle  he  had  with  it."

But  he  was  condemned %0a%3c on  account  of  this  very  Circumstance,  for  it  appeared  to  them %0a%3c that  a  Man  of  such  artful  Ingenuity  would  be  able  to  per- %0a%3c suade to  anything ;  and  that  it  was  dangerous  to  trust  their %0a%3c Liberty  to  him,  to  whom  even  Fierceness  itself  had  so  re- %0a%3c markably yielded.  But  there  are  also  casual  Examples  of %0a%3c their  Clemency.  Mentor,  the  Syracusan,  met  with  a  Lion %0a%3c in  Syria,  which  after  an  humble  manner  rolled  himself  in %0a%3c the  Way  before  him  ;  and  being  astonished  with  Fear,  when %0a%3c he  sought  to  escape  in  every  way  the  Wild  Beast  placed  him- %0a%3c self across  his  Path,  and  licked  his  Footsteps  in  a  flattering %0a%3c manner.  Mentor  then  observed  that  the  Lion  had  a  Swelling %0a%3c and  Wound  in  his  Foot,  whereupon  he  gently  plucked  out %0a%3c the  Splinters  of  Wood,  and  so  eased  the  Beast  of  his  Pain.1 %0a%3c This  Fact  is  for  a  Memorial  represented  in  a  Picture  at  Syra- %0a%3c cuse. In  a  similar  Manner  Elpis,  a  Samian  by  Nation,  being %0a%3c conveyed  to  Africa  in  a  Ship,  and  having  discovered  near  the %0a%3c Shore  a  Lion  having  a  threatening  Gape,  he  fled  quickly  to  a %0a%3c Tree,  and  called  upon  Father  Liber;  for  then  is  the  principal %0a%3c Time  for  Prayer,  when  we  see  no  other  Hope.  But  the  Lion %0a%3c stopped  him  not  in  his  Flight,  although  it  was  in  his  Power; %0a%3c and  laying  himself  down  close  to  the  Tree,  with  that  open %0a%3c Mouth  with  which  he  had  terrified  the  Man,  he  sought  his %0a%3c Compassion.  Now  the  Beast  having  lately  fed  greedily,  had %0a%3c gotten  a  Bone  stuck  fast  within  his  Teeth,  which  put  him  to %0a%3c great  Pain ;  also,  he  was  almost  famished  ;  and  he  looked %0a%3c up  pitifully,  shewing  how  he  was  punished  with  those  very %0a%3c Weapons  of  his,  and,  as  if  with  dumb  Prayers,  besought  his %0a%3c Help.  Eipis,  on  the  other  Hand,  not  being  very  forward  to %0a%3c commit  himself  to  the  Wild  Beast,  stayed  the  longer,  while %0a%3c he  considered  rather  this  miraculous  Accident  than  other- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  reader  will  here  be  reminded  of  the  well-known  story  of  An- %0a%3c drocles,  or  Androdus,  and  the  lion,  told  by  Aulus  Gellius  and  JElian. — %0a%3c Wern.

At  the  last  he  came  down  from  the %0a%3c Tree  and  plucked  out  the  Bone,  while  the  Lion  held  his %0a%3c Mouth  open,  and  composed  himself  to  his  Conveniency  :  in %0a%3c recompense  of  which  Service,  it  is  said,  that  so  long  as  this %0a%3c Ship  lay  on  that  Coast,  the  Lion  furnished  him  with  a  good %0a%3c Quantity  of  Food  by  Hunting.  And  on  this  account  Elpis %0a%3c dedicated  a  Temple  in  Samos  to  Liber  Pater;  which  from %0a%3c this  Circumstance  the  Greeks  called  jt.s^v6rog  A/ovutfou  (of %0a%3c Gaping  Dionysius}.'1  Can  we  feel  surprised  after  this,  that %0a%3c Wild  Beasts  should  know  the  Footsteps  of  Men,2  when  even %0a%3c they  have  recourse  to  him  alone  for  Hope  of  Succour?  And %0a%3c why  did  they  not  go  to  other  Creatures?  or  who  taught %0a%3c them  that  the  Hand  of  Man  was  ahle  to  cure  them  ?  unless %0a%3c this  be  the  Reason,  that  perhaps  the  Power  of  many  Evils %0a%3c forceth  even  savage  Beasts  to  seek  out  all  means  of  Help. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVII. %0a%3c Of  Panthers. %0a%3c %0a%3c DEMETRIUS  the  Natural  Philosopher  also  maketh %0a%3c mention  of  as  memorable  a  Case  as  the  former,  concerning  a %0a%3c Panther;  which  was  desirous  to  meet  with  a  Man,  and %0a%3c therefore  lay  in  the  Middle  of  an  Highway,  and  suddenly %0a%3c appeared  to  the  Father  of  a  certain  Philinus,  a  Student  of %0a%3c Philosophy.  The  Man,  through  Fear,  began  to  go  back %0a%3c again,  but  the  Wild  Beast  kept  rolling  itself  about  him,  very %0a%3c plainly  fawning  upon  him,  and  tossing  itself  so  piteously, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Holland  has  chosen  to  add,  "  or  ^ar^os  vuov  AIOVVO-OV,  the  Chapel  of %0a%3c Dionysius  the  Saviour  ;"  not  because  there  are  such  words  in  the  text, %0a%3c but  because  Gesner,  whose  edition  of  Pliny  he  appears  to  have  used,  not %0a%3c understanding  the  purport  of  Pliny's  words,  has  proposed  to  substitute %0a%3c the  latter,  which  he  supposed  to  be  a  more  intelligible  reading.

She  had  but %0a%3c lately  produced  Young,  and  her  Whelps  were  fallen  into  a %0a%3c Pit  at  a  Distance  off.  The  first  Point  of  Pity  that  the  Man %0a%3c shewed  was  not  to  be  afraid ;  and  the  next,  to  direct  his %0a%3c Regard  to  her ;  and  so  following  her  in  the  Way  whither  she %0a%3c drew  him  by  his  Garment,  which  she  gently  held  with  her %0a%3c Claws,  as  he  understood  the  Occasion  of  her  Sorrow,  and  the %0a%3c Reward  of  his  Courtesy,  he  drew  forth  her  little  ones  ;  which %0a%3c done,  she  and  her  Whelps,  leaping  for  Joy,  accompanied  him, %0a%3c and  directed  him  all  the  Way  to  beyond  the  Wilderness. %0a%3c So  that  it  easily  could  be  discerned  that  she  was  thankful %0a%3c to  him,  and  that  they  mutually  acknowledged  each  other: %0a%3c a  rare  Example  to  be  found  even  amongst  Men.  This  Story %0a%3c gives  great  Credit  to  that  which  Democritus  reporteth :  That %0a%3c Thoas,  in  Arcadia,  was  preserved  by  a  Dragon.  This  Thoas, %0a%3c when  a  Child,  had  loved  this  Dragon  exceedingly  well,  and %0a%3c nourished  him ;  but  being  in  some  dread  of  the  Serpent's %0a%3c Nature,  and  fearing  his  Magnitude,  he  had  carried  him  into %0a%3c the  Deserts ;  wherein  being  environed  by  the  Stratagems  of %0a%3c Thieves,  when  he  cried  out,  the  Dragon,  knowing  his  voice, %0a%3c came  forth  and  rescued  him.  As  for  the  Things  reported %0a%3c concerning  Infants  cast  forth  to  perish,  and  sustained  by  the %0a%3c Milk  of  Wild  Beasts,  like  Romulus  and  Remus,  our  Founders, %0a%3c by  a  She-Wolf,  in  my  Opinion  they  are  to  be  attributed  more %0a%3c to  the  Greatness  of  their  Destinies  than  to  the  Nature  of  those %0a%3c Wild  Beasts.  Panthers  and  Tigers  are  almost  the  only  Beasts %0a%3c seen  with  a  Variety  of  Spots ;  for  other  Beasts  have  each  one %0a%3c a  proper  Colour  of  their  own,  according  to  their  Kind.  A %0a%3c black  Kind  of  Lion  is  found  in  Syria  only.  The  Ground  of %0a%3c the  Panther's  Skin  is  White,1  with  little  black  Spots  like %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  There  seems  much  uncertainty  and  confusion  in  Pliny's  description %0a%3c of  the  Panther  and  Leopard,  which,  probably,  he  means  by  the  terms %0a%3c Panthera  and  Pardvs ;  indeed,  modern  naturalists  are  not  at  all  agreed  as %0a%3c to  the  best  mode  of  distinguishing  these  animals.  Cuvier  considers  the %0a%3c v  vK$K*.ts  of  the  ancients  to  be  the  modern  Panther  (Felis  Pardus. — LINN.). %0a%3c He  does  not  notice  the  Panther,  o  vnvfa*  of  Aristotle,  "  Hist.

It  is  said  that  all  Quadrupeds  are  wonderfully  enticed %0a%3c by  the  Smell  of  Panthers ;  but  their  Sternness  of  Counte- %0a%3c nance carrieth  Terror  with  it,  and  therefore  they  hide  their %0a%3c Heads,  and  when  they  have  attracted  other  Beasts  within %0a%3c reach  by  their  sweet  Smell,  they  fly  upon  and  seize  them. %0a%3c Some  report  that  they  have  a  Mark  on  their  Shoulder  resem- %0a%3c bling the  Moon,  growing  to  the  full  and  decreasing  into %0a%3c Horns  as  she  doth.  In  all  this  Race  of  Wild  Beasts,  now  they %0a%3c call  the  Males  Varise  and  Pardi ;  and  there  is  great  Abun- %0a%3c dance of  them  in  Africa  and  Syria.  Some  distinguish  be- %0a%3c tween Leopards  and  Panthers,  by  the  Panthers  being  white ; %0a%3c and  as  yet  I  know  no  other  Difference  between  them.  There %0a%3c was  an  old  Act  of  the  Senate,  forbidding  that  any  Panthers %0a%3c of  Africa  should  be  brought  into  Italy.  Against  this  Edict, %0a%3c Cn.  Aufidius,  a  Tribune  of  the  People,  produced  a  Bill  to  the %0a%3c People,  which  permitted,  that  for  the  sake  of  the  Circensian %0a%3c Games,  they  might  be  brought  over.

Their  Swiftness  is  comparable  to  that  of  Horses ; %0a%3c but  they  differ  one  from  another  in  this,  as  they  do  also  in %0a%3c Strength.

Naturally  they  hate  Horses.1  They %0a%3c can  sustain  Thirst  for  four  Days  together;  and  when  they %0a%3c find  Occasion  to  drink,  they  fill  themselves  full  enough  to %0a%3c serve  both  for  the  Past  and  Future ;  but  before  they  drink, %0a%3c they  trample  with  their  Feet  to  trouble  the  Water,  for  other- %0a%3c wise they  take  no  Pleasure  in  drinking.  They  live  for  fifty %0a%3c Years,  and  some  of  them  an  hundred.  These  Creatures,  also, %0a%3c as  it  were,  fall  to  be  mad.  Also  a  Method  hath  been  disco- %0a%3c vered of  castrating  the  very  Females,  to  make  them  service- %0a%3c able in  War  ;  for  if  the  sexual  Disposition  be  denied  to  them, %0a%3c they  become  stronger. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  are  two  other  Kinds  of  Beasts2  which  resemble  in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  a  state  of  nature  this  appears  to  be  the  case ;  while  at  Smyrna, %0a%3c and  other  parts  of  Asia,  the  horse  and  camel  are  constantly  seen,  each %0a%3c occupied  in  its  respective  labours,  in  friendly  harmony  ;  this  may,  indeed, %0a%3c be  only  the  effect  of  hereditary  habit,  the  animals  having  been  so  long %0a%3c accustomed  to  each  other;  for  at  Pisa,  where  the  camel  has  been  intro- %0a%3c duced not  much  more  than  two  centuries,  we  are  informed  by  Professor %0a%3c Santi,  that  it  is  necessary  to  accustom  the  horses  of  the  neighbourhood  to %0a%3c the  sight  of  the  camel,  as  without  such  precaution   constant  accidents %0a%3c would  occur.    And  Herodotus  relates  (Clio,  80),  that  when  Cyrus  met %0a%3c the  Lydian  army,  commanded  by  Croesus,  fearing  the   cavalry  of  his %0a%3c enemy,  he  unloaded  the  baggage  camels,  and  placed  soldiers  upon  them, %0a%3c with  orders  to  march  against  the  enemy's  cavalry ;  this  he  did,  as  Hero- %0a%3c dotus says,  because  "  the  horse  has  a  dread  of  the  camel,  and  cannot  bear %0a%3c either  to  see  the  form,  or  to  smell  the  scent  of  him."     And  the  stratagem %0a%3c of  Cyrus  succeeded,  for  the  horses  no  sooner  saw  and  smelt  the  camels, %0a%3c than  they  turned  back,  and  the  hopes  of  Croesus  were  destroyed.— Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  Pliny,  in  the  original,  implies  that  there  are  two  other  kinds  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  35 %0a%3c %0a%3c some  sort  the  Camel :  one  of  them  is  called  by  the  Ethiopians, %0a%3c the  Nabis ;  with  a  Neck  like  a  Horse,  and  the  Leg  and  Foot %0a%3c like  the  Ox ;  the  Head  resembles  that  of  a  Camel,  and  it  is %0a%3c marked  with  white  Spots  upon  a  red  Ground,  from  which  it %0a%3c taketh  the  Name  of  Camelopardalis  ; 1  and  the  first  Time  it %0a%3c was  seen  at  Rome  was  in  the  Games  of  the  Circus  given  by %0a%3c Ccesar  the  Dictator;  since  which  Time  it  is  sometimes  seen, %0a%3c being  more  remarkable  for  the  Sight  than  for  any  wild  Nature %0a%3c that  it  hath  ;  on  which  Account  some  have  given  it  the  Name %0a%3c of  the  Wild  Sheep. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIX. %0a%3c Of  the  Chaus  and  Cephus. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Chaus,2  which  the  Gauls  called  Rhaphius,  having %0a%3c the  Shape  of  a  Wolf  with  Leopard's  Spots,  was  shewed  first %0a%3c in  the  Plays  exhibited  by  Pompey  the  Great.

It  is  received  for  a  Truth, %0a%3c that  one  of  them  being  killed  with  a  Larice  by  a  Man  on %0a%3c %0a%3c Ann  say,  in  answer  to  Richard's  observation  on  her  eyes :  "  Would  they %0a%3c were  basilisk's,  to  strike  thee  dead ! "  Its  touch  was  also  said  to  cause  the %0a%3c flesh  to  fall  from  the  bones  of  the  animal  with  which  it  came  in  contact. %0a%3c The  Basilisk  was  a  wingless  dragon,  and  derived  its  name  from  bearing  on %0a%3c its  head  the  figure  of  a  crown.  The  Egyptians  believed  it  was  produced %0a%3c from  the  egg  of  the  ibis,  and  some,  more  modern,  from  the  egg  of  the %0a%3c common  cock  ;  and,  strange  as  it  may  appear,  the  latter  supposition  may %0a%3c explain  much  of  the  superstition  regarding  it.  It  is  now  known  that, %0a%3c from  some  change  in  the  structure  and  action  of  the  ovary,  a  hen  some- %0a%3c times assumes  the  plumage  of  a  cock ;  as  is  the  case  also  with  other  galli- %0a%3c naceous fowls,  and  even  the  duck.  The  final  result  is  barrenness ;  but %0a%3c previous  to  this  an  egg  may  be  produced,  that  is  unnatural  in  its  size  and %0a%3c contents ;  and  such  a  one  is  figured  by  Aldrovandus,  and  copied  from %0a%3c him  by  Ruysch  (Table  of  Serpents,  X.).  Such  an  egg  resembles  the %0a%3c produce  of  some  serpents,  and  the  latter  might  be  easily  mistaken  for  the %0a%3c former.  The  egg  of  a  snake  may  be  often  found  on  a  dung-heap,  over %0a%3c which  a  fowl  may  roost ;  and  an  individual  who  had  seen  an  egg  from %0a%3c such  a  transformed  fowl,  might  mistake  a  snake's  egg  for  it,  and  watch  it %0a%3c to  its  hatching.  Hens  also  sometimes  lay  soft  eggs  (without  a  shell),  and %0a%3c when  they  do  so,  as  wanting  the  firmness  natural  to  it,  the  egg  escapes %0a%3c from  them  when  on  the  perch,  without  the  consciousness  of  laying.  The %0a%3c Editor  has  known  such  eggs  to  fall  on  the  dungheap  below ;  and  when %0a%3c so,  it  would  not  be  easy  to  distinguish  them  from  those  laid  by  snakes  in %0a%3c the  same  place.  An  egg  so  laid  produces  nothing  living ;  but  the  uncer- %0a%3c tainty attending  it,  especially  if  laid  by  a  hen  in  a  condition  of  trans- %0a%3c formed plumage,  in  the  same  place  with  those  deposited  by  a  snake,  would %0a%3c be  a  sufficient  foundation  for  all  the  superstition  attending  it.  The  eggs %0a%3c of  the  Basilisk,  and  their  liability  to  be  mistaken  for  those  which  were %0a%3c wholesome,  are  referred  to  by  the  prophet  Isaiah,  lix.  5.  Ruysch %0a%3c thinks  that  the  cobra  da  capella,  or  hooded  snake,  is  one  of  the  ser- %0a%3c pents that  have  been  called  the  Basilisk,  or  the  royal  serpent. — Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c History  of  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [BOOK  VIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Horseback,  the  Poison  was  so  strong  that  it  passed  along %0a%3c the  Staff,  and  destroyed  both  Horse  and  Man  ;  and  yet  a %0a%3c Weasel  hath  a  deadly  Power  to  kill  even  such  a  Monster  as %0a%3c this  (for  Kings  have  been  desirous  to  see  the  Manner  how  he %0a%3c %0a%3c is  killed).

That  Men  are  transformed  into  Wolves, %0a%3c and  restored  again  to  their  former  Shapes,  we  must  confi- %0a%3c dently believe  to  be  False,  or  else  give  credit  to  all  those %0a%3c Tales  which  we  have  for  so  many  ages  found  to  be  mere %0a%3c Fables.  But  whence  this  Opinion  came  to  be  so  firmly %0a%3c settled,  that  when  we  would  give  Men  the  most  opprobrious %0a%3c Words,  we  term  them  Versipelles,  or  Turn-coats,  I  will  shew. %0a%3c Euanthes,  a  not  contemptible  Writer  among  the  Greeks,  re- %0a%3c porteth  having  found  among  the  Records  of  the  Arcadians %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Canis  Lupus.— LINN.

Fabius  addeth  one  thing %0a%3c more,  that  he  findeth  again  the  same  Garment.  It  is  won- %0a%3c derful to  what  extent  Grecian  Credulity  can  proceed  ;  so  that %0a%3c there  is  not  so  impudent  a  Lie  but  it  findeth  some  one  to %0a%3c bear  Witness  to  it.  And  therefore  Agriopas,  who  wrote  the %0a%3c Olympionicse,  telleth  of  one  Dcemcenetus  Parrhasius,  who  at  a %0a%3c Sacrifice  of  a  Human  Being,  which  the  Arcadians  celebrated %0a%3c to  Jupiter  Lyccens,  tasted  of  the  Inwards  of  a  Boy,  and  was %0a%3c turned  into  a  Wolf;  and  the  same  Man  ten  Years  after  was %0a%3c changed  to  a  Man  again,  became  a  Wrestler,  contended  in %0a%3c Boxing,  and  went  away  home  again  with  Victory  from %0a%3c Olympia.  Besides,  it  is  commonly  believed  that  in  the %0a%3c Tail  of  this  Animal  there  is  a  little  Hair  that  is  effectual  to %0a%3c procure  Love  ;  and  that  when  he  is  taken  he  casteth  it  away, %0a%3c because  it  is  of  no  Force  unless  it  is  taken  from  him  while %0a%3c he  is  Alive.  He  goeth  to  rut  in  the  whole  Year  no  more %0a%3c than  twelve  Days.  When  he  is  very  hungry  he  devoureth %0a%3c Earth.  Among  Auguries,  if  a  Wolf,  in  going  about,  turn  to %0a%3c their  Right  Hand,  with  the  Interruption  of  his  Journey,  it  is %0a%3c good ;  but  if  his  Mouth  be  full  when  he  doth  so,  there  is %0a%3c not  a  better  Sign  in  the  World.  There  are  some  of  this %0a%3c Kind  that  are  called  Stag- Wolves,1  such  as  we  have  said %0a%3c that  Pompey  shewed  in  the  Circus,  brought  out  of  Gallia. %0a%3c This  Animal,  they  say,  however  hungry  he  may  be  when %0a%3c he  is  eating,  if  he  chance  to  look  backward,  forgetteth  his %0a%3c Meat,  and  wandereth  away  to  seek  for  some  other  Prey. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Lib.  viii.  c,  19.—  Wern.

The  Cerastes1  hath  standing  out  on  the %0a%3c Body  some  small  Horns,  which  are  often  four  Double ; %0a%3c by  moving  which,  while  the  rest  of  the  Body  is  hidden, %0a%3c she  enticeth  the  Birds  into  her  Power. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Amphisbsena  hath  two  Heads,2  that  is  to  say,  one  at %0a%3c the  Head  and  another  at  the  Tail,  as  if  it  were  little  to  cast %0a%3c out  her  Poison  at  one  Mouth  only.  Some  have  Scales, %0a%3c others  are  painted ;  but  all  have  deadly  Venom.  The %0a%3c Jaculus  darteth  itself  from  the  Boughs  of  Trees :  so  that %0a%3c we  are  not  only  to  guard  against  Serpents  with  our  Feet, %0a%3c but  also  to  look  to  them  that  fly  as  a  Dart  from  an  Engine. %0a%3c The  Aspides  swell  about  the  Neck3  (when  they  purpose  to %0a%3c sting);  and  there  is  no  Remedy  for  the  Bite  unless  the %0a%3c Parts  that  are  wounded  are  cut  off  immediately.  This %0a%3c destructive  Creature  hath  one  Point  yet  of  Understanding, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Vipera  (Cerastes")  caudalis. — SMITH.  Near  the  middle  of  each  of %0a%3c the  arched  eyebrows  of  this  venomous  snake  there  is  a  slender,  pointed, %0a%3c slightly  recurved  spine,  about  a  line,  or  a  line  and  a  quarter  in  length. %0a%3c This  in  part  answering  the  description  of  Pliny,  renders  it  not  improbable %0a%3c that  it  is  the  reptile  intended  by  our  author.  It  inhabits  the  dry  sandy %0a%3c districts  of  Africa.

From  various  circumstances, %0a%3c however,  and  particularly  from  the  description  of  Pliny,  it  is  evident  that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  45 %0a%3c %0a%3c or  rather  of  Affection  :  they  for  the  most  part  wander  abroad %0a%3c in  Pairs ;  nor  can  they  live  without  their  Mate :  so  that  if %0a%3c one  be  killed,  it  is  incredible  how  the  other  seeketh  to  be %0a%3c revenged.  It  pursueth  the  Murderer;  it  knoweth  him %0a%3c again  amongst  a  great  number  of  People,  and  followeth  him %0a%3c closely ;  it  overcometh  all  Difficulties,  goeth  to  any  Dis- %0a%3c tance, and  nothing  will  save  him  unless  it  is  stopped  by  some %0a%3c River,  or  that  the  Individual  betake  himself  to  a  hasty %0a%3c Flight.  I  am  not  able  to  say  whether  Nature  hath  been %0a%3c more  free  in  producing  such  Evils,  or  in  giving  us  Remedies. %0a%3c For,  in  the  first  place,  she  hath  afforded  to  this  hurtful %0a%3c Creature  but  a  dim  Pair  of  Eyes,  and  those  not  placed  in  the %0a%3c fore  Part  of  the  Head,  to  see  directly  forward,  but  in  the %0a%3c Temples.

This  Animal  alone,  of  all  other  that  live  on  the %0a%3c Land,  hath  no  use  of  a  Tongue.  He  only  moveth  the %0a%3c upper  Jaw,  with  which  he  biteth  hard  ;  and  the  grasp  of %0a%3c his  Mouth  is  otherwise  terrible,  by  means  of  the  row  of  his %0a%3c Teeth,  which  close  within  one  another  as  if  two  Combs %0a%3c penetrated  each  other.  Ordinarily  he  is  above  eighteen %0a%3c Cubits  in  Length.  The  Female  layeth  Eggs  as  big  as  those %0a%3c of  a  Goose,  and  sitteth  continually  upon  them  out  of  the %0a%3c Water.  By  a  certain  Fore-knowledge  she  is  aware  how  far %0a%3c the  Nile  will  rise  that  Year  when  it  is  at  the  highest.  There %0a%3c is  no  other  Creature  that  from  a  smaller  Beginning  groweth %0a%3c to  a  greater  Size.  He  is  armed  with  Claws,  and  his  Skin %0a%3c will  resist  any  Injury  whatever.  By  Day  it  keepeth  on  the %0a%3c Land,  but  passeth  the  Night  in  the  Water  ;  being  guided  by %0a%3c each  according  to  the  Season.  When  it  hath  satisfied  its %0a%3c Appetite  with  Fishes,  it  lieth  asleep  on  the  Shore,  and %0a%3c always  with  some  of  the  Meat  in  his  Mouth.  Then  cometh %0a%3c a  little  Bird,  called  there  Trochilos,2  and  in  Italy  the  King  of %0a%3c Birds,  and  for  the  sake  of  her  Food  she  instigates  the  Crea- %0a%3c ture to  gape  by  hopping  first  about  its  Mouth,  which  she %0a%3c pecks  and  cleanses,  and  then  the  Teeth,  after  which  she %0a%3c getteth  within  to  the  Back  of  his  Mouth,  which  it  openeth %0a%3c the  wider  because  it  taketh  such  great  Delight  in  this %0a%3c scouring.

Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  This  account  is  taken  from  Herodotus  (Euterpe,  Ixviii.)  who  says, %0a%3c "  The  mouth  of  the  crocodile  is  filled  in  the  inside  with  leeches.    All %0a%3c birds  and  animals  in  general  avoid  him ;  the  trochilus  is  the  only  animal %0a%3c at  peace  with  him  ;  and  that  on  account  of  the  services  he  receives  from %0a%3c that  bird ;  for  when  the  crocodile  comes  out  of  the  water  to  land,  and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%3c %0a%3c this  Pleasure,  the  Ichneumon,  having  discovered  the  Oppor- %0a%3c tunity, shooteth  himself  down  his  Throat  like  a  Dart,  and %0a%3c gnaweth  a  Hole  through  his  Belly.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c In  the  Nilus  there  breeds  also  the  Scincos,2  which  is  like %0a%3c the  Crocodile,  but  less  than  the  Ichneumon.  It  is  the  chief %0a%3c Antidote  against  Poisons,  and  also  provokes  the  Heat  of %0a%3c Lust  in  Men. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  the  Crocodile  produceth  so  much  Mischief,  that %0a%3c Nature  is  not  content  to  have  given  him  only  one  Enemy; %0a%3c %0a%3c opens  his  mouth,  the  trochilus  goes  into  his  throat  and  devours  the %0a%3c leeches :  the  crocodile  is  pleased  at  being  relieved,  and  hurts  not  the %0a%3c trochilus."  Although  this  statement  is  confirmed  by  Aristotle,  Pliny, %0a%3c and  other  ancient  writers,  it  has  been  very  generally  discredited  in %0a%3c modern  times.  Recent  inquiries,  however,  shew  that  in  this,  as  in  most %0a%3c of  his  relations,  the  father  of  history  is  justified  by  the  fact.  The  term %0a%3c "bdella"  has  hitherto  been  translated  "  leech."  But  M.  Geoffrey  St. %0a%3c Hilaire  has  adopted  the  opinion  that  it  corresponds  to  "culex,"  that  is, %0a%3c "  a  gnat,"  myriads  of  which  insects  swarm  on  the  banks  of  the  Nile,  and %0a%3c attack  the  crocodile  when  he  comes  to  repose  on  the  sand.  His  mouth %0a%3c is  not  so  hermetically  closed  but  that  they  can  enter,  which  they  do  in %0a%3c such  numbers,  that  the  interior  of  his  palate,  which  is  naturally  of  a %0a%3c bright  yellow,  appears  covered  with  a  darkish  brown  crust.  The  insects %0a%3c strike  their  trunks  into  the  orifices  of  the  glands  which  abound  in  the %0a%3c mouth  of  the  crocodile ;  and  the  tongue  of  the  animal  being  immoveable, %0a%3c it  cannot  get  rid  of  them.  It  is  then  that  the  trochilus,  a  kind  of  plover, %0a%3c closely  allied  to  the  Charadrius  minor  of  Meyer,  or  in  the  opinion  of  M. %0a%3c St.  Hilaire,  C.  Egyptiacus,  but  which  Pliny,  confounding  with  another %0a%3c bird  of  the  same  name,  calls  "  the  king  of  birds,"  in  its  pursuit  of  the %0a%3c gnats,  hastens  to  his  relief ;  the  crocodile  always  taking  care,  when  he  is %0a%3c about  to  shut  his  mouth,  to  make  certain  movements  which  warn  the %0a%3c bird  to  fly  away.  Thus  the  ancient  story  is  not  so  unreasonable  as  might %0a%3c be  thought.  It  is  matter  of  every-day  observation,  that  gnats  will  attack %0a%3c bulls  and  other  large  terrestrial  animals  of  the  fiercest  nature ;  and  that %0a%3c wagtails  and  other  insectivorous  birds  will  peck  the  former  from  their %0a%3c muzzles.  While  in  India  it  is  common  to  see  the  ox  approaching  its  eye %0a%3c deliberately  to  the  ground,  by  holding  its  head  on  one  side,  to  enable  the %0a%3c mina,  a  species  of  starling,  to  take  an  insect  from  the  hairs  of  the  eyelid. %0a%3c There  appears,  therefore,  no  reason  why  the  crocodile  should  not  have %0a%3c recourse  to  similar  aid  on  similar  necessity. —  Wern.

Also, %0a%3c there  is  a  Kind  of  People  that  bear  a  Hatred  to  the  Croco- %0a%3c dile, and  they  are  called  Tentyrites,  from  an  Island  of  the %0a%3c Nile  which  they  inhabit.  These  Men  are  of  small  Stature, %0a%3c but  when  opposed  against  the  Crocodiles,  and  then  only,  it  is %0a%3c wonderful  to  see  how  resolute  they  are.  Indeed  this  Cro- %0a%3c codile is  a  terrible  Beast  to  them  who  fly  from  him  ;  but  on %0a%3c the  other  Hand  he  runneth  away  from  such  as  pursue  him. %0a%3c Now,  these  People  are  the  only  Men  that  dare  to  approach %0a%3c right  in  front  of  him.

A  ride  on  the  back  of  a  crocodile  does  not  seem  a  very  tempting %0a%3c thing ;  but  that  it  has  long  been  occasionally  performed  in  the  process  of %0a%3c killing  these  monsters  is  shewn  by  Dr.  Pocock,  in  his  "  Observations  on %0a%3c Egypt,"  where  he  says,  "  They  make  some  animal  cry  at  a  distance  from %0a%3c the  river,  and  when  the  crocodile  comes  out  they  thrust  a  spear  into  his %0a%3c body,  to  which  a  rope  is  tied :  they  then  let  him  go  into  the  water  to %0a%3c spend  himself,  and  afterwards  drawing  him  out,  run  a  pole  into  his %0a%3c mouth,  and,  jumping  on  his  back,  tie  his  jaws  together."—  (Vol.  i.  p.  203.) %0a%3c Mr.  Waterton,  in  his  "Wanderings  in  South  America,"  tells  us  he  per- %0a%3c formed  the  same  extraordinary  feat.      His  Indian  assistants  having %0a%3c secured  a  monster  of  the  Essequibo,  by  a  baited  hook  fastened  to  a  long %0a%3c pole,  "they  pulled  the  cayman,"  as  he  describes  (p.  231,)  "within  two %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%3c %0a%3c like  Horsemen ;  and  as  they  turn  up  their  Heads,  with  their %0a%3c Mouth  wide  open  to  bite,  they  thrust  a  Club  into  it  across, %0a%3c and  so  holding  with  the  Hands  each  End  of  it,  the  one  with %0a%3c the  right  and  the  other  with  the  left  as  with  a  Bridle, %0a%3c they  bring  them  Prisoners  to  land ;  and  then,  when  they %0a%3c have  them  there,  they  so  frighten  them  with  their  Voice %0a%3c only,  that  they  compel  them  to  vomit  up  those  Bodies  which %0a%3c they  have  newly  swallowed,  and  bury  them.  And  therefore %0a%3c this  is  the  only  Island  which  the  Crocodiles  will  not  swim %0a%3c to ;  for  the  very  Smell  of  these  Tentyrites  drives  them %0a%3c away,  just  as  the  Psylli1  do  with  Serpents.  This  Animal %0a%3c is  said  to  see  but  badly  in  the  Water ;  but  out  of  it  they  are %0a%3c very  quick-sighted.  The  four  Winter  Months  they  pass  in  a %0a%3c Cave,  and  eat  nothing.  Some  are  of  Opinion,  that  this  is  the %0a%3c only  Creature  that  groweth  as  long  as  he  liveth  ;  and  certainly %0a%3c he  liveth  a  long  Time. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The  same  River  Nile  produceth  another  Beast  of  greater %0a%3c Height,  called  Hippopotamus.2  He  hath  a  cloven  Foot  like %0a%3c an  Ox  ;  the  Back,  Mane,  and  Neighing  of  an  Horse ;  his %0a%3c Snout  turning  up.  The  Tail  and  hooked  Teeth  are  like  those %0a%3c of  Boars,  but  less  formidable ;  the  Skin  of  his  Back  impene- %0a%3c %0a%3c yards  of  me ;  I  saw  he  was  in  a  state  of  fear  and  perturbation  ;  I  instantly %0a%3c dropped  the  mast,  sprang  up,  and  jumped  on  his  back,  turning  half  round %0a%3c as  I  vaulted,  so  that  I  gained  my  seat  with  my  face  in  a  right  position.  I %0a%3c immediately  seized  his  fore  legs,  and  by  main  force  twisted  them  on  his %0a%3c back  :  thus  they  served  me  for  a  bridle." — Wern.

For  finding  himelf  overfat,  by %0a%3c Reason  of  his  full  Feeding  so  continually,  he  getteth  to  the %0a%3c Shore,  having  spied  where  the  Reeds  have  been  newly  cut ; %0a%3c and  where  he  seeth  the  sharpest.  Stem  he  presseth  down  his %0a%3c Body  on  it,  and  pierceth  a  certain  Vein  in  his  Leg,  so  that %0a%3c by  a  Flow  of  Blood  he  relieves  his  diseased  Body,  and  he %0a%3c covereth  over  the  Orifice  again  with  Mud. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c What  Herbs  certain  Creatures  have  showed  us:  Deer,  Lizards, %0a%3c Swallows,  Tortoises,  the  Weasel,  Stork,  the  Boar,  the %0a%3c Snake,  Dragon,  Panther, Elephant, Bears,  Doves,  Pigeons, %0a%3c Cranes,  the  Raven. %0a%3c %0a%3c SOMETHING  like  this  was  showed  us  by  a  Bird  which  is %0a%3c called  Ibis  in  the  same  Country  of  Egypt.  This  Bird  having %0a%3c %0a%3c potamus  at  Rome,  can  hardly  be  supposed  to  have  seen  it,  or  he  never %0a%3c could  have  fallen  into  so  great  an  error  as  to  give  it  the  mane  of  an %0a%3c horse.  It  need  hardly  be  observed,  that  in  all  probability  the  Romans %0a%3c derived  their  Hippopotamus  from  Northern  Africa ;  if,  therefore,  there  be %0a%3c more  than  one  species,  the  Hippopotamus  Senegalensis  is,  in  all  likelihood, %0a%3c the  one  intended.  —  Went.

In  Gallia,  the %0a%3c Inhabitants  of  one  City  were  driven  out  by  Frogs.  In  Africa, %0a%3c the  People  were  expelled  by  Locusts.  Out  of  Gyaros,1  an %0a%3c Island  of  the  Cyclades,  the  Inhabitants  were  driven  away  by %0a%3c Rats  and  Mice.  In  Italy,  Amyclae  was  destroyed  by  Ser- %0a%3c pents.

Also  that  he  will  imitate %0a%3c the  Vomiting  of  a  Man,  to  entice  the  Dogs  to  come  to  him, %0a%3c and  then  devour  them.  This  Beast  alone  will  dig  up  the %0a%3c Graves  in  search  of  Bodies.  The  Female  is  seldom  taken. %0a%3c There  are  a  thousand  Variations  in  their  Eyes,  through  the %0a%3c change  of  Colour.  Moreover,  if  a  Dog  come  within  his %0a%3c Shadow,  he  becometh  dumb.  Again,  by  certain  magical %0a%3c Arts,  if  he  go  round  about  any  other  living  Creature  three %0a%3c Times,  it  shall  not  have  the  Power  to  stir  a  Foot.  The %0a%3c Lioness  of  Ethiopia,  by  Copulation  with  this  kind,  brings %0a%3c forth  the  Leocrocuta  j1  which  likewise  knoweth  how  to  imi- %0a%3c tate the  Voice  both  of  Man  and  the  Sheep.

Many  Hyaenas  are  produced  in %0a%3c Africa;  which  also  yieldeth  a  Multitude  of  wild  Asses.3 %0a%3c And  one  of  the  Males  ruleth  whole  Flocks  of  the  female %0a%3c Asses.  These  Beasts  are  so  jealous,  that  they  look  narrowly %0a%3c to  the  Females  great  with  young;  and  as  soon  as  they  have %0a%3c foaled,  they  castrate  the  young  Males.  On  the  other  Hand, %0a%3c the  she-Asses,  when  they  are  with  young,  seek  hiding- %0a%3c places,  from  a  Desire  to  bring  forth  secretly;  and  they  delight %0a%3c in  the  Abundance  of  their  Gratification. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Beavers  in  Pontus  4  do  the  same  as  the  male  Asses, %0a%3c by  the  same  Parts,  when  Danger  presses ;  as  knowing  that %0a%3c they  are  sought  after  for  this ;  and  these  Parts  Physicians %0a%3c call  Castoreum.

Finding  themselves  with  Young,  they %0a%3c part  Company  with  the  Stags.  But  the  Males,  seeing  them- %0a%3c selves left,  fall  into  the  Rage  of  Heat,  and  dig  Pits  in  the %0a%3c Ground.  Then  their  Muzzles  become  black,  and  so  con- %0a%3c tinue, until  such  Time  as  the  Rain  washeth  away  the  Colour. %0a%3c The  Hinds,  before  they  calve,  purge  themselves  with  the %0a%3c Herb  called  Seselis,1  whereby  they  have  more  easy  Deliver- %0a%3c ance. After  Parturition  they  have  two  Herbs,  which  are  called %0a%3c Arus2  and  Seselis,  after  having  eaten  of  which  they  return %0a%3c to  their  Young,  being  willing,  for  some  unknown  Reason, %0a%3c that  their  first  Milk  should  taste  of  these  Herbs.

They  lead  them  to  high  and %0a%3c craggy  Rocks,  and  show  them  how  to  leap.  And  now  the %0a%3c Stags  being  past  the  Heat  of  Rut,  fall  eagerly  to  their  Food. %0a%3c When  they  find  themselves  to  be  grown  very  Fat,  they  seek %0a%3c Lurking-places,  confessing  how  incommodious  their  Weight %0a%3c is  to  them.  At  other  Times  always  they  delight  in  flight ;  and %0a%3c stand  still  to  look  behind.  But  when  the  Hunters  are  come %0a%3c near  them,  then  they  seek  the  Shelter  of  Flight  again ;  and %0a%3c this  they  do  for  a  Pain  in  their  Bowels,  which  Parts  are  so %0a%3c tender,  that  with  a  slight  Blow  they  will  burst  within.

The  Males  possess  Horns,  and  are  the  only  Animals %0a%3c that  cast  them  every  Year  at  a  certain  Time  of  the  Spring  : %0a%3c and  to  that  Purpose,  a  little  before  the  very  Day,  they  seek %0a%3c the  most  secret  Places.

It %0a%3c is  denied  that  the  Right  Horn  can  ever  be  found,  as  being %0a%3c endued  with  some  singular  Virtue  as  a  Medicine ;  and  this %0a%3c must  be  granted  to  be  a  very  wonderful  Thing,  considering %0a%3c that  in  Parks1  they  change  them  every  Year;  so  that  it  is %0a%3c thought  they  bury  them  in  the  Earth.     But  burn  which  of %0a%3c them  you  will,  the  Smell  of  it  driveth  Serpents  away,  and %0a%3c discovereth  them  who  are   subject  to  the  Epilepsy.     They %0a%3c carry  the  Marks  of  their  Age  on  their  Heads  ;    for   every %0a%3c Year  addeth  one  Branch  to  their  Horns,  until  they  come  to %0a%3c six  (sexcennes),   after   which   Time   the    same    Number   is %0a%3c renewed ;  so  that  their  Age  cannot  be  discerned  any  more %0a%3c by  the  Head,  but  old  Age  is  shown  by  their  Teeth  :  for  in %0a%3c the  latter  Case  they  have  few  or  no  Teeth,  and  are  without %0a%3c Branches  at  the  Root  of  the  Horns ;  whereas,  when  they %0a%3c were  younger  they  used  to  have  them  standing  out  in  front %0a%3c of  the  very  Forehead.

For  instance,  if  a  stag  is  castrated  when  his %0a%3c horns  are  in  a  state  of  perfection,  they  will,  it  is  affirmed,  never  be  shed ; %0a%3c if  the  operation  is  performed  when  the  head  is  bare,  the  horns,  it  is  said, %0a%3c will  never  be  regenerated  ;  and  if  it  is  done  when  the  secretion  is  actually %0a%3c going  on,  a  stunted,  ill-formed  permanent  horn  is  the  result,  more  or  less %0a%3c developed,  according  to  the  period  at  which  the  animal  is  emasculated." — %0a%3c See  Penny  Cyclopaedia :  Art.

When  they  first  break  out  again,  they  are %0a%3c like  renewed  Kernels  of  dry  Skin  ;  then  they  grow  with %0a%3c tender  Stalks  into  reed-like  round  Excrescences,  feathered %0a%3c all  over  with  soft  Down.  So  long  as  they  are  destitute  of %0a%3c Horns  they  go  out  to  seek  Food  by  Night ;  the  Horns  grow %0a%3c hard  by  the  increasing  Heat  of  the  Sun  ;  and  then  they %0a%3c occasionally  try  them  against  Trees  ;  and  when  they  are %0a%3c satisfied  that  they  are  strong,  they  go  abroad  boldly.  It %0a%3c has  happened  that  some  of  them  have  been  taken  with  green %0a%3c Ivy  on  their  Horns,  inbred  there  since  the  Time  when  they %0a%3c employed  them  in  their  tender  State  against  some  Trees. %0a%3c Sometimes  they  are  of  a  shining  white  Colour,  such  as  was %0a%3c the  Hind  which  Q.  Serforius1  was  reported  to  have  had, %0a%3c and  which  he  persuaded  the  People  of  Spain  to  believe  to %0a%3c be  his  Soothsayer.  This  kind  of  Deer  maintain  a  Fight  with %0a%3c Serpents :  they  will  track  them  to  their  Holes,  and  by  the %0a%3c Strength  of  the  Breath  of  their  Nostrils  force  them  out :  and %0a%3c therefore  there  is  nothing  so  good  to  drive  away  Serpents %0a%3c as  the  Smell  of  burnt  Hartshorn.  But  against  their  Bite %0a%3c there  is  an  excellent  Remedy  from  the  Runnet  in  the  Maw %0a%3c of  a  Fawn  killed  in  the  Dam's  Belly.  It  is  generally  ac- %0a%3c knowledged that  Stags  live  long ;  for  an  hundred  Years  after %0a%3c Alexander  the  Great,  some  were  taken  with  golden  Collars %0a%3c that  had  been  affixed  to  them  by  that  Prince,  but  then  over- %0a%3c grown by  the  Skin  through  great  Stoutness.  This  Creature %0a%3c is  not  subject  to  feverish  Diseases,  but  he  is  effectual  to  cure %0a%3c it.

These  are  a  Lump  of  white  un- %0a%3c formed Flesh,1  little  bigger  than  Rats,  without  Eyes,  and %0a%3c without  Hair;  only  the  Claws  are  put  forth.  This  Lump, %0a%3c by  licking,  they  fashion  by  little  and  little ;  and  nothing  is %0a%3c more  rare  than  to  see  a  she-Bear  bringing  forth  her  Young : %0a%3c and  this  is  one  Cause  why  the  male  Bears  lie  hid  for %0a%3c forty  Days,  and  the  Female  for  four  Months.  If  they  have %0a%3c no  Caves,  they  build  themselves  Cabins  of  Wood,  by  ga- %0a%3c thering together  Boughs  and  Bushes,  in  order  to  be  im- %0a%3c pervious to  Rain ;  and  they  strew  soft  Leaves  upon  the %0a%3c Floor.  For  the  first  fourteen  Days  they  sleep  so  soundly, %0a%3c that  they  cannot  possibly  be  awaked,  even  with  Wounds.  In %0a%3c this  state  of  Drowsiness  they  grow  exceedingly  Fat.  This %0a%3c their  Grease2  is  a  good  Medicine  for  those  that  shed  their %0a%3c Hair.  These  (fourteen)  Days  being  past,  they  sit  up,  and %0a%3c live  by  sucking  their  fore  Feet.  Their  young  Cubs,  when %0a%3c stiff  with  Cold,  they  cherish  by  pressing  to  their  Bosom, %0a%3c much  as  Birds  do  that  sit  upon  their  Eggs.  A  wonderful %0a%3c Thing  is  told,  and  believed  by  Theophrastus,  that  if  Bears' %0a%3c Flesh3  be  taken  during  those  Days,  and  cooked,  and  then %0a%3c kept  safe,  it  will  grow.  At  this  Time  there  doth  not  appear %0a%3c any  Token  [of  Excrement]  of  Meat  that  they  have  eaten  ; %0a%3c and  very  little  Moisture  is  found  within  their  Belly.  Of %0a%3c Blood  some  few  small  Drops  lie  about  the  Heart  only,4  and %0a%3c none  at  all  in  the  whole  Body  besides.  When  Spring  is %0a%3c come,  they  quit  their  Den ;  and  at  that  Time  the  Males  are %0a%3c exceedingly  fat :  but  the  Reason  of  this  cannot  be  readily %0a%3c rendered  :  for,  as  we  said  before,  they  had  no  more  than %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  proof  of  the  errors  of  this  account,  young  bears  have  been %0a%3c extracted  from  the  mother  after  she  has  been  killed ;  and  they  have  been %0a%3c found  to  have  their  parts  as  distinct  as  other  animals.  — Wern.

Being   now %0a%3c gotten  abroad,  the  first  Thing  is  to  devour  a  certain  Herb %0a%3c named  Aron,1  to  loosen   their  Intestines,  which   otherwise %0a%3c were  grown  together ;  and  they  prepare  their  Mouths  and %0a%3c Teeth  with  the  young  Shoots  of  Brambles.    They  are  subject %0a%3c many  Times  to  Dimness  of  Sight,  for  which  Cause  especially %0a%3c they  seek  after  Honeycombs,  that  the  Bees  might  settle  on %0a%3c them,  and  with  their  Stings   make  them  bleed  about  the %0a%3c Mouth,  and  by  that   means   relieve   the  Heaviness  which %0a%3c troubleth  their  Eyes.     Bears  are  as  weak  in  the   Head  as %0a%3c Lions  are  strong  in  that  part ;  and  therefore  when  they  are %0a%3c chased  hard,  and  ready  to  cast  themselves  headlong  from  a %0a%3c Rock,    they   cover   their   Heads   with   their  Paws,  as  with %0a%3c Hands,  and  so  throw  themselves  down.     And  often  in  the %0a%3c Arena  they  are  deprived  of  Life  with  a  Blow  on  the  Ear  with  a %0a%3c Man's  Fist.    In  Spain  it  is  believed,  that  in  their  Brain  there %0a%3c is  a  poisonous  Quality  ;  and  if  it  be  taken  in  Drink,  it  driveth %0a%3c Men  into  a  kind  of  Madness,  as  if  they  were  Bears  :  in  proof %0a%3c of  which,  when  they  are  killed  in  the  Shows,  they  burn  the %0a%3c Heads.     They  also  walk  erect  on  their  two  hind  Feet :  they %0a%3c creep  down  from  a  Tree  backward :  when  they  fight  with %0a%3c Bulls  their  Manner  is  to  hang  with  all  their  Feet  about  their %0a%3c Mouth  and  Horns,  and  so  with  the  Weight  of  their  Bodies %0a%3c weary  them.   There  is  not  a  living  Creature  more  crafty,  and %0a%3c at  the  same  time  foolish  in  its  Viciousness.     It  is  recorded  in %0a%3c the  Annals,  that  when  M.  Piso  and  M.

Those  of  the %0a%3c Alps,2  also,  which  are  as  big  as  Badgers,3  lie  concealed  during %0a%3c Winter ;  but  they  are  provided  with  Victuals  before-hand, %0a%3c which  they  gather  together  and  carry  into  their  Holes.  And %0a%3c some  say,  that  when  the  Male  or  Female,  by  turns,  is  laden %0a%3c with  a  Bundle  of  Herbs,  as  much  as  it  can  grasp  within  the %0a%3c four  Legs,  it  lieth  upon  the  Back,  and  then  the  other  taketh %0a%3c hold  by  the  Tail  with  its  Mouth,  and  draweth  it  into  the %0a%3c Cave :  and  hence  it  is  that  at  that  Time  their  Backs  are %0a%3c bare.  The  like  of  these  live  also  in  Egypt;4  and  in  the  same %0a%3c Manner  they  sit  upon  their  Buttocks,5  and  go  by  Starts  on %0a%3c their  two  hind  Feet,  using  their  Fore  Feet  instead  of  Hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hedgehogs6  also  prepare  their  Provisions  for  Winter. %0a%3c They  roll  themselves  upon  Apples  that  lie  on  the  Ground, %0a%3c and  which  thus  become  fixed  on  their  Spines ;  and  one  more %0a%3c besides  they  take  in  their  Mouth,  and  so  carry  them  into %0a%3c hollow  Trees.

And  this  is  the  Cause  that  they %0a%3c never  drench  themselves  with  this  Mischief  except  in  the %0a%3c last  Hope,  for  they  cannot  endure  the  Smell  of  their  own %0a%3c Poison,  and  they  do  what  they  can  to  spare  themselves, %0a%3c reserving  it  for  the  utmost  time  of  Extremity,  so  that  they  are %0a%3c ready  to  be  taken  before  they  do  it.  The  Ball  into  which  this %0a%3c Creature  forms  itself  is  compelled  to  open  by  sprinkling  it %0a%3c with  warm  Water,  and  then  by  hanging  it  up  by  one  of  its  hind %0a%3c Feet ;  it  then  dies  with  Famine  and  Suspension  ;  for  otherwise %0a%3c it  is  not  possible  to  kill  them  and  save  their  Skin.

And  therefore  they  that %0a%3c chase  wild  Beasts  burn  the  Body  of  this  Animal,  and  sprin- %0a%3c kle the  Powder  on  the  Pieces  of  other  Flesh,  as  Flour  is %0a%3c dusted  over  Meat  in  cooking,  by  way  of  Bait ;  and  thus  with %0a%3c the  Ashes  of  his  Enemy  they  kill  him,  so  adverse  to  his %0a%3c Nature  is  this  Pest !  No  Wonder,  therefore,  if  the  Lion %0a%3c hate  it,  and  so  soon  as  he  spieth  it  he  crusheth  it,  and  so %0a%3c killeth  it  without  setting  Tooth  to  its  Body.  The  Leon- %0a%3c tophonos, for  its  part,  is  also  prepared  to  sprinkle  him  with %0a%3c its  Urine,  knowing  that  this  is  a  deadly  Poison  to  the %0a%3c Lion. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  those  Countries  where  the  Lynxes  breed,2  their  Mois- %0a%3c ture, after  it  is  made,  congealeth  and  hardeneth  into  precious %0a%3c Stones  resembling  Carbuncles,  shining  of  the  Colour  of  Fire, %0a%3c and  called  Lyncurium.3  And  on  this  Account  many  have %0a%3c written,  that  Amber  is  formed  after  the  same  Manner.

It  is,  how- %0a%3c ever, by  no  means  clear,  that  the  ancients  intended  to  describe  Belemnites %0a%3c under  these  appellations.

We  have  heard,  beyond  doubt,  of  a  Dog,  that  in %0a%3c Defence  of  his  Master  fought  hard  against  Thieves  ;  and %0a%3c although  he  was  wounded  through  the  Body  in  many  Places, %0a%3c yet  would  he  not  abandon  him,  but  drove  away  the  wild %0a%3c Birds  and  savage  Beasts :  also  of  another  in  Epirus,  who  in %0a%3c a  great  Assembly  of  the  People,  recognising  the  Man  who %0a%3c had  murdered  his  Master,  by  barking  at  and  tearing  him %0a%3c furiously,  compelled  him  to  confess  the  Crime.  Two  hundred %0a%3c Dogs  restored  from  Exile  a  King  of  the  Garamantes ;  fight- %0a%3c ing against  all  that  opposed  him.  The  Colophonians,  and %0a%3c also  the  Castabaleans,  possessed  Squadrons  (Cohorts)  of %0a%3c Dogs  for  War  ;  and  these  were  put  in  the  front  of  the  Battle, %0a%3c and  were  never  known  to  draw  back.  These  were  their %0a%3c trustiest  Auxiliaries,  and  never  in  want  of  Pay.  In  a  Battle %0a%3c when  the  Cimbri  were  slain,  the  Dogs  defended  their  Houses %0a%3c placed  upon  the  Waggons.  Jason  the  Lycian  had  a  Dog, %0a%3c which,  after  his  Master  was  slain,  would  never  eat  Meat,  but %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  When  Pliny  tells  us  that  some  Lizards  were  a  cubit  in  length,  while %0a%3c others  were  twenty-four  feet,  it  will  hardly  be  necessary  to  inform  the %0a%3c reader  that  the  Romans  included  many  different  species,  and  even  genera, %0a%3c under  the  terms  Lacerta  and  Lacertus.  —Wern.

Duris  maketh  mention  of  another %0a%3c Dog,  which  he  named  Hircanus,  that  when  the  funeral  Fire %0a%3c of  King  Lysimachus  was  set  a-burning,  leapt  into  the  Flame. %0a%3c And  so  did  another  at  the  Funeral  of  King  Hiero.  Also %0a%3c Phylistus  commemorateth  the  Dog  of  King  Pyrrhus,  and %0a%3c another  belonging  to  the  Tyrant  Gelo.  They  report  of  a  Dog %0a%3c belonging  to  Nicomedes,  King  of  Numidia,  which  flew  upon %0a%3c Consingis  his  Wife  for  toying  overwantonly  with  her  Hus- %0a%3c band. And  even  with  us,  Volcatius,  a  noble  Gentleman, %0a%3c who  taught  Geselius  the  Civil  Law,  as  he  returned  Home  one %0a%3c Evening,  riding  upon  an  Hackney  from  a  Village  near  the %0a%3c City,  was  defended  from  a  Highwayman  by  his  Dog.  Ccelius, %0a%3c likewise,  a  Senator,  lying  sick  at  Placentia,  was  violently %0a%3c attacked  by  armed  Men,  but  they  were  not  able  to  wound %0a%3c him,  until  they  had  killed  the  Dog.  But  that  exceedeth  all, %0a%3c which  happened  in  our  Time,  and  standeth  upon  Record  in %0a%3c the  Registers :  when  Appius  Junius  and  P.  Silus  were  Con- %0a%3c suls, and  T.  Sabinus  and  his  Servants  were  punished  on  ac- %0a%3c count of  Nero  the  Son  of  Germanicus :  one  of  them  that  was %0a%3c put  to  Death  had  a  Dog  which  could  not  be  kept  from  the %0a%3c Prison ;  and  when  his  Master  was  thrown  down  the  Stairs %0a%3c called  Scalse  Gemonise,  he  would  not  depart  from  his  dead %0a%3c Body,  but  kept  up  a  most  piteous  Howling  about  it,  in  the %0a%3c Sight  of  a  great  Multitude  of  Romans  that  stood  about  it; %0a%3c and  when  one  of  the  Company  threw  the  Dog  a  piece  of %0a%3c Meat,  he  carried  it  to  the  Mouth  of  his  dead  Master.  When %0a%3c the  dead  Body  was  thrown  into  the  Tiber,  the  Dog  swam %0a%3c after  it,  and  endeavoured  to  bear  it  afloat ;  and  a  large  Num- %0a%3c ber of  People  poured  out  of  the  City  to  behold  the  Fidelity %0a%3c of  the  Animal.  They  are  the  only  Animals  that  know  their %0a%3c Master ;  and  if  an  unknown  Person  approach  suddenly,  they %0a%3c are  aware  of  his  coming.  They  are  the  only  Animals  that %0a%3c know  their  own  Names,  and  the  People  of  the  House  by %0a%3c the  Sound  of  their  Voice.  They  remember  the  Way,  how- %0a%3c ever long  it  is,  if  they  have  once  gone  over  it.  And  there  is %0a%3c no  Creature,  beside  Man,  that  hath  a  better  Memory.  Their %0a%3c Violence  and  Fury  are  appeased  by  a  Man  sitting  down %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  71 %0a%3c %0a%3c upon  the  Ground.1  The  longer  we  live  the  more  Things  we %0a%3c observe  still  in  Dogs ;  but  their  Skill  and  Sagacity  are %0a%3c chiefly  displayed  in  Hunting :  they  examine  and  follow  up %0a%3c the  Footmarks,  leading  the  Hunter  who  attends  them  to  the %0a%3c very  Place  where  the  Beast  lieth  ;  and  having  gotten  an  Eye %0a%3c of  his  Game,  how  silent  and  secret,  how  significant  is  their %0a%3c Discovery  to  the  Hunter,  first  wagging  the  Tail,  and  mark- %0a%3c ing with  their  Nose !  And  even  when  Dogs  are  worn  out, %0a%3c weak  and  blind,  Men  carry  them  in  their  Arms  to  hunt, %0a%3c to  wind  the  Beast,  and  by  Scent  to  show  by  their  pointing %0a%3c of  the  Nose  where  the  Beast  is  at  Harbour.  The  Indians %0a%3c desire  to  procure  a  Cross  between  the  Dog  and  the  Tiger ; %0a%3c and  for  this  Purpose,  at  the  proper  Time,  they  tie  the %0a%3c Bitches  in  the  Woods.  They  suppose  the  first  and  second %0a%3c Litter  of  such  as  are  thus  bred  to  be  too  fierce ;  but  the  third %0a%3c they  bring  up.  The  Gauls  do  the  same  by  their  Dogs  that %0a%3c are  produced  from  Wolves;  and  of  which  they  have  Flocks, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  the  fury  of  a  dog  is  mitigated  by  a  man's  sitting  down,  Homer %0a%3c also  informs  us,  Odyssey,  xiv.  33  : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Soon  as  Ulysses  near  the  inclosure  drew, %0a%3c With  open  mouths  the  furious  mastiffs  flew  : %0a%3c Down  sat  the  sage,  and  cautious  to  withstand, %0a%3c Let  fall  the  offensive  truncheon  from  his  hand. %0a%3c Sudden  the  master  runs ;  aloud  he  calls ; %0a%3c And  from  his  hasty  hand  the  leather  falls ; %0a%3c With  showers  of  stones  he  drives  them  far  away ; %0a%3c The  scattering  dogs  around  at  distance  bay." —  POPE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Mure,  in  his  "  Journal  of  a  Tour  in  Greece  and  the  Ionian  Islands," %0a%3c tells  us,  that  "  at  Argos  one  evening,  at  the  table  of  General  Gordon, %0a%3c then  commanding  in  chief  in  the  Morea,  the  conversation  happened  to %0a%3c turn,  as  it  frequently  does  when  tourists  are  in  company,  on  the  subject %0a%3c of  the  number  and  fierceness  of  the  Greek  dogs  ;  when  one  of  the  com- %0a%3c pany remarked  that  he  knew  a  very  simple  expedient  for  appeasing  their %0a%3c fury.  Happening,  on  a  journey,  to  miss  his  road,  and  being  overtaken %0a%3c by  darkness,  he  sought  refuge  for  the  night  at  a  pastoral  settlement  by %0a%3c the  wayside.  As  he  approached,  the  dogs  rushed  out  upon  him,  and  the %0a%3c consequences  might  have  been  serious  had  he  not  been  rescued  by  an  old %0a%3c shepherd,  the  Eumseus  of  the  fold,  who  sallied  forth,  and  finding  that  the %0a%3c intruder  was  but  a  benighted  traveller,  after  pelting  off  his  assailants, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 72  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  VIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c that  have  for  their  Leader  and  Captain  some  one  Dog :  him %0a%3c they  accompany  when  they  hunt ;  him  they  are  directed  by: %0a%3c for  they  keep  an  Order  among  themselves  of  Mastership.  It %0a%3c is  certain  that  the  Dogs  which  live  near  the  Nile  lap  of  the %0a%3c River1  as  they  run,  that  they  may  not  afford  an  Opportunity %0a%3c to  the  Greediness  of  the  Crocodiles.  When  Alexander  the %0a%3c Great  made  his  Journey  into  India,  the  King  of  Albania %0a%3c gave  him  a  Dog  of  extraordinary  Size  ;  and  Alexander  taking %0a%3c great  Delight  in  such  an  Example  of  a  Dog,  commanded %0a%3c them  to  let  loose  on  him  Bears,  and  afterwards  wild  Boars ; %0a%3c and  last  of  all,  fallow  Deers ;  but  he  lay  still  with  silent %0a%3c Contempt.  This  great  Commander,  a  Man  of  high  Mind, %0a%3c offended  at  the  Laziness  of  so  great  a  Body,  commanded %0a%3c that  he  should  be  killed.  News  of  this  went  presently  to  the %0a%3c King ;  and  therefore  he  sent  a  second  Dog,  with  this  Mes- %0a%3c sage :  That  he  should  not  make  trial  of  this  too  against %0a%3c small  Beasts,  but  set  him  against  a  Lion  or  an  Elephant : %0a%3c adding,  that  he  had  no  more  than  those  two  ;  and  if  this %0a%3c were  killed  likewise,  it  was  not  likely  he  would  have  more  of %0a%3c that  Race.  Alexander  made  no  delay,  and  presently  saw  a %0a%3c Lion  torn  to  Pieces.  Afterwards  he  commanded  them  to %0a%3c bring  out  an  Elephant,  and  in  no  Sight  did  he  take  greater %0a%3c Pleasure  than  in  this.  For  the  Dog's  rough,  shaggy  Hair, %0a%3c %0a%3c gave  him  a  hospitable  reception  in  his  hut.  His  guest  made  some  remark %0a%3c on  the  watchfulness  and  zeal  of  his  dogs,  and  on  the  danger  to  which  he %0a%3c had  been  exposed  on  their  attack.  The  old  man  replied  that  it  was  his %0a%3c own  fault  for  not  taking  the  customary  precaution  in  such  an  emergency, — %0a%3c that  he  ought  to  have  stopped,  and  sat  down,  until  some  person  whom  the %0a%3c animals  knew  came  to  protect  him.  As  this  expedient  was  new  to  the %0a%3c traveller,  he  made  some  further  inquiries,  and  was  assured,  that  if  any %0a%3c person  in  such  a  predicament  will  simply  seat  himself  on  the  ground,  lay- %0a%3c ing aside  his  weapons  of  defence,  the  dogs  will  also  squat  in  a  circle  round %0a%3c him ;  that  as  long  as  he  remains  quiet,  they  will  follow  his  example ;  but %0a%3c as  soon  as  he  rises,  and  moves  forward,  they  will  renew  the  assault." — %0a%3c Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  I  was  very  well  pleased  to  see  here,  for  the  first  time,  two  shepherd %0a%3c dogs  lapping  up  the  water  from  the  stream,  then  lying  down  in  it  with %0a%3c great  seeming  leisure  and  satisfaction.  It  refuted  the  old  fable  that  the %0a%3c dogs  living  on  the  banks  of  the  Nile  run  as  they  drink,  for  fear  of  the %0a%3c crocodile."  —  BRUCE'S  Travels,  vol.  ii.  p.  7.  —  Wern.

Soon  after  he  leapeth  and  flieth  upon %0a%3c him,  rising  and  mounting  against  the  great  Beast,  now  on %0a%3c one  Side,  and  then  on  the  other,  in  skilful  Combat,  ac- %0a%3c cording as  Opportunity  offered,  one  while  assailing  and %0a%3c another  while  avoiding  his  Enemy  ;  so  that  with  continual %0a%3c turning  round,  the  Elephant  grew  giddy  in  the  Head,  so %0a%3c that  he  came  tumbling  down  to  the  Ground,  which  shook %0a%3c with  the  Fall.  Dogs  bear  Young  once  in  a  Year ;  and  the %0a%3c due  Time  for  them  to  be  with  Whelps  is  when  they  are  a %0a%3c Year  old.  They  go  with  Young  threescore  Days.  Their %0a%3c Puppies  come  blind  into  the  World ;  and  the  more  Milk %0a%3c they  suck,  the  later  it  is  before  they  receive  their  Sight :  but %0a%3c it  is  never  above  twenty  Days  before  they  see,  and  they  do %0a%3c not  open  their  Eyes  under  seven  Days  old.  Some  say  that  if %0a%3c but  one  be  born  at  a  Litter,  it  will  see  in  nine  Days ;  if  two, %0a%3c it  will  be  in  ten  Days ;  and  the  more  Puppies  she  hath,  the %0a%3c more  Days  it  will  be  in  that  Proportion  before  they  see : %0a%3c also,  that  the  Bitch-whelp  which  cometh  of  the  first  Litter %0a%3c discerns  Fairies.1  The  best  of  the  whole  Litter  is  that  Whelp %0a%3c which  is  last  to  begin  to  see ;  or  that  which  the  Bitch  car- %0a%3c rieth  first  into  her  Kennel.  The  Madness  of  Dogs  is  most %0a%3c dangerous  to  a  Man,  as  we  have  said  before,  while  Syrius  is %0a%3c burning  hot ;  for  they  that  are  so  bitten  have  a  deadly  Fear %0a%3c of  Water.  To  prevent  this,  therefore,  it  is  good  for  thirty %0a%3c Days  to  mingle  Hen's  Dung  with  the  Meat  of  the  Dogs ;  or, %0a%3c if  the  Disease  be  coming  on,  Hellebore. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLI. %0a%3c Against  the  Bite  of  a  mad  Dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  sovereign  Remedy  against  this  Bite  was  revealed %0a%3c lately  by  a  certain  Oracle  :2  being  the  Root  of  a  wild  Rose, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Fauni  here  mentioned,  and  again  Lib.  xxv.  4,  and  which  we %0a%3c have  translated  by  the  modern  term  "  Fairies,"  were  a  species  of  Incubi, %0a%3c supposed  to  occasion  the  nightmare  and  other  similar  diseases. — Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3  Lib.  xxv.  2. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 74  History  of  Nature.

I  have  myself  observed,  that  among  the %0a%3c Prodigies  it  is  reported,  that  a  Dog  spoke  ;  as  also  that  a %0a%3c Serpent  barked  at  the  Time  when  Tarquin  was  driven  from %0a%3c the  Kingdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLII. %0a%3c Of  the  Nature  of  Horses. I %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  same  Alexander  of  whom  we  have  spoken,  had  a %0a%3c very  uncommon  Horse,  which  they  called  Bucephalus  ;  either %0a%3c from  his  stern  Look,  or  from  the  Mark  of  a  Bull's  Head  im- %0a%3c printed on  his  Shoulder.  It  is  reported  of  Alexander,  that %0a%3c being  but  a'  Boy,  he  was  so  much  attracted  by  his  handsome %0a%3c Appearance,  that  he  bought  him  out  of  the  Flock  of  Philo- %0a%3c nicus  the  Pharsalian,  at  the  Price  of  sixteen  Talents.  He %0a%3c would  suffer  no  Man  to  sit  on  his  Back  but  Alexander,  when %0a%3c he  had  the  royal  Saddle  and  Furniture  on ;  rejecting  others %0a%3c entirely.  The  same  Horse  was  of  memorable  service  in %0a%3c Battles,  and  being  wounded  at  the  Assault  of  Thebes  he %0a%3c would  not  suffer  Alexander  to  alight  and  mount  upon  ano- %0a%3c ther. Many  other  Things  of  the  same  kind  he  did  ;  on  Ac- %0a%3c count of  which,  when  he  was  dead,  the  King  conducted  his %0a%3c Funeral  sumptuously  ;  erected  a  Tomb  for  him,  and  about  it %0a%3c built  a  City  that  bore  his  Name.  C&sar  the  Dictator  like- %0a%3c wise had  a  Horse  which  would  not  suffer  any  Man  to  ride %0a%3c him  but  his  Master ;  and  the  same  Horse  had  his  Forefeet %0a%3c resembling  those  of  a  Man  ;  and  its  Statue  so  formed  is %0a%3c placed  before  the  Temple  of  Venus  Genetrix.  Divus  Au- %0a%3c gustus also  formed  a  Tomb  for  his  Horse ;  concerning  which %0a%3c there  is  a  Poem  by  Germanicus  Ccesar.  At  Agrigentum %0a%3c there  are  Pyramids  on  the  Tombs  of  many  Horses.

A  Chieftain  of  theirs  happening  in %0a%3c Combat  on  a  Challenge  to  be  slain  by  his  Enemy,  when  the %0a%3c Conqueror  came  to  take  the  Spoil,  he  was  killed  by  the %0a%3c Kicks  and  Biting  of  the  Horse  of  the  conquered.  There  was %0a%3c another  Horse,  that  when  the  Covering  was  removed  from %0a%3c his  Eyes,  and  he  knew  that  he  had  served  as  a  Stallion  to  his %0a%3c own  Dam,  rushed  to  a  Precipice,  and  threw  himself  down %0a%3c and  died.  We  find,  also,  that  in  the  Territory  of  Reate,  an %0a%3c Horsekeeper  was  torn  upon  the  same  Occasion  of  a  Mare. %0a%3c For  surely  these  Animals  understand  their  Relationship ; %0a%3c and  therefore  Colts  will  in  the  Flock  more  willingly  keep %0a%3c Company  with  their  Sisters  of  the  former  Year,  than  with %0a%3c the  Mare  their  Mother.  Horses  are  so  docile,  that  we %0a%3c find  in  the  Army  of  the  Sybaritani,  the  whole  Troop  of  Horse- %0a%3c men had  their  Horses  accustomed  to  be  moved  to  a  certain %0a%3c Dance  at  the  Sound  of  Music.  They  have  an  Anticipation %0a%3c of  a  Battle,  and  mourn  the  Loss  of  their  Masters;  some- %0a%3c times also,  they  shed  tears  for  Love  of  them.  When  King %0a%3c Nicomedes  was  slain,  his  Horse  starved  itself  to  Death. %0a%3c Philarchus  reporteth,  that  King  Antiochus  having  in  Battle %0a%3c slain  Centaretus,  a  Galatian,  became  possessed  of  his  Horse, %0a%3c and  mounted  him  in  a  triumphant  manner ;  but  the  Horse, %0a%3c seized  with  Indignation,  would  not  be  restrained  by  the %0a%3c Bridle,  but  ran  furiously  to  a  Precipice,  and  threw  itself %0a%3c down  ;  where  both  Horse  and  Man  perished  together.  Phi- %0a%3c listus  writeth,  that  when  Dionysius  left  his  Horse  stickng %0a%3c fast  in  the  Mire  that  he  might  save  himself,  the  Animal %0a%3c followed  the  Tracks  of  his  Master,  with  a  Swarm  of  Bees %0a%3c settling  in  his  Mane ;  which  was  the  first  Presage  that  in- %0a%3c duced Dionysius  to  usurp  the  Tyranny.  The  variety  of  their %0a%3c Skill  cannot  be  expressed ;  and  those  who  throw  Darts %0a%3c have  Proof  of  their  entire  Obedience,  in  urging  them  to  the %0a%3c most  difficult  Attempts  with  great  Dexterity  and  striving  of %0a%3c the  Body.  They  even  gather  up  Darts  from  the  Ground, %0a%3c and  reach  them  to  the  Horseman  ;  and  when  they  are  fast- %0a%3c ened to  the  Chariots  in  the  Circus  they  display  beyond  a %0a%3c doubt  their  Consciousness  of  Encouragement  and  Glory.

A %0a%3c greater  Augury  happened  in  old  Time,  when  in  the  Plebeian %0a%3c Circensian  Games,  the  Driver  was  thrown  out  of  the  Cha- %0a%3c riot, and  yet  the  Horses  ran  directly  into  the  Capitol,  as  if %0a%3c he  had  stood  still  in  his  Place  ;  and  there  they  ran  three  times %0a%3c round  the  Temple.  But  the  greatest  of  all  was,  that  the %0a%3c Horses  of  Ratumenas  came  thither  from  Veij,  with  the %0a%3c Palm  and  Crown  which  they  had  won  there,  after  they  had %0a%3c thrown  out  their  Master,  who  had  conquered  in  the  Games %0a%3c at  that  City;  from  whom  the  Gate  (Ratumena)1  took  its %0a%3c Name.  The  Sarmatians,  when  they  intend  to  take  a  great %0a%3c Journey,  prepare  their  Horses  two  Days  before,  by  giving %0a%3c them  no  Meat,  and  only  allow  them  a  little  Drink ;  and  thus %0a%3c they  will  ride  them  an  hundred  and  fifty  Miles  at  one  Stretch. %0a%3c Some  Horses  live  fifty  Years,  but  Mares  not  so  long.  In  five %0a%3c Years  the  latter  come  to  their  full  Growth,  but  Horses  grow %0a%3c one  Year  longer.  The  Beauty  of  Horses,  such  as  a  Man %0a%3c would  choose  for  the  best,  hath  been  very  elegantly  and  com- %0a%3c pletely described  by  the  Poet  Virgil.'1  And  we  also  have %0a%3c spoken  of  the  same  Thing  in  a  Book  lately  put  forth,  con- %0a%3c cerning Dart-throwing  on  Horseback  ;  and  about  what  is %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Plutarch's  account  of  this  circumstance,  which  he  gives  in  the  Life  of %0a%3c Publicola,  is  as  follows  :  — -  "  It  happened  that  there  was  a  chariot  race  at %0a%3c Veii,  which  was  observed  as  usual ;  except  that,  as  the  charioteer,  who  had %0a%3c won  the  prize  and  received  the  crown  was  gently  driving  out  of  the  ring,  the %0a%3c horses  took  fright  from  no  visible  cause ;  but,  either  by  some  direction  of %0a%3c the  gods,  or  turn  of  fortune,  ran  away  with  their  driver,  at  full  speed  to- %0a%3c wards Rome.  It  was  in  vain  that  he  pulled  the  reins,  or  soothed  them %0a%3c with  words ;  he  was  obliged  to  give  way  to  the  career,  and  was  whirled %0a%3c along  till  they  came  to  the  Capitol,  where  they  flung  him,  at  the  gate  now %0a%3c called  Ratumena." — LANGHORNE'S  Translation.  —  Wern.

But  for  Horses %0a%3c trained  to  the  Circus,  a  different  mode  of  Proceeding  is  to  be %0a%3c sought  for.  For  whereas  they  may  be  broke  into  other  Em- %0a%3c ployments when  they  are  two  Years  old,  they  must  not  be %0a%3c brought  to  enter  into  that  Contest  before  they  are  five  Years %0a%3c of  Age.  The  Females  in  this  kind  go  eleven  Months  with %0a%3c Young,  and  in  the  twelfth  they  Foal.  The  Sexes  are  put %0a%3c together  at  the  Spring  Equinox,  when  both  of  them  are  two %0a%3c Years  old  ;  but  if  they  be  kept  until  they  are  three  Years  of %0a%3c Age,  they  produce  stronger  Colts.  The  Male  is  fertile  to %0a%3c three-and-thirty  Years  old ;  so  that  when  they  are  dismissed %0a%3c from  the  Circus,  after  their  twentieth  Year,  they  are  sent  to %0a%3c produce  Offspring.  And  it  is  said  that  they  will  continue  to %0a%3c forty  Years  with  a  little  Help  put  to  the  Forepart  of  the %0a%3c Body,  to  lift  him  up.  Few  Beasts  besides  are  less  capable %0a%3c of  Fertility  than  the  Male ;  for  which  Cause  they  are  allowed %0a%3c some  Space  between,  and  in  one  Year  the  most  that  can  be %0a%3c allowed  is  fifteen.  The  Way  to  quench  the  Heat  of  a  Mare  is %0a%3c to  shear  her  Mane.  Arid  yet  Mares  can  bear  every  Year  until %0a%3c they  come  to  forty  Years.  It  is  reported  that  an  Horse  hath %0a%3c lived  three-score  and  fifteen  Years.  Mares  only  among  all %0a%3c Races  produce  their  Foals  standing  on  their  Feet;  and  they %0a%3c love  them  more  than  any  other  Creatures  do  their  Young. %0a%3c Foals  truly  have  on  their  Forehead  a  black  Thing  of  the %0a%3c Bigness  of  a  Fig,  called  Hippomanes,1  which  is  a  powerful %0a%3c Charm  to  procure  Love ;  and  this  the  Dam  devours  as  soon %0a%3c as  the  Colt  is  born ;  and  if  it  chance  that  any  Person  hath %0a%3c managed  to  secure  it  before  her,  she  will  not  permit  the  Foal %0a%3c to  suck  her.  Horses  are  driven  into  Madness  by  the  Smell. %0a%3c If  a  young  Foal  lose  her  Dam,  the  other  Mares  of  the  com- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Lib.  xxviii.  11.  The  Hippomanes  was  a  sort  of  poison  famous %0a%3c among  the  ancients  as  an  ingredient  in  amorous  philters,  or  love-charms. %0a%3c At  the  end  of  Bayle's  Dictionary  is  a  very  learned  dissertation  on  the %0a%3c Hippomanes,  and  all  its  virtues,  both  real  and  imaginary.  ^Elian  (B.  xiv. %0a%3c c.  18)  says  that  this  caruncle  was  either  affixed  to  the  forehead,  loins,  or %0a%3c KU.TOC.

But  the  virtues  ascribed  to  it  were  so  singular,  that, %0a%3c credulous  as  this  author  commonly  is,  he  is  compelled  to  express  some %0a%3c doubts  of  their  truth.  —  Wern.

It  is  said,  that %0a%3c for  three  Days  after  they  are  newly  foaled,  the  young  Colts %0a%3c cannot  lay  their  Mouth  to  the  Ground.  The  hotter  sto- %0a%3c mached an  Horse  is,  the  deeper  he  thrusteth  his  Nose  into %0a%3c the  Water  as  he  drinketh.  The  Scythians  chose  rather  to  use %0a%3c their  Mares  in  War,  because  their  staling  is  no  Hindrance  to %0a%3c their  Running.  It  is  an  admitted  Fact  that  in  Lusitania,  along %0a%3c the  River  Tagus,  and  about  the  City  Olyssipo  (Lisbon)  when %0a%3c the  West  Wind  bloweth,1  the  Mares  set  themselves  full  against %0a%3c it,  and  so  conceive  that  genital  Air  from  which  they  become %0a%3c pregnant,  and  bring  forth  Foals  of  exceeding  Swiftness  ;  but %0a%3c they  live  not  above  three  Years.  In  the  same  Spain,  from %0a%3c the  Parts  called  Gallaica  (Gallicia)  and  Asturica  (Asturia) %0a%3c there  is  produced  a  Race  of  Horses  which  we  call  Thieldones; %0a%3c and  others  of  less  Stature,  named  Asturcones.  These  Horses %0a%3c have  a  pleasant  Pace  peculiar  to  themselves ;  with  one  Foot %0a%3c set  down  before  another  softly  and  roundly  in  order  by %0a%3c turns ;  from  which  our  Horse-breakers  have  obtained  the  Art %0a%3c by  Cords  to  bring  an  Horse  to  the  like  Amble.  A  Horse  is %0a%3c subject  to  almost  the  same  Diseases  as  a  Man  :  and  also  to %0a%3c the  turning  of  the  Bladder  :  as  likewise  all  other  Beasts  that %0a%3c labour. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIII. %0a%3c Of  Asses* %0a%3c %0a%3c M.

Axius,  a  Senator,  bought  an %0a%3c Ass  at  the  Price  of  four  hundred  thousand  Sesterces:  a  Price, %0a%3c in  my  Opinion,  above  the  Worth  of  any  Beast  whatever:  and %0a%3c yet  (no  Doubt)  he  was  able  to  do  wondrous  good  Service  in %0a%3c carrying  Burdens,  ploughing  the  Ground,  and  principally  in %0a%3c getting  Mules.  In  the  Purchase  there  is  special  Regard  to %0a%3c the  Country  from  whence  they  come ;  as  from  Arcadia  in %0a%3c Achaia,  and  Reate  in  Italy.

Neither  do  they  go  with  Young,  like  other  Cattle, %0a%3c in  the  Spring  Equinox,  but  at  the  Solstice.  He-Asses  are %0a%3c the  worse  for  being  spared  in  their  Work.  The  Females %0a%3c have  bred  early,  at  the  Age  of  thirty  Months  ;  but  three %0a%3c Years  is  the  due  Time  :  as  often  as  Mares,  and  just  so %0a%3c many  Months,  and  after  the  same  Manner.  But  after %0a%3c Reception  they  must  be  forced  to  run  by  beating  them,  or %0a%3c else  they  will  let  go  their  Seed.  They  seldom  produce  two %0a%3c at  once.  The  Ass,  when  about  to  Foal,  avoideth  the  Light, %0a%3c but  seeketh  some  dark  Place,  that  she  may  not  be  seen  by %0a%3c Man.  She  breeds  all  her  Life-time,  which  is  to  her  thirty %0a%3c Years.  They  love  their  young  Foals  exceedingly  well:  but  they %0a%3c cannot  abide  Water.  To  their  little  ones  they  will  go  through %0a%3c Fire ;  but  if  there  be  the  least  Brook  between,  they  are  so %0a%3c afraid,  that  they  dare  not  dip  their  Feet  therein.  They  will %0a%3c not  drink,  except  of  their  accustomed  Fountains,  within  their %0a%3c Feeding-ground ;  and  in  such  a  Manner  that  they  may  go %0a%3c along  a  dry  Path  to  their  Drink :  neither  will  they  go  over  any %0a%3c Bridges  where  the  Planks  are  not  so  close  together  as  that %0a%3c they  see  the  Water  through.  Strange  to  say,  they  are  thirsty; %0a%3c but  if  their  Water  be  changed,  they  must  be  forced  to  drink, %0a%3c or  else  unloaded  of  their  Burdens.  They  love  to  lie  at  large, %0a%3c and  have  Room  enough.  For  in  their  Sleep  they  dream  of %0a%3c various  Fancies  appearing  to  them  ;  and  so  they  fling  about %0a%3c them  with  their  Heels  in  every  Direction ;  by  which,  if  they %0a%3c should  beat  against  some  hard  Thing,  they  would  soon  be %0a%3c lame.  They  are  more  profitable  to  their  Masters  than  the %0a%3c Revenues  of  good  Farms.  It  is  well  known,  that  in  Celti- %0a%3c beria  she-Asses,  by  breeding,  have  produced  the  Value  of %0a%3c 400,000  Sesterces.  For  the  foaling  of  Mules,  they  affirm  that %0a%3c the  principal  Thing  to  be  regarded  in  the  Ass  is  the  Hair %0a%3c of  the  Ears  and  the  Eyelids.  For  however  the  whole  Body %0a%3c besides  be  of  one  Colour,  yet  shall  the  Mules  foaled  have %0a%3c as  many  Colours  as  were  in  those  Parts.  Meccenas  was  the %0a%3c first  that  introduced  at  Feasts  a  Dish  of  young  Ass-flesh  ; l  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  See  the  note  on  the  Lalisiones  in  the  next  chapter.  —Wern.

[BOOK  VIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c he  preferred  their  Flesh  at  that  time  before  that  of  wild  Asses. %0a%3c But  after  him  the  Reputation  of  their  Delicacy  decayed.  If %0a%3c an  Ass  be  seen  to  die,  the  whole  Race  will  very  soon  follow %0a%3c to  the  very  last. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIV. %0a%3c Of  Mules. %0a%3c %0a%3c BETWEEN  the  He-Ass  and  a  Mare  a  Mule  is  produced  in %0a%3c the  twelfth  Month  :  a  Creature  of  exceeding  Strength  for %0a%3c Labour.  For  breeding  such  Mules  they  choose  Mares  that %0a%3c are  not  under  four  Years  old,  nor  above  ten.  They  relate %0a%3c that  they  will  drive  away  one  another  in  both  kinds,  unless %0a%3c they  sucked  the  Milk  of  the  Dam,  when  they  were  young,  of %0a%3c that  kind  by  which  they  would  produce.  And  for  this  Pur- %0a%3c pose they  remove  away  either  the  young  Ass-Foals,  and  set %0a%3c them  in  the  dark  to  the  Teats  of  the  Mare,  or  else  the  young %0a%3c Colts  to  suck  of  the  she- Ass.  For  there  is  a  Mule  also  that %0a%3c cometh  of  a  Horse  and  a  female  Ass :  but  they  are  unruly, %0a%3c and  of  unconquerable  Slowness  :  and  much  more  if  they  be %0a%3c far  in  Age.  If,  when  a  she- Ass  hath  conceived  by  an  Horse, %0a%3c she  admit  an  Ass,  an  Abortion  follows ;  but  it  is  not  so  if %0a%3c an  Horse  follow  an  Ass.  It  is  observed,  that  seven  Days %0a%3c after  an  Ass  hath  foaled  is  the  best  Time  for  another  Con- %0a%3c ception; and,  also,  that  the  he- Asses  succeed  best  when %0a%3c weary  with  Travel.  That  Ass  is  understood  to  be  barren %0a%3c which  hath  not  conceived  before  she  hath  cast  her  Foal's- %0a%3c teeth ;  and  also  she  which  doth  not  conceive  at  the  first.  In %0a%3c old  Time  they  used  to  call  those  Hinuli,  which  were  begotten %0a%3c between  an  Horse  and  an  Ass  :  and,  on  the  other  Hand, %0a%3c Mules,  such  as  were  between  an  Ass  and  a  Mare.  Also %0a%3c it  is  observed,  that  a  Creature  born  from  Beasts  of  two %0a%3c different  kinds,  formeth  a  third  Sort,  resembling  neither  of %0a%3c the  Parents  ;  and  that  such  as  are  produced  in  this  Manner, %0a%3c whatever  kind  of  Creatures  they  are,  are  themselves  barren  ; %0a%3c and  therefore  she -Mules  never  breed.  We  find  in  our %0a%3c Chronicles,  that  oftentimes  Mules  have  brought  forth,  but %0a%3c it  was  always  taken  for  a  Prodigy.  Theophrastus  saith, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  81 %0a%3c %0a%3c that  in  Cappadocia  ordinarily  they  produce  Foals ;  but  there %0a%3c they  are  a  distinct  kind  of  Animal.  Mules  are  broken  of  their %0a%3c Kicking  if  they  are  often  made  to  drink  wine.  It  is  found %0a%3c written  in  what  remains  of  many  Greeks,  that  there  has %0a%3c been  produced  between  an  he-Mule  and  a  Mare,  a  Creature %0a%3c which  the  Latins  call  Hinnus,  that  is,  a  little  Mule.  Between %0a%3c Mares  and  wild  Asses  that  have  been  made  tame  are  pro- %0a%3c duced a  kind  of  Mules,  very  swift  in  running  and  exceed- %0a%3c ingly hard-hoofed,  slender  of  body,  of  unconquered  but %0a%3c generous  spirit.  But  the  Mule  that  cometh  of  a  wild  Ass %0a%3c and  a  female  tame  Ass  exceeds  all  the  rest.  Wild  Asses %0a%3c (Onagri)  are  the  best  in  Phrygia  and  Lycaonia.  Africa %0a%3c boasts  of  the  Flesh  of  their  Foals,  which  is  excellent  Meat  ;x %0a%3c and  such  they  call  Lalisiones.  It  appeareth  in  the  Chronicles %0a%3c of  Athens,  that  a  Mule  lived  eighty  Years;  and  that  when %0a%3c they  built  the  Temple  in  the  Citadel  at  that  Place,  this  old %0a%3c Mule  being  set  aside  for  Age,  would  yet  accompany  the %0a%3c other  labouring  Beasts,  and  if  any  of  them  were  ready  to  fall %0a%3c under  their  Load,  would  relieve  and  encourage  them  accord- %0a%3c ing to  his  power:  by  which  the  people  were  so  much  pleased, %0a%3c that  they  made  a  Decree  that  the  Corn-Merchants  should %0a%3c take  good  Care  that  this  Mule  should  not  be  driven  away %0a%3c from  their  Cleansing-Sieves. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Oxen* %0a%3c IT  is  said  that  the  Oxen  of  India  are  as  high  as  Camels, %0a%3c %0a%3c o  * %0a%3c %0a%3c and  four  Feet  broad  between  the  Horns.

The  Persians  and  Tartars  hold  the  flesh %0a%3c of  the  wild  ass  in  high  esteem,  and  hunt  it  in  preference  to  all  other %0a%3c descriptions  of  game.     Olearius  assures  us  that  he  saw  no  fewer  than %0a%3c thirty-two  wild  asses  slain  in  one  day  by  the  Schah  of  Persia  and  his %0a%3c court,  and  their  bodies  were  sent  to  the  royal  kitchens  at  Ispahan.     We %0a%3c know  from  Martial  that  the  epicures  of  Rome  held  the  flesh  of  the %0a%3c Onager  in  the  same  estimation  as  we  do  venison  :— %0a%3c %0a%3c "Cum  tener  est  Onager,  solaque  lalisio  matre %0a%3c Pascitur :  hoc  infans,  sed  breve  nomen  habet." %0a%3c %0a%3c Lib.  xiii.  97.  —  Wcrn.

Therefore  they  were  of  great  Size; %0a%3c and  so  they  continue  in  their  Posterity  to  this  Day.  In  the %0a%3c present  Day,  however,  they  are  permitted  to  breed  when %0a%3c /hey  are  one  Year  old,  or  at  most  two;  which  is  more  tole- %0a%3c rable. Bulls  are  generative  when  they  are  four  Years  old ; %0a%3c and  one  is  a  sufficient  Companion  for  ten  Cows  through  the %0a%3c Year.  If  a  Bull,  after  Copulation,  go  away  toward  the  right %0a%3c Hand,  he  hath  gotten  a  male  Calf;  hut  if  to  the  left,  a  Cow %0a%3c Calf.  Cows  are  fertile  at  the  first ;  but  if  it  chance  that %0a%3c they  fail,  the  twentieth  Day  after  they  again  seek  their  Fel- %0a%3c low. In  the  tenth  Month  they  calve ;  and  whatever  cometh %0a%3c before  that  Term  is  worth  nothing.  Some  write  that  they %0a%3c calve  just  upon  the  last  Day  of  the  tenth  Month  complete. %0a%3c They  seldom  bring  forth  two  Calves  at  a  Time.  Their  Time %0a%3c of  Propagation  continueth  thirty  Days  from  the  rising  of  the %0a%3c Dolphin  to  the  Day  before  the  Nones  of  January  ;  but  some %0a%3c propagate  in  Autumn.  Indeed,  in  those  Countries  where  the %0a%3c People  live  on  Milk,  they  order  the  Matter  so,  that  they  are %0a%3c not  without  this  Food  all  the  Year  long.  Bulls  do  not  serve %0a%3c above  two  Cows  in  one  Day.  Oxen  alone  of  all  Animals  go %0a%3c backward  as  they  feed  ;  and  among  the  Garamantsb  they %0a%3c •scarcely  ever  feed  otherwise.  Cows  live  riot  above  fifteen %0a%3c Years  at  the  most ;  but  the  Males  come  to  twenty.  They  are %0a%3c in  their  full  Strength  when  five  Years  old.

And  the  best  labouring %0a%3c Oxen  are  they  which  are  yoked  by  the  Head,  and  not  the %0a%3c Neck.  In  Syria  they  have  no  Dewlaps,  but  a  Bunch  stand- %0a%3c ing on  the  Back.  They  of  Caria  also,  a  Country  in  Asia, %0a%3c are  ill-favoured  to  be  seen,  having  between  their  Necks  and %0a%3c Shoulders  a  projecting  Tumour ;  and  their  Horns  are  loose, %0a%3c as  if  out  of  Joint;  and  yet  by  Report,  tbev  are  excellent  for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  VIII.]  History  of  Nature.  83 %0a%3c %0a%3c Labour:  but  the  black  or  white  in  this  kind  are  condemned %0a%3c for  Work.  Bulls  have  less  and  slenderer  Horns  than  Cows %0a%3c or  Oxen.  The  Time  to  bring  the  Ox  or  Bull  to  the  Yoke  is %0a%3c at  three  Years  of  Age  ;  after  this  it  is  too  late,  and  before  it %0a%3c is  too  soon.  A  young  Steer  is  soonest  trained  to  draw,  if  he %0a%3c be  coupled  with  another  that  hath  been  taught  already ;  for %0a%3c this  Animal  is  our  Companion  in  Labour  and  the  Cultivation %0a%3c of  the  Ground  :  and  so  highly  regarded  was  the  Ox  by  our %0a%3c Forefathers,  that  we  find  it  on  Record  that  a  Man  was  judi- %0a%3c cially condemned  on  a  given  Day  by  the  People  of  Rome, %0a%3c because,  to  gratify  a  wanton  Concubine  of  his,  who  said  he %0a%3c had  not  eaten  any  Tripe  all  the  while  he  was  in  the  Country, %0a%3c he  had  killed  an  Ox,1  although  it  was  his  own  ;  and  for  this %0a%3c Fact  he  was  banished,  as  if  he  had  slain  his  own  Manager  of %0a%3c Husbandry.  There  is  a  Majesty  in  the  Aspect  of  a  Bull ; %0a%3c their  Countenance  stern,  their  Ears  covered  with  stiff  Hairs, %0a%3c and  their  Horns  standing  as  if  they  were  ever  demanding  to %0a%3c fight.  But  all  his  threatening  appears  in  his  Fore-feet ;  be- %0a%3c stirring himself  now  with  one  Foot,  and  then  with  another, %0a%3c as  his  Anger  bursts  forth,  flinging  the  Sand  aloft  into  the  Air: %0a%3c and  of  all  other  Beasts  he  alone  with  such  an  Incitement %0a%3c stirs  up  his  Anger.  We  have  seen  them  fight  one  another %0a%3c for  the  Mastery ;  and  thus  viewed  to  be  swung  round,  in %0a%3c their  Fall  to  be  caught  up  by  the  Horns,  and  to  rise  again  : %0a%3c when  only  lying  along,  to  be  raised  from  the  Ground  ; %0a%3c and  when  they  have  run  with  a  rapid  Pace,  in  two-wheeled %0a%3c Chariots,  they  have  stood  still  suddenly,  as  if  the  Cha- %0a%3c rioteers had  caused  them  to  stop.  It  was  an  Invention  of %0a%3c the  Thessalians,  with  a  Horse  to  gallop  close  to  the  Bull's %0a%3c Horns,  and  kill  it  by  twisting  its  Neck.  The  first  that  exhi- %0a%3c bited this  Show  to  the  People  of  Rome,  was  Cce.sar  the %0a%3c Dictator.  The  Bull  forms  the  most  worthy  and  sumptuous %0a%3c Offering  of  Reconciliation  to  the  Gods.  This  Animal  alone, %0a%3c of  all  those  that  are  long-tailed,  when  newly-born,  hath  not %0a%3c the  Tail  of  the  full  Measure,  as  others ;  but  it  continueth  to %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  According  to  ^Elian,  B.  xii.  c.  34,  among  the  Phrygians  death  was %0a%3c the  regular  punishment  of  any  one  who  killed  his  plough  ox.  —  Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84  History  of  Nature.

This  also  is %0a%3c noted,  that  Calves  brought  on  Men's  Shoulders  to  the  Altars %0a%3c are  not  for  the  most  Part  accepted  for  Sacrifice ;  nor  one %0a%3c that  is  lame ;  nor  can  the  Gods  be  appeased  with  those %0a%3c Sacrifices  which  are  foreign  to  them,  nor  with  such  as  draw %0a%3c themselves  back  from  the  Altar.  Among  the  Prodigies  that %0a%3c we  read  of  in  ancient  Times,  we  find  that  an  Ox  hath  spoke  ; l %0a%3c and  when  this  was  announced,  the  Senate  was  accustomed  to %0a%3c be  held  in  an  open  Place. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLVI. %0a%3c Of  the  Ox  Apis. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  Egypt,  also,  an  Ox2  is  worshipped  as  a  God,  and  they %0a%3c call  it  Apis.3  It  was  marked  with  a  white  Spot  on  the  right %0a%3c Side,  like  the  Horns  of  the  new  Moon  ;  a  Knob  under  the %0a%3c Tongue,  which  they  call  Cantharus:4  it  was  not  lawful  to %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  When  a  report  was  brought  that  an  ox  had  spoken,  the  senate  was %0a%3c held  in  the  open  air.  (Adams'  "  Rom.  Antiq."  p.  9.)  This  was  against  the %0a%3c custom,  because  under  ordinary  circumstances  the  senate  could  only  meet %0a%3c in  stated  places — at  first  limited  to  two  within  the  city,  and  the  temple  of %0a%3c Bellona  without  it ;  afterwards  the  right  was  extended  to  several  temples %0a%3c and  curiae  —  the  latter  being  consecrated  by  the  augurs,  but  not  to  any %0a%3c particular  deity.     The  places  and  circumstances  of  meeting  are  recited %0a%3c more  at  length  in  Livy,  xxvi.  10 ;  iii.  63  ;  xxxi.  47 ;  xxxiii.  22,  24 ;  xxxiv. %0a%3c 43;  xxxvi.  39;  xlii.  36.—  Wern.

As  Apis  was  held  sacred  at  Memphis,  so  another  ox  was  reve- %0a%3c renced there  under  the  name  of  Mnevis :  the  latter  dedicated  to  the  sun %0a%3c as  the  former  to  the  moon.  —  JElian,  B.  xi.  c.  11.  —  Wern.

Until  they  find  him  they  mourn  and %0a%3c shave  their  Heads.  But  they  never  are  long  before  they %0a%3c meet  with  another  :  and  when  they  have  found  him,  he  is  by %0a%3c the  Priests  brought  to  Memphis,  where  he  hath  two  Shrines %0a%3c (Delubra),  which  they  call  Thalami  (Bed-chambers),  which %0a%3c are  the  Auguries  of  the  People.  For  if  this  Ox  enter  into %0a%3c one  of  them,  it  is  a  good  Sign  ;  but  if  into  the  other,  it  por- %0a%3c tendeth  Misfortune.  He  gives  Answers  to  private  Persons  by %0a%3c taking  Meat  from  the  Hand  of  such  as  consult  him.  He %0a%3c turned  away  from  the  Hand  of  Germanicus  Ccesar,  and  not %0a%3c long  afterwards  he  died.  He  is  kept  secret  for  the  most  Part : %0a%3c but  when  he  hath  got  forth  to  the  Multitude,  he  proceeds %0a%3c with  a  Guard  of  Lictors,  and  a  Flock  of  Boys  accompany %0a%3c him,  singing  a  Hymn  to  his  Honour  :  for  he  seemeth  to %0a%3c understand,  and  is  pleased  to  be  worshipped.

[Booic  VIII, %0a%3c %0a%3c for  as  Men  are  indebted  to  the  Ox's  Labour  for  their  Food, %0a%3c so  they  owe  the  clothing  of  their  Bodies  to  the  Sheep.  They %0a%3c are  fertile  from  two  Years  of  Age  upward  to  nine,  and  some %0a%3c until  they  are  ten  Years  old.  The  first  Lambs  are  smaller %0a%3c than  the  others.  They  go  with  Young  about  the  Setting  of %0a%3c Arcturus,  that  is,  from  the  third  Day  before  the  Ides  of  May %0a%3c to  the  Setting  of  the  Eagle,  on  the  tenth  Day  before  the %0a%3c Calends  of  August.  They  are  with  Young  150  Days.  If %0a%3c any  are  conceived  after  that  Time  they  prove  weak.  Lambs %0a%3c born  after  that  Season  they  called  in  old  Time  Cordos  (later %0a%3c Lambs).  Many  prefer  these  Winter  Lambs  before  those  that %0a%3c come  in  Spring ;  because  it  is  much  better  they  should  be %0a%3c strong  before  the  Solstice  than  before  the  shortest  Days :  and %0a%3c they  think  that  this  Creature  only  is  useful  by  being  born  in %0a%3c the  midst  of  Winter.  It  is  natural  for  Rams  to  loathe  young %0a%3c Lambs,  and  to  follow  after  old  Ewes.  Himself  also  is  better %0a%3c when  old,  and  more  effective  for  them.  To  make  them  more %0a%3c gentle,  they  bore  his  Horn  through  near  his  Ear.  If  his  right %0a%3c Testicle  be  tied  up,  he  getteth  Ewe  Lambs  :  if  the  left,  Males. %0a%3c If  Ewes  be  by  themselves  when  it  thundereth,  they  cast  their %0a%3c Lambs.  The  Remedy  is  to  gather  them  together,  that  by %0a%3c Company  they  may  have  help.  They  say  that  if  the  North %0a%3c Wind  blow  they  will  conceive  Males  ;  but  if  the  Wind  be %0a%3c South,  Females.  Moreover,  great  Regard  is  had  in  this %0a%3c Kind  to  the  Mouths  of  the  Rams :  for  of  what  Colour  the %0a%3c Veins  be  under  their  Tongue,1  of  the  same  will  the  Fleece  be %0a%3c of  the  Lambs;  and  they  will  be  of  a  Variety  of  Colours  if  the %0a%3c Veins  were  so.  Also  the  Change  of  Water  arid  Drink  maketh %0a%3c them  to  alter  their  Colour.  There  are  two  principal  Kinds %0a%3c of  Sheep;  one  reared  within  House,  and  the  other  abroad  in %0a%3c the  Field  :  the  first  is  the  tenderer,  but  the  other  more  deli- %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Virgil,  Georg.  iii.  387,  in  giving  directions  to  choose  a  ram,  says, — %0a%3c %0a%3c "But  if  dark  hues  his  tongue  and  palate  stain, %0a%3c Drive  him  far  distant  from  thy  spotless  train, %0a%3c Lest  the  dim  blemish  that  the  sire  denied %0a%3c Infect  the  fleece,  and  taint  the  motley  child." %0a%3c %0a%3c —  Wern.

In  the  third  Rank %0a%3c stands  the  Milesian  Sheep.  The  Wool  of  Apulia  is  of  a  short %0a%3c Staple,  and  is  of  Reputation  for  nothing  beside  Mantles. %0a%3c About  Tarentum  and  Canusium  the  richest  of  this  Kind  are %0a%3c found  :  as  also  at  Laodicea  in  Asia.  For  Whiteness  there  is %0a%3c none  better  than  that  which  groweth  along  the  Po  ;  and  yet %0a%3c to  this  Day  a  Pound  of  it  hath  not  exceeded  the  Price  of  an %0a%3c hundred  Sesterces.  They  do  not  shear  Sheep  everywhere  ; %0a%3c for  the  Custom  of  plucking  their  Fleece  cont'mueth  still  in %0a%3c some  Places.  There  are  several  Sorts  of  Colours  in  Wool,  so %0a%3c that  we  are  not  able  to  give  distinct  Names  to  all  that  we %0a%3c call  Native.  Black  Fleeces1  are  chiefly  in  Spain;  Pollentia, %0a%3c near  the  Alps,  has  grey  ;  Asia  is  distinguished  for  red,  and %0a%3c these  Wools  are  called  Erythraese  :  in  Boeotia  the  same.  In %0a%3c Canusia  the  Colour  is  yellow  :  and  at  Tarentum  they  are %0a%3c brown.  All  Wool,  in  its  native  Grease,  is  used  in  Medicine.2 %0a%3c About  Istria  and  Liburuia  the  Fleece  resembleth  Hair  rather %0a%3c than  Wool,  and  is  not  good  to  make  Clothes  with  a  high  Nap ; %0a%3c but  serveth  only  for  the  Workman  in  Portugal,  whose  Weav- %0a%3c ing in  Net- work  with  Squares  commendeth  this  Wool.  The  like %0a%3c Wool  is  common  about  Piscenae,  in  the  Province  Narbonensis %0a%3c (Languedoc) ;  and  such  is  found  in  Egypt  :  the  Cloth  made %0a%3c of  it,  after  it  is  worn  bare,  is  dyed,  and  again  will  wear %0a%3c during  a  Man's  Life.  The  coarse,  rough  Wool,  was  in  old %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  JElian  says  that  all  the  sheep  are  black  in  Abydena,  B.  iii.  c.  32  ; %0a%3c and  Budiana,  B.  xvi.  c.  33.  In  some  soils  of  our  country  the  fleece  has  a %0a%3c strong  red  tinge,  and  on  the  granite  in  the  middle  of  Cornwall  they  are %0a%3c more  than  usually  white.  —  Wern.

But %0a%3c I  am  not  able  easily  to  say  at  what  Time  this  Workmanship %0a%3c began  :  for  in  old  Time  Men  made  their  Beds  of  Straw,  as %0a%3c now  in  the  Camp  they  use  hairy  Rugs  (Gausape).  Our %0a%3c Mantles  (Amphimalia),  shagged  without  and  within,  were %0a%3c invented  within  my  Father's  Memory;  and  also  these  downy %0a%3c Aprons  (Ventralia)  :  for  the  Tunic  of  the  Latus  Clavus, %0a%3c woven  in  the  Manner  of  the  Gausape  or  hairy  Rug,  is  now %0a%3c first  begun.

The  waved  Garment  was,  from %0a%3c the  Beginning,  among  the  most  esteemed  ;  and  from  thence %0a%3c came  the  branched  Works.  Fenestella  writeth,  that  in  the %0a%3c later  Time  of  Augustus  C&sar  they  began  to  use  shorn %0a%3c Gowns,  as  also  with  a  curled  Nap.  The  Robes  called %0a%3c Crebrse  Papaveratse2  (wrought  thick  with  Flower -work, %0a%3c resembling  Poppies,  or  pressed  smooth)  are  of  greater  Anti- %0a%3c quity ;  for  even  in  the  Time  of  Lucilius  the  Poet,  Torquatus %0a%3c was  noted  for  wearing  them.  The  Praetextse  had  their  Origin %0a%3c among  the  Etruscans.  The  Trabese  I  find  worn  by  Kings. %0a%3c In  Homer  s  Time3  they  used  painted  Garments :  and  from %0a%3c thence  came  the  triumphant  Robes.  The  Phrygians  invented %0a%3c that  which  is  wrought  with  a  Needle :  and  so  they  are  called %0a%3c Phrygiones.  And  in  Asia,  King  Attains  invented  the  work- %0a%3c ing of  Gold  into  the  same  ;  and  from  him  such  Cloths  are %0a%3c called  Attalica.  Babylon  was  much  celebrated  for  the  weav- %0a%3c ing of  Cloth  of  various  Colours  into  a  Picture,  and  Cloths  so %0a%3c wrought  were  called  Babylonica.  To  weave  with  many %0a%3c twisted  Threads  was  the  Invention  of  Alexandria,  and  these %0a%3c were  named  Polymita ;  but  Gallia  invented  the  Method  of %0a%3c dividing  the  Work  into  Shields  or  Escutcheons.

The  Babylonish  gar- %0a%3c ments of  beautiful  interwoven  colours  were  of  high  antiquity,  since  they %0a%3c proved  too  great  a  temptation  to  the  virtue  of  Achan  at  the  time  of %0a%3c Joshua's  invasion  of  Palestine.

They  go %0a%3c with  Young  five  Months,  like  Ewes.  She-Goats  become %0a%3c barren  with  Fatness.  When  three  Years  old  they  are  not  so %0a%3c good  to  breed  ;  and  when  they  are  older,  not  beyond  four %0a%3c Years  of  Age.  They  begin  at  the  seventh  Month,  even  while %0a%3c they  snck  their  Dams.  Both  Sexes  are  more  useful  if  they %0a%3c have  no  Horns.  The  first  Time  in  the  Day  that  the  she- %0a%3c Goats  go  with  the  Male  is  void :  the  second  is  more  fertile, %0a%3c and  so  forward.  They  conceive  in  the  Month  of  November, %0a%3c so  that  they  may  bring  Kids  in  March,  when  Shrubs  begin %0a%3c to  bud ;  and  this  is  sometimes  when  they  are  a  Year  old,  but %0a%3c always  at  two  Years;  and  when  three,  they  are  not  utterly %0a%3c decayed  :  for  they  are  fertile  for  eight  Years.  In  cold  Wea- %0a%3c ther they  are  liable  to  Abortion.  The  she-Goat,  when  her %0a%3c Eyes  are  overspread  with  Opacity,  pricketh  them  with  the %0a%3c Point  of  a  Rush,  and  so  letteth  them  bleed  :  but  the  Buck %0a%3c useth  the  Brier  for  the  same  Purpose.  Mutianus  reporteth  the %0a%3c Shrewdness  of  this  Creature  as  seen  by  himself,  when,  upon  a %0a%3c very  narrow  Bridge,  one  Goat  met  another  coming  opposite %0a%3c to  him  from  a  different  Direction;  now  because  the  Place  was %0a%3c so  narrow  that  they  could  not  pass  each  other,  nor  turn  about, %0a%3c nor  yet  retire  backwards  without  seeing,  considering  how %0a%3c long  and  slender  the  Plank  was,  and  also  because  the  Tor- %0a%3c rent that  ran  beneath  was  rapid  and  dangerous,  one  of  them %0a%3c lay  flat  down,  and  so  the  other  walked  over  his  Back.

But  the  Mark  to  know %0a%3c the  noblest  Females  is,  that  they  have  two  Folds  hanging  down %0a%3c along  their  Body  on  either  Side  from  the  Neck.  All  have %0a%3c not  Horns ;  but  in  those  which  are  horned,  a  Man  may  know %0a%3c their  Age  by  the  Increase  of  the  Prominences  :  and  the  un- %0a%3c horned  she-Goats  are  more  abundant  in  Milk.  Arclielaus %0a%3c writeth,  that  they  breathe  through  the  Ears,1  and  not  at  the %0a%3c Nostrils ;  and  also  that  they  are  never  without  a  Fever.  And %0a%3c this,  perhaps,  is  the  Cause  that  they  have  hotter  Breath %0a%3c than  Sheep,  and  more  eager  in  their  Love.  They  say,  also, %0a%3c that  they  see  by  Night  as  well  as  by  Day ;  and  therefore %0a%3c they  who  in  the  Evening  are  able  to  see  nothing,  which %0a%3c Disease  we  call  Nyctalipia,  recover  their  perfect  Sight  again %0a%3c by  eating  the  Liver  of  Goats.2  In  Cilicia  and  about  the %0a%3c Syrtes,  People  clothe  themselves  with  the  Goat's  Hair,  for %0a%3c there  they  shear  them.  It  is  said  that  Goats,  toward  the %0a%3c Sun-setting,  cannot  in  their  Pasture  see  directly  one  ano- %0a%3c ther, but  by  turning  Tail  to  Tail ;  but  at  other  Hours  of  the %0a%3c Day  they  keep  towards  each  other,  among  their  Fellows. %0a%3c They  have  all  of  them  a  Tuft  of  Hair  under  their  Chin, %0a%3c which  they  call  Aruncus.  If  any  one  take  one  of  them  by %0a%3c this  Beard  and  draw  it  out  of  the  Flock,  all  the  rest  will %0a%3c stand  gazing  at  it,  as  if  they  were  astonished  ;  and  so  they %0a%3c will  do  if  any  one  of  them  chance  to  eat  a  certain  Herb.3 %0a%3c Their  Bite  is  destructive  to  Trees.

They  farrow  twice  a  Year; %0a%3c they  go  with  Young  four  Months.  One  Sow  may  bring  at %0a%3c a  Farrow  to  the  Number  of  twenty  Pigs  ;  but  she  cannot  rear %0a%3c so  many.  Nugidius  saith,  that  those  Pigs  which  are  farrowed %0a%3c on  the  ten  Days  about  the  shortest  Day  of  the  Year,  are %0a%3c born  with  Teeth.  They  are  fertile  at  one  coupling,  but  be- %0a%3c cause they  are  subject  to  Abortion  it  requires  to  be  repeated. %0a%3c The  Way  to  prevent  Abortion  is  to  keep  them  asunder  at %0a%3c their  first  seeking,  and  before  their  Ears  hang  down.  The %0a%3c Males  are  not  fertile  after  three  Years  old.  Sows,  when  they %0a%3c are  feeble  for  Age,  are  rendered  fertile  as  they  lie  along. %0a%3c That  a  Sow  should  eat  her  own  Pigs  is  not  a  Prodigy.  A %0a%3c young  Pig  is  pure  for  Sacrifice  five  Days  after  it  is  farrowed ; %0a%3c a  Lamb  at  eight  Days;  and  a  Calf  at  thirty  Days.  But %0a%3c Coruncanus  denieth  that  Beasts  which  chew  the  Cud  are %0a%3c pure  for  Sacrifice  until  they  have  two  Teeth.  Swine  that %0a%3c have  lost  one  Eye  are  not  thought  to  live  long  after ;  other- %0a%3c wise they  may  continue  until  they  are  fifteen  Years  old,  and %0a%3c some  to  twenty.  But  they  grow  outrageous,  and  subject  to %0a%3c many  other  Kinds  of  Diseases,  especially  the  Quinsy  and %0a%3c Scrofula.  A  Mark  to  show  that  Swine  are  sick  is  to  pluck %0a%3c a  Bristle  from  the  Back,  and  it  will  be  found  bloody  at  the %0a%3c Root :  also  he  will  carry  his  Head  with  a  Twist  as  he  goeth. %0a%3c An  overfat  Sow  soon  wanteth  Milk ;  and  at  her  first  Farrow %0a%3c bringeth  fewest  Pigs.  All  the  Kind  of  them  love  to  wallow %0a%3c in  the  Mire.  They  twist  their  Tails ;  wherein  this  also  is %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Sus  scrofa.  —  LINN.     The  Uog.  —  Wern.

Swine  will  be  fat  in  sixty  Days ;  and  the  rather  if,  be- %0a%3c fore you  set  them  up  for  feeding,  they  be  kept  fasting  for %0a%3c three  Days.  Of  all  other  Animals  they  are  the  most  brutish; %0a%3c so  that  there  goeth  a  witty  saying  of  them,  That  their  Life  is %0a%3c given  them  instead  of  Salt.1  It  is  known  that  when  Thieves %0a%3c had  driven  away  a  Company  of  them,  on  hearing  the  Voice %0a%3c 'of  the  Swineherd  they  leaned  all  to  one  Side  of  the  Vessel, %0a%3c and  sunk  it,  and  then  returned  to  their  Keeper.  Moreover, %0a%3c the  Hogs  that  lead  the  Herd  are  so  well  trained,  that  they %0a%3c will  of  themselves  go  to  the  Swine  Market-place,  and  from %0a%3c thence  Home  again ;  and  the  Wild  ones  have  the  Wit  to %0a%3c confound  the  Prints  of  their  Feet,  in  the  marshy  Ground, %0a%3c and  to  render  their  Flight  more  easy  by  first  voiding  their %0a%3c Urine.2  Sows  also  are  spayed  as  Camels  are ;  but  two  Days %0a%3c before,  they  are  kept  from  Meat :  then  they  hang  them  by %0a%3c the  Forelegs  to  make  Incision  into  the  Part;  and  by  this %0a%3c means  they  grow  to  Fat  sooner.  There  is  an  Art  also  to %0a%3c prepare  the  Liver  of  a  Sow,  as  also  of  a  Goose,3  which  was %0a%3c the  Invention  of  M.  Apicius*  by  feeding  them  with  dry %0a%3c Figs,  and  when  they  have  eaten  till  they  are  full,  presently %0a%3c to  kill  them  with  a  Drink  of  Water,  Wine,  and  Honey %0a%3c (Mulsus).5  There  is  not  the  Flesh  of  any  other  living  Crea- %0a%3c ture that  affordeth  more  Matter  for  Gluttony  :  for  there  are %0a%3c nearly  fifty  Sorts  of  Tastes,  whereas  others  have  but  one %0a%3c each.  From  hence  came  so  many  Books  of  Laws  by  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Cicero  ("  De  Nat.

And  not  in  Swine  only,  but %0a%3c also  in  all  other  Creatures,  of  whatever  Kind  there  is  any %0a%3c one  tame,  you  may  find  also  the  wild  of  the  same  Kind ;  and %0a%3c even  of  Men  there  may  be  said  to  be  so  many  wild  Kinds. %0a%3c As  for  the  Goats,  they  are  changed  into  a  variety  of  Forms.1 %0a%3c There  are  (Caproe)  Roes,2  (Rupicaprse)  the  Shamois,3  the %0a%3c wild  Goat  (Ibex),4  of  wonderful  Swiftness,  although  his  Head %0a%3c is  loaded  with  very  large  Horns  like  Scabbards  for  Swords  ; %0a%3c by  these  they  poise  themselves  when  they  swing  round  as  by %0a%3c a  Rope  from  one  Rock  to  another ;  and  chiefly  when  they %0a%3c endeavour  to  skip  along  from  one  Mountain  to  another,  and %0a%3c fetch  a  Leap  to  what  Place  they  please  with  a  rapid  Spring. %0a%3c Of  this  kind  are  the  Oryges,5  the  only  Beasts,  as  some  say, %0a%3c that  have  their  Hair  growing  reversed,  and  turning  toward %0a%3c the  Head.  To  these  belong  the  (Damae)  Does,6  and  Py- %0a%3c gargi;7  as  also  Strepsicerotes,8  and  many  others  much  like. %0a%3c %0a%3c passing  through  the  skin  of  the  snout,  and  curving  round  over  the %0a%3c forehead,  so  as  to  protect  the  head  and  eyes,  render  it  applicable  to %0a%3c Pliny's  description  of  the  wild  boar  of  India.  —  Wern.

Mutianus  saith,  that  they %0a%3c have  played  at  Chess;  and  that  at  first  Sight  they  knew  Nuts %0a%3c made  of  Wax  from  others ;  that  when  the  Moon  is  in  the %0a%3c wane  those  Kinds  which  have  Tails  are  sad,  but  the  new %0a%3c Moon  they  adore  with  Skipping  for  Joy  :  for  the  Eclipse  of %0a%3c Sun  or  Moon  these  and  all  other  four-footed  Creatures %0a%3c greatly  dread.  Monkeys  of  all  Sorts  are  very  fond  of  their %0a%3c Young  Ones ;  and  those  which  are  kept  tame  in  Houses  will %0a%3c display  them  to  every  one  as  soon  as  they  are  born,  carrying %0a%3c them  about :  they  also  take  Pleasure  to  have  them  dandled,  as %0a%3c if  they  understood  it  to  imply  Congratulation,  and  in  this  Way %0a%3c they  generally  end  in  killing  them  by  their  Embraces.  The %0a%3c Nature  of  the  Cynocephali2  is  the  most  savage ;  as  that  of  the %0a%3c Sphinges  and  Satyri  is  the  most  gentle.

Of  the  Hare  kind  are  they  also %0a%3c which  in  Spain  they  call  (Cuniculi2)  Rabbits,  which  are  ex- %0a%3c ceedingly fruitful ;  so  that  having  devoured  all  the  Corn  in %0a%3c the  Field  before  Harvest  in  the  Balearic  Islands,  they %0a%3c brought  thereby  a  Famine  on  the  People.  There  is  a  very %0a%3c dainty  Dish  at  Table  made  of  the  young,  either  cut  out  of %0a%3c the  Dam's  Belly,  or  taken  from  them  when  they  are  suck- %0a%3c ing, without  cleansing  their  Entrails :  and  they  call  it  Lau- %0a%3c rices.  It  is  certain  that  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Balearic %0a%3c Islands  made  a  Petition  to  Divus  Augustus  Ccesar  for  mili- %0a%3c tary Aid  to  destroy  the  great  Increase  of  these  Creatures %0a%3c among  them.  Ferrets3  are  a  favourite  Resource  for  hunt- %0a%3c ing them.  They  put  them  into  their  Holes,  which  within %0a%3c the  Ground  have  many  Passages  (from  whence  these  Crea- %0a%3c tures are  called  Cuniculi} :  and  when  they  are  driven  out %0a%3c of  their  Earth  they  are  soon  taken.

And  that  these  parks  were  named  Leporaria, %0a%3c because  three  sorts  of  hares  were  reared  in  them  ;  the  common  hare,  the %0a%3c original  Spanish  rabbit,  and  the  variegated  or  alpine  hare,  a  species  now %0a%3c almost  entirely  destroyed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  flesh  of  the  hare  was  highly  valued :  Martial  says  (Xenia,  87) : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Inter  aves  turdus,  siquis  me  Judice  certet, %0a%3c Inter  Quadrupedes  gloria  prima  Lepus."  — Wern.

The  same  Writer  says,  that  every  Hare  is  in  posses- %0a%3c sion of  a  double  Faculty,  and  can  breed  without  the  Buck. %0a%3c Herein  Nature  hath  showed  her  Bounty,  that  so  harmless  an %0a%3c Animal,  and  so  good  to  eat,  should  produce  so  abundantly. %0a%3c The  Hare  is  naturally  exposed  to  be  a  Prey  to  all ;  it  is  the %0a%3c only  Creature,  except  the  Dasypus,1  which  superfoetates  ;  so %0a%3c that  she  hath  one  sucking  her ;  another  within  her,  covered %0a%3c with  Hair ;  another  is  naked  ;  and  another  scarcely  well- %0a%3c shaped  :  all  in  the  Womb  together.  An  Attempt  has  been %0a%3c made  to  make  Cloth  of  Hare's  Fur ;  but  to  the  Touch  they %0a%3c are  not  so  soft  as  upon  the  Skin ;  and  the  Hair  is  soon  shed, %0a%3c because  of  its  shortness. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVI. %0a%3c Of  Beasts  half  tame. %0a%3c %0a%3c HARES  are  seldom  rendered  tame ;  and  yet  they  cannot %0a%3c rightly  be  called  wild.  For  many  other  Creatures  there  are %0a%3c that  are  neither  wild  nor  gentle,  but  of  a  middle  Nature  be- %0a%3c tween both.  Such  is  among  Birds,  Swallows,  Bees;  and  in %0a%3c the  Sea,  Dolphins. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVII. %0a%3c Of  Mice*  and  Dormice. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  the  Class  of  those  which  are  neither  tame  nor  wild, %0a%3c many  have  arranged  the  Mice  that  haunt  our  Houses :  a %0a%3c Creature  not  to  be  despised  in  considering  public  Prodigies. %0a%3c By  gnawing  the  silver  Shields3  at  Lavinium,  they  portended %0a%3c the  Marsian  War.

There  are  many  kinds  of %0a%3c them  in  the  Country  of  Cyrerie :  some  with  a  broad  Fore- %0a%3c head, others  with  a  sharp-pointed  ;  and  some  with  sharp %0a%3c Bristles,  like  Hedgehogs.  Theophrastus  reporteth,  that  they %0a%3c drove  away  the  Inhabitants  of  the  Island  Gyaros,  and %0a%3c gnawed  even  the  Iron  :  a  Thing  which  it  seems  their %0a%3c Nature  to  do ;  for  among  the  Chalybes  they  eat  the  Iron  in %0a%3c the  Smiths'  Workshops ;  and,  indeed,  in  Gold  Mines1  on %0a%3c this  Account  they  cut  open  their  Bowels,  and  so  they  always %0a%3c find  their  stolen  Goods  again  :  such  Delight  this  Creature %0a%3c taketh  in  thieving.  We  read  in  the  Chronicles,  that  when %0a%3c Annibal  besieged  Casilinum,  a  Mouse  (Murem)  was  sold %0a%3c for  two  hundred  Sesterces ;  and  the  Man  who  bought  it %0a%3c lived,  but  he  that  sold  it  died  for  Hunger.  If  white  ones %0a%3c abound,  it  presageth  Prosperity.  Our  Annals  are  full  of %0a%3c Instances,  that  when  Rats  (Sorices)  are  heard  to  squeak %0a%3c the  Auspices  are  broken  off.  Nigidius  saith,  that  Rats  also %0a%3c lie  hid  in  Winter,  like  Dormice2  (Glires).  By  the  Laws  of %0a%3c the  Censors,  and  principally  by  an  Act  of  M.  Scaurus,  in  his %0a%3c Consulship,  it  was  provided  that  these  should  be  kept  away %0a%3c from  Suppers  in  no  other  Manner  than  were  Shell-fish,  or %0a%3c Birds  brought  from  foreign  Countries.  The  Dormouse  is  a %0a%3c half-  wild  Creature  ;  and  he  who  first  contrived  to  keep %0a%3c Boars  in  Parks,  also  fed  these  Animals  in  Tubs.  In  which %0a%3c Practice  it  hath  been  observed,  that  these  little  Creatures %0a%3c will  not  associate  unless  they  were  Inhabitants  of  the  same %0a%3c Wood ;  and  if  there  be  mingled  among  them  any  Strangers, %0a%3c such  as  had  some  River  or  Mountain  between  the  Places %0a%3c where  they  were  bred,  they  kill  one  another  with  fighting. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Livy  tells  us,  Lib.  xxviii.  23,  that  at  Cumse  mice  gnawed  some  gold %0a%3c in  the  temple  of  Jupiter ;  and  again,  Lib.  xxx.  2,  that  at  Antium  some %0a%3c mice  gnawed  a  golden  crown.  — Wern.

In  the  Forest  of %0a%3c Moesia  in  Italy,  these  Dormice  are  found  only  in  one  Part. %0a%3c In  Lycia,  Roebucks1  never  pass  the  Mountains  that  border %0a%3c on  the  Syrians ;  nor  do  the  wild  Asses  that  Mountain  which %0a%3c divideth  Cappadocia  from  Cilicia.  Within  Hellespont  the %0a%3c Stags  never  wander  away  into  the  Borders  of  other  Coun- %0a%3c tries ;  and  those  which  are  about  Arginussa  do  not  pass  be- %0a%3c yond the  Mountain  Elatus;  which  may  be  known  by  the %0a%3c Fact,  that  all  upon  that  Mountain  have  their  Ears  divided. %0a%3c In  the  Island  Poroselenum,  the  Weazels  do  not  cross  over %0a%3c the  Highway.  And  about  Lebadia  in  Bceotia,  those  Moles %0a%3c which  are  brought  thither  from  other  Parts  fly  from  the %0a%3c very  Soil ;  although  near  by,  in  Orchomenus,  they  under- %0a%3c mine all  the  Corn-fields  ;  and  I  have  seen  all  the  Bed- %0a%3c clothing  made  of  their  Skins.

So,  in  Syria,  there  are  Snakes, %0a%3c especially  along  the  Banks  of  the  Euphrates,  that  do  not %0a%3c touch  the  Syrians  while  l}ing  asleep;  and  even  if  a  Native %0a%3c treads  upon  them  and  receives  a  Bite,  he  does  not  receive %0a%3c any  Hurt ;  but  to  the  People  of  any  other  Nation  they  are %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Sorex  araneus.  —  LINN.

The  bite,  he  says, %0a%3c causes  boils,  and  these  burst,  if  the  Shrew-mouse  be  pregnant  when  she %0a%3c inflicts  the  wound ;  but  if  she  be  not,  they  do  not  burst. — "  Hist.
