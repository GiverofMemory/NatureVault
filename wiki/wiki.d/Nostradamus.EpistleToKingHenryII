text=I have calculated and composed all during choice hours of well-disposed days, and as accurately%0aas I could, all when Minerva was free and not unfavorable. I have made computations for events%0aover almost as long a period to come as that which has already passed, and by these they will%0aknow in all regions what is to happen in the course of time, just as it is written, with nothing%0asuperfluous added, although some may say, There can be no truth entirely determined%0aconcerning the future.%0a%0aIt is quite true, Sire, that my natural instinct has been inherited from my forebears, who did not%0abelieve in predicting, and that this is natural instinct has been adjusted and integrated with long%0acalculations. At the same time, I freed my soul, mind and heart of all care, solicitude and%0avexation. All of these prerequisites for presaging I achieved in part by means of the brazen%0atripod.%0a%0aThere are some who would attribute to me that which is not mine at all. The eternal God alone,%0awho is the thorough searcher of humane hearts, pious, just and merciful, is the true judge, and it%0ais to him I pray to defend me from the calumny of evil men. These evil ones, in their slanderous%0away, would likewise want to inquire how all your most ancient progenitors, the Kings of France,%0ahave cured the scrofula, how those of other nations have cured the bite of snakes, how those of%0ayet other nations have had a certain instinct for the art of divination and still others which would%0abe too long to recite here.%0a%0aNotwithstanding those who cannot contain the malignity of the evil spirit, as time elapses after%0amy death, my writings will have more weight than during my lifetime. Should I, however, have%0amade any errors in my calculation of dates, or prove unable to please everybody, I beg that your%0amore than Imperial Majesty will forgive me. I protest before God and his Saints that I do not%0apropose to insert any writings in this present Epistle that will be contrary to the true Catholic%0afaith, whilst consulting the astronomical calculations to the best of my abilty.%0aSuch is the extent of time past, subject to correction by the most learned judgment, that the first%0aman, Adam, came 1,242 years before Noah ( not reckoning by such Gentile calculations as Varro%0aused, but simply by the Holy Scriptures, as best my weak understanding and astronomical calcu-%0alations can interpret them.) About 1,080 years after Noah and the universal flood came Abraham,%0awho, according to some, was a first-rate astrologer and invented the Chaldean alphabet. About%0a515 or 516 years later came Moses, and from his time to that of David about 570 years%0aelapsed. From the time of David to that of out Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, born of the%0aunique Virgin, 1,350 year elapsed, according to some chronographs. Some may object that this%0acalculation cannot be true, because it differs from that of Eusebius. From the timeof the human%0aredemption to the detestable heresy of the Saracens about 621 years elapsed. From this one can%0aeasily add up the amount of time gone by.%0a%0aAlthough my calculations may not hold good for all nations, they have, however, been%0adetermined by the celestial movements, combined with the emotion, handed down to me by my%0aforebears, which comes over me at certain hours. But the danger of the times, O Most Serene%0aKing, requires that such secrets should not be bared except in enigmatic sentences having,%0ahowever, only one sense and meaning, and nothing ambiguous or amphibological inserted.%0aRather they are under a cloudy obscurity, with a natural infusion not unloke the creation of the%0aworld, according to the calculation and Punic Chronicle of Joel: I will pour out my spirit upon all%0aflesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy. But such Prophecy proceeded from the mouth%0aof the Holy Ghost who was the sovereign and eternal power, together with the heavens, and%0acaused some of them to predict great and marvelous events.%0aAs for myself, I would never claim such a title, never, please God. I readily admit that all%0aproceeds from God and render to Him thanks, honor and immortal praise. I have mixed therewith%0ano divination coming from fate. All from God and nature, and for the most part integrated with%0acelestial movements. It is much like seeing in a burning mirror, with clouded vision, the great%0aevents, sad, prodigious and calamitous events that in due time will fall upon the principal%0aworshippers. First, upon the temples of God; secondly, upon those who, sustained by the earth,%0aapproach such a decadence. Also a thousand other calamitous events which will be known to%0ahappen in due time.%0a%0aFor God will take notice of the long barrenness of the great dame, who thereupon will conceive%0atwo principal children. But she will be in danger, and the female to whom she will have given%0abirth will also, because of the temerity of the age, be in danger of death in her eighteenth year,%0aand will be unable to live beyond her thirty-sixth year. She will leave three males, and one%0afemale, and of these two will not have had the same father.%0aThere will be great differences between the three brothers, and then there will be such great co-%0aoperation and agreement between them that the three and four parts of Europe will tremble. The%0ayoungest of them will sus- tain and augment the Christian monarchy, and under him sects will be%0aelevated, and suddenly cast down, Arabs will be driven back, kingdoms united and new laws%0apromulgated.%0a%0aThe oldest one will rule the land whose escutcheon is that of the furious crowned lions with their%0apaws resting upon intrepid arms.%0a%0aThe one second in age, accompanied by the Latins, will penetrate far, until a second furious and%0atrembling path has been beaten to the Great St. Bernard Pass. From there he will descend to%0amount the Pyrenees, which will not, however, be transferred to the French crown. And this third%0aone will cause a great inundation of human blood, and for a long time Lent will not include%0aMarch.%0a%0aThe daughter will be given for the preservation of the Christian Church. Her lord will fall into%0athe pagan sect of the new infidels. Of her two children, one will be faithful to the Catholic%0aChurch, the other an infidel.%0a%0aThe unfaithful son, who, to his great confusion and later repentance, will want to ruin her, will%0ahave three widely scattered regions, namely, the Roman, Germany and Spain, which will set up%0adiverse sects by armed force. The 50th to the 52th degree of latitude will be left behind.%0aAnd all will render the homage of ancient religions to the region of Europe north of the 48th%0aparallel. The latter will have trembled first in vain timidity but afterwards the regions to its west,%0asouth and east will tremble. But the nature of their power will be such that what has been brought%0aabout by concord and union will prove insuperable by warlike conquests.%0aIn nature they will be equal, but very different in faith.%0a%0aAfter this the barren Dame, of greater power than the second, will be received by two of the%0anations. First, by them made obstinate by the onetime masters of the universe. Second, by the%0alatter themselves.%0a%0aThe third people will extend their forces towards the circuit of the East of Europe where, in the%0aPannonias, they will be overwhelmed and slaughtered. By sea they will extend their Myrmidons%0aand Germans to Adriatic Sicily. But they will succumb wholly and the Barbarian sect will be%0agreatly afflicted and driven out by all the Latins.%0a%0aThen the great Empire of the Antichrist will begin where once was Attila's empire and the new%0aXerxes will descend with great and countless numbers, so that the coming of the Holy Ghost,%0aproceeding from the 48th degree, will make a transmigration, chasing out the abomination of the%0aChristian Church, and whose reign will be for a time and to the end of time.%0aThis will be preceded by a solar eclipse more dark and gloomy than any since the creation of the%0aworld, except that after the death and passion of Jesus Christ. And it will be in the month of%0aOctober than the great translation will be made and it will be such that one will think the gravity%0aof the earth has lost its natural movement and that it is to be plunged into the abyss of perpetual%0adarkness.%0a%0aIn the spring there will be omens, and thereafter extreme changes, reversals of realms and mighty%0aearthquakes. These will be accompanied by the procreation of the new Babylon, miserable%0adaughter enlarged by the abomination of the first holocaust. It will last for only seventy-three%0ayears and seven months.%0a%0aThen there will issue from the stock which had remained barren for so long, proceeding from the%0a50th degree, one who will renew the whole Christian Church. A great place will be established,%0awith union and concord between some of the children of opposite ideas, who have been%0aseperated by diverse realms. And such will be the peace that the instigator and promoter of%0amilitary factions, born of the diversity of religions, will remain chained to the deepest pit. And%0athe kingdom of the Furious One, who counterfeits the sage, will be united.%0aThe countries, towns, cities, realms and provinces which will have abandoned their old customs%0ato gain liberty, but which will in fact have enthralled themselves even more, will secretly have%0awearied of their liberty. Faith lost in their perfect religion, they will begin to strike to the left,%0aonly to return to the right. Holiness, for a long time overcome, will be replaced in accordance%0awith the earliest writings.%0a%0aThereafter the great dog, the biggest of curs, will go forth and destroy all, the same old crimes%0abeing perpetrated again. Temples will be set up again as in ancient times, and the priest will be%0arestored to his original position and he will begin his whoring and luxury, and will commit a%0athousand crimes.%0a%0aAt the eve of another desolation, when she is atop her most high and sublime dignity, some%0apotentates and warlords will confront her, and take away her two swords, and leave her only the%0ainsignia, whose curvature attracts them. The people will make him go to the right and will not%0awish to submit themselves to those of the opposite extreme with the hand in acute position, who%0atouch the ground, and want to drive spurs into them.%0a%0aAnd hereupon it is that there is born of a branch long sterila one who will deliver the people of%0athe world from this benevolent slavery to which they had voluntary submitted. He will put%0ahimself under the protection of Mars, stripping Jupiter of all his honors and dignities, and%0aestablish himself in the free city in another scant Mesopotamia. The chief and governor will be%0acast out from the middle and hung up, ignorant of the conspiracy of one of the%0aconspirators with the second Thrasibulus, who for a long time will have directed all this.%0aThen the impurities and abominations, with a great shame, will be brought out and manifested in%0athe shadows of the veiled light, and will cease towards the end of the change in reign. The chiefs%0aof the Church will be backward in the love of God, and several of them will apostatize from the%0atrue faith. Of the three sects, that which is in the middle, because of its own partisans, will be%0athrown a bit into decadence. The first one will be exterminated throughout all Europe and most%0aof Africa by the third one, making use of the poor in spirit who, led by madmen to libidinous%0aluxury, will adulterate.%0a%0aThe supporting common people will rise up and chase out the adherents of the legislators. From%0athe way realms will have been weakened by the Easterners, it will seem that God the Creator has%0aloosed Satan from the prisons of hell to give birth to the great Dog and Doham, who will make%0asuch an abominable breach in the Churches that neither the reds nor the whites without eyes or%0ahands will know what to make of it, and their power will be taken from them.%0a%0aThen will commence a persecution of the Churches the like of which was never seen.%0aMeanwhile, such a plague will arise that more than two thirds of the world will be removed. One%0awill be unable to ascertain the true owners of fields and houses, and weeds growing in the streets%0aof cities will rise higher than the knees. For the clergy there will be but utter desolation. The%0awarlords will usurp what is returned from the City of the Sun, from Malta and the Isles of%0aHyères. The great chain of the port which wakes its name from the marine ox will be opened.%0aAnd a new incursion will be made by the maritime shores, wishing to deliver the Sierra More¤a%0afrom the first Mahometan recapture. Their assaults will not all be in vain, and the place which%0awas once the abode of Abraham will be assaulted by persons who hold the Jovialists in%0aveneration. And this city of "Achem" will be surrounded and assailed on all sides by a most%0apowerful force of warriors. Their maritime forces will be weakened by the Westerners, and great%0adesolation will fall upon this realm. Its greatest cities will be depopulated and those who enter%0awill fall under the vengeance of the wrath of God.%0a%0aThe sepulchre, for long an object of such great veneration, will remain in the open, exposed to%0athe sight of the heavens, the Sun and the Moon. The holy place will be converted into a stable for%0aa herd large and small, and used for profane purposes. Oh, what a calamitous affliction will%0apregnant women bear at this time.%0a%0aFor hereupon the principal Eastern chief will be vanquished by the Northerners and Westerners,%0aand most of his people, stirred up, will be put to death, overwhelmed or scattered. His children,%0aoffspring of many women, will be imprisoned. Then will be accomplished the prophecy of the%0aRoyal Prophet, Let him hear the groaning of the captives, that he might deliver the children of%0athose doomed to die.%0a%0aWhat great oppression will then fall upon the Princes and Governors of Kingdoms, especially%0athose which will be maritime and Eastern, whose tongues will be intermingled with all others:%0athe tongue of the Latins, and of the Arabs, via the Phoenicians. And all these Eastern Kings will%0abe chased, overthrown and exterminated, but not altogether, by means of the forces of the Kings%0aof the North, and because of the drawing near of our age through the three secretly united in the%0asearch for death, treacherously laying traps for one another. This renewed Triumvirate will last%0afor seven years, and the renown of this sect will extend arount the world. The sacrifice of the%0ahole and immaculate Wafer will be sustained.%0a%0aThen the Lords of "Aquilon" [the North], two in number, will be victorious over the Easterners,%0aand so great a noise and bellicose tumult will they make amongst them that all the East will%0atremble in terror of these brothers, yet not brothers, of "Aquilon" [the North].%0a%0aBy this discourse, Sire, I present these predictions almost with confusion, especially as to when%0athey will take place. Furthermore, the chronology of time which follows conforms very little, if%0aat all, with that which has already been set forth. Yet it was determined by astronomy and other%0asources, including Holy Scriptures, and thus could not err. If I had wanted to date each quatrain,%0aI could have done so. But this would not have been agreeable to all, least of all to those%0ainterpreting them, and was not to be done until Your Majesty granted me full power to do so, lest%0acalumniators be furnished with an opportunity to injure me.%0a%0aAnyhow, I count the years from the creation of the world to the birth of Noah as 1,506, and from%0athe birth of Noah to the completion of the Ark, at the time of the universal deluge, as 600 ( let the%0ayears be solar, or lunar, or a mixture of the ten ) I hold that the Sacred Scriptures use solar years.%0aAnd at the end of these 600 years, Noah enetered the Ark to be saved from the deluge. This%0adeluge was universal, and lasted one year and two months. And 295 years elapsed from the end%0aof the flood to the birth of Abraham, and 100 from then till the birth of Isaac. And 60 years later%0aJacob was born. 130 years elapsed between the time he entered Egypt and the time he came out.%0aBetween the entry of Jacob into Egypt and the exodus, 430 years passed. From the exodus to the%0abuilding of the Temple by Solomon in the fourth year of his reign, 480 yearss. According ot the%0acalculations of the Sacred Writings, it was 490 years from the building of the Temple to the time%0aof Jesus Christ. Thus, this calculation of mine, collected from the holy writ, comes to about%0a4,173 years and 8 months, more or less. Because there is such a diversity of sects, I will not go%0abeyond Jesus Christ.%0a%0aI have calculated the present prophecies according to the order of the chain which contains its%0arevolution, all by astronomical doctrine modified by my natural instinct. After a while, I found%0athe time when Saturn turns to enter on April 7 till August 25, Jupiter on June 14 till October 7,%0aMars from April 17 to June 22, Venus from April 9 to May 22, Mercury from February 3 to%0aFebruary 24. After that, from June 1 to June 24, and from September 25 to October 16, Saturn in%0aCapricorn, Jupiter in Aquarius, Mars in Scorpio, Venus in Pisces, Mercury for a month in%0aCapricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, the Moon in Aquarius, the Dragon's head in Libra: its tail in%0aopposition following a conjunction of Jupiter and Mercury with a quadrature of Mars and%0aMercury, and the Dragon's head coinciding with a conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter. And the%0ayear without an eclipse peaceful.%0a%0aBut not everywhere. It will mark the commencement of what will long endure. For beginning%0awith this year the Christian Church will be persecuted more fiercely than it ever was in Africa,%0aand this will last up to the year 1792, which they will believe to mark a renewal of time.%0aAfter this the Roman people will begin to re-establish themselves, chasing away some obscure%0ashadows and recovering a bit of their ancient glory. But this will not be without great division%0aand continual changes. Thereafter Venice will raise its wings very high in great force and power,%0anot far short of the might of ancient Rome.%0a%0aAt that time the great sails of Byzantium, allied with the Ligurians and through the support and%0apower of "Aquilon" [the Northern Realm], will impede them so greatly that the two Cretans will%0abe unable to maintain their faith. The arks built by the Warriors of ancient times will accompany%0athem to the waves of Neptune. In the Adriatic great discord will arise, and that which will have%0abeen united will be seperated. To a house will be reduced that which was, and is, a great city,%0aincluding "Pampotamia" and "Mesopotamia" of Europe at 45, and others of 41, 42 and 37%0adegrees.%0a%0aIt will be at this time and in these countries that the infernal power will set the power of its%0aadversaries against the Church of Jesus Christ. This will constitute of the second Antichrist, who%0awill persecute that Church and its true Vicar, by means of the power of three temporal kings who%0ain their ignorance will be seduced by tongues which, in the hands of the madmen, will cut more%0athan any sword.%0a%0aThe said reign of the Antichrist will last only to the death of him who was born at the beginning%0aof the age and of the other one of Lyon, associated with the elected one of the House of Modena%0aand of Ferrara, maintained by the Adriatic Ligurians and the proximity of great Sicily. Then the%0aGreat St. Bernard will be passed.%0a%0aThe Gallic Ogmios will be accompanied by so great a number that the Empire of his great law%0awill extend very far. For some time thereafter the blood of the Innocent will be shed profusely by%0athe recently elevated guilty ones. Then, because of great floods, the memory of things contained%0ain these instruments will suffer incalculable loss, even letters. This will happen to the%0a"Aquiloners" [the Northern People] by the will of God.%0a%0aOnce again Satan will be bound, universal peace will be established among men, and the Church%0aof Jesus Christ will be delivered from all tribulations, although the Philistines would like to mix%0ain the honey of malice and their pestilent seduction. This will be near the seventh millenary,%0awhen the sanctuary of Jesus Christ will no longer be throdden down by the infidels who come%0afrom "Aquilon" [the North]. The world will be approaching a great conflagration, although,%0aaccording to my calculations in my prophecies, the course of time runs much further.%0aIn the Epistle that some years ago I dedicated to my son, César Nostradamus, I declared some%0apoints openly enough, without presage. But here, Sire, are included several great and marvelous%0aevents which those to come after will see.%0a%0aDuring this astrological supputation, harmonized with the Holy Scriptures, the persecution of the%0aEcclesiastical folk will have its origin in the power of the Kings of "Aquilon" [the North], united%0awith the Easterners. This persecution will last for eleven years, or somewhat less, for then the%0achief King of "Aquilon" will fall.%0a%0aThereupon the same thing will occur in the South, where for the space of three years the Church%0apeople will be persecuted even more fiercely through the Apostatic seduction of one who will%0ahold all the absolute power in the Church militant. The hole people of God, the observer of his%0alaw, will be persecuted fiercely and such will be their affliction that the blood of the true%0aEcclesiastics will flow everywhere.%0a%0aOne of the horrible temporal Kings will be told by his adherents, as the ultimate in praise, that he%0ahas shed more of human blood of Innocent Ecclesiastics than anyone else could have spilled of%0awine. This King will commit incredible crimes against the Church. Human blood will flow in the%0apublic streets and temples, like water after an impetuous rain, coloring the nearby rivers red with%0ablood. The ocean itself will be reddened by another naval battle, such that one king will say to%0aanother, Naval battles have caused the sea to blush.%0a%0aThen, in this same year, and in those following, there will ensue the most horrible pestilence,%0amade more stupendous by the famine which will have preceded it. Such great tribulations will%0anever have occurred since the first foundation of the Christian Church. It will cover all Latin%0aregions, and will leave traces in some countries of the Spanish.%0a%0aThereupon the third King of "Aquilon" [the North], hearing the lament of the people of his%0aprincipal title, will raise a very mighty army and, defying the tradition of his predecessors, will%0aput almost everything back in its proper place, and the great Vicar of the hood will be put back in%0ahis former state. But desolated, and then abandoned by all, he will turn to find the Holy of Holies%0adestroyed by paganism, and the old and new Testaments thrown out and burned.%0a%0aAfter that Antichrist will be the infernal prince again, for the last time. All the Kingdoms of%0aChristianity will tremble, even those of the infidels, for the space of twenty-five years. Wars and%0abattles will be more grievous and towns, cities, castles and all other edifices will be burned,%0adesolated and destroyed, with great effusion of vestal blood, violations of married woman and%0awidows, and sucking children dashed and broken against the walls of towns. By means of Satan,%0aPrince Infernal, so may evils will be commited that nearly all the world will find itself undone%0aand desolated. Before these events, some rare birds will cry in the air: Hui, Hui [Today, today]%0aand some time later will vanish.%0a%0aAfter this has endured for a long time, there will be almost renewed another reign of Saturn, and%0agolden age. Hearing the affliction of his people, God the Creator will command that Satan be%0acast into the depths of the bottomless pit, and bound there. Then a universal peace will%0acommence between God and man, and Satan will remain bound for around a thousand years, and%0athen all unbound.%0a%0aAll these figures represent the just integration of Holy Scriptures with visible celestial bodies,%0anamely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and others conjoined, as can be seen at more length in some of the%0aquatrains. I would have calculated more profoundly and integrated them even further, Most%0aSerene King, but for the fact that some given to censure would raise difficulties. Therefore I%0awithdraw my pen and seek nocturnal repose.%0a%0aMany events, most powerful of all Kings, of the most astounding sort are to transpire soon, but I%0aneither could nor would fit them all into this epistle; but in order to comprehend certain horrible%0afacts, a few must be set forth. So great is your grandeur and humanity before men, and your piety%0abefore the gods, that you alone seem worthy of the great title of the Most Christian King, and to%0awhom the highest authority in all religion should be deferred.%0a%0aBut I shall only beseech you, Most Clement King, by this singular and prudent humanity of%0ayours, to understand rather the desire of my heart, and the sovereign wish I have to obey Your%0aMost Serene Majesty, ever since my eyes approached your solar splendour, than the grandeur of%0amy labor can attain to or acquire.%0a%0aFrom Salon, this 27th of June, 1558.%0a%0aDone by Michel Nostradamus at Salon-de-Crau in Provence.

She will leave three males, and one%0a%3c female, and of these two will not have had the same father.%0a%3c There will be great differences between the three brothers, and then there will be such great co-%0a%3c operation and agreement between them that the three and four parts of Europe will tremble. The%0a%3c youngest of them will sus- tain and augment the Christian monarchy, and under him sects will be%0a%3c elevated, and suddenly cast down, Arabs will be driven back, kingdoms united and new laws%0a%3c promulgated.%0a%3c %0a%3c The oldest one will rule the land whose escutcheon is that of the furious crowned lions with their%0a%3c paws resting upon intrepid arms.%0a%3c %0a%3c The one second in age, accompanied by the Latins, will penetrate far, until a second furious and%0a%3c trembling path has been beaten to the Great St. Bernard Pass. From there he will descend to%0a%3c mount the Pyrenees, which will not, however, be transferred to the French crown. And this third%0a%3c one will cause a great inundation of human blood, and for a long time Lent will not include%0a%3c March.%0a%3c %0a%3c The daughter will be given for the preservation of the Christian Church. Her lord will fall into%0a%3c the pagan sect of the new infidels. Of her two children, one will be faithful to the Catholic%0a%3c Church, the other an infidel.%0a%3c %0a%3c The unfaithful son, who, to his great confusion and later repentance, will want to ruin her, will%0a%3c have three widely scattered regions, namely, the Roman, Germany and Spain, which will set up%0a%3c diverse sects by armed force. The 50th to the 52th degree of latitude will be left behind.%0a%3c And all will render the homage of ancient religions to the region of Europe north of the 48th%0a%3c parallel. The latter will have trembled first in vain timidity but afterwards the regions to its west,%0a%3c south and east will tremble. But the nature of their power will be such that what has been brought%0a%3c about by concord and union will prove insuperable by warlike conquests.%0a%3c In nature they will be equal, but very different in faith.%0a%3c %0a%3c After this the barren Dame, of greater power than the second, will be received by two of the%0a%3c nations. First, by them made obstinate by the onetime masters of the universe. Second, by the%0a%3c latter themselves.%0a%3c %0a%3c The third people will extend their forces towards the circuit of the East of Europe where, in the%0a%3c Pannonias, they will be overwhelmed and slaughtered. By sea they will extend their Myrmidons%0a%3c and Germans to Adriatic Sicily. But they will succumb wholly and the Barbarian sect will be%0a%3c greatly afflicted and driven out by all the Latins.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then the great Empire of the Antichrist will begin where once was Attila's empire and the new%0a%3c Xerxes will descend with great and countless numbers, so that the coming of the Holy Ghost,%0a%3c proceeding from the 48th degree, will make a transmigration, chasing out the abomination of the%0a%3c Christian Church, and whose reign will be for a time and to the end of time.%0a%3c This will be preceded by a solar eclipse more dark and gloomy than any since the creation of the%0a%3c world, except that after the death and passion of Jesus Christ. And it will be in the month of%0a%3c October than the great translation will be made and it will be such that one will think the gravity%0a%3c of the earth has lost its natural movement and that it is to be plunged into the abyss of perpetual%0a%3c darkness.%0a%3c %0a%3c In the spring there will be omens, and thereafter extreme changes, reversals of realms and mighty%0a%3c earthquakes. These will be accompanied by the procreation of the new Babylon, miserable%0a%3c daughter enlarged by the abomination of the first holocaust. It will last for only seventy-three%0a%3c years and seven months.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then there will issue from the stock which had remained barren for so long, proceeding from the%0a%3c 50th degree, one who will renew the whole Christian Church. A great place will be established,%0a%3c with union and concord between some of the children of opposite ideas, who have been%0a%3c seperated by diverse realms. And such will be the peace that the instigator and promoter of%0a%3c military factions, born of the diversity of religions, will remain chained to the deepest pit. And%0a%3c the kingdom of the Furious One, who counterfeits the sage, will be united.%0a%3c The countries, towns, cities, realms and provinces which will have abandoned their old customs%0a%3c to gain liberty, but which will in fact have enthralled themselves even more, will secretly have%0a%3c wearied of their liberty. Faith lost in their perfect religion, they will begin to strike to the left,%0a%3c only to return to the right. Holiness, for a long time overcome, will be replaced in accordance%0a%3c with the earliest writings.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thereafter the great dog, the biggest of curs, will go forth and destroy all, the same old crimes%0a%3c being perpetrated again. Temples will be set up again as in ancient times, and the priest will be%0a%3c restored to his original position and he will begin his whoring and luxury, and will commit a%0a%3c thousand crimes.%0a%3c %0a%3c At the eve of another desolation, when she is atop her most high and sublime dignity, some%0a%3c potentates and warlords will confront her, and take away her two swords, and leave her only the%0a%3c insignia, whose curvature attracts them. The people will make him go to the right and will not%0a%3c wish to submit themselves to those of the opposite extreme with the hand in acute position, who%0a%3c touch the ground, and want to drive spurs into them.%0a%3c %0a%3c And hereupon it is that there is born of a branch long sterila one who will deliver the people of%0a%3c the world from this benevolent slavery to which they had voluntary submitted. He will put%0a%3c himself under the protection of Mars, stripping Jupiter of all his honors and dignities, and%0a%3c establish himself in the free city in another scant Mesopotamia. The chief and governor will be%0a%3c cast out from the middle and hung up, ignorant of the conspiracy of one of the%0a%3c conspirators with the second Thrasibulus, who for a long time will have directed all this.%0a%3c Then the impurities and abominations, with a great shame, will be brought out and manifested in%0a%3c the shadows of the veiled light, and will cease towards the end of the change in reign. The chiefs%0a%3c of the Church will be backward in the love of God, and several of them will apostatize from the%0a%3c true faith. Of the three sects, that which is in the middle, because of its own partisans, will be%0a%3c thrown a bit into decadence. The first one will be exterminated throughout all Europe and most%0a%3c of Africa by the third one, making use of the poor in spirit who, led by madmen to libidinous%0a%3c luxury, will adulterate.%0a%3c %0a%3c The supporting common people will rise up and chase out the adherents of the legislators. From%0a%3c the way realms will have been weakened by the Easterners, it will seem that God the Creator has%0a%3c loosed Satan from the prisons of hell to give birth to the great Dog and Doham, who will make%0a%3c such an abominable breach in the Churches that neither the reds nor the whites without eyes or%0a%3c hands will know what to make of it, and their power will be taken from them.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then will commence a persecution of the Churches the like of which was never seen.%0a%3c Meanwhile, such a plague will arise that more than two thirds of the world will be removed. One%0a%3c will be unable to ascertain the true owners of fields and houses, and weeds growing in the streets%0a%3c of cities will rise higher than the knees. For the clergy there will be but utter desolation. The%0a%3c warlords will usurp what is returned from the City of the Sun, from Malta and the Isles of%0a%3c Hyères. The great chain of the port which wakes its name from the marine ox will be opened.%0a%3c And a new incursion will be made by the maritime shores, wishing to deliver the Sierra More¤a%0a%3c from the first Mahometan recapture. Their assaults will not all be in vain, and the place which%0a%3c was once the abode of Abraham will be assaulted by persons who hold the Jovialists in%0a%3c veneration. And this city of "Achem" will be surrounded and assailed on all sides by a most%0a%3c powerful force of warriors. Their maritime forces will be weakened by the Westerners, and great%0a%3c desolation will fall upon this realm. Its greatest cities will be depopulated and those who enter%0a%3c will fall under the vengeance of the wrath of God.%0a%3c %0a%3c The sepulchre, for long an object of such great veneration, will remain in the open, exposed to%0a%3c the sight of the heavens, the Sun and the Moon. The holy place will be converted into a stable for%0a%3c a herd large and small, and used for profane purposes. Oh, what a calamitous affliction will%0a%3c pregnant women bear at this time.%0a%3c %0a%3c For hereupon the principal Eastern chief will be vanquished by the Northerners and Westerners,%0a%3c and most of his people, stirred up, will be put to death, overwhelmed or scattered. His children,%0a%3c offspring of many women, will be imprisoned. Then will be accomplished the prophecy of the%0a%3c Royal Prophet, Let him hear the groaning of the captives, that he might deliver the children of%0a%3c those doomed to die.%0a%3c %0a%3c What great oppression will then fall upon the Princes and Governors of Kingdoms, especially%0a%3c those which will be maritime and Eastern, whose tongues will be intermingled with all others:%0a%3c the tongue of the Latins, and of the Arabs, via the Phoenicians. And all these Eastern Kings will%0a%3c be chased, overthrown and exterminated, but not altogether, by means of the forces of the Kings%0a%3c of the North, and because of the drawing near of our age through the three secretly united in the%0a%3c search for death, treacherously laying traps for one another. This renewed Triumvirate will last%0a%3c for seven years, and the renown of this sect will extend arount the world. The sacrifice of the%0a%3c hole and immaculate Wafer will be sustained.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then the Lords of "Aquilon" [the North], two in number, will be victorious over the Easterners,%0a%3c and so great a noise and bellicose tumult will they make amongst them that all the East will%0a%3c tremble in terror of these brothers, yet not brothers, of "Aquilon" [the North].%0a%3c %0a%3c By this discourse, Sire, I present these predictions almost with confusion, especially as to when%0a%3c they will take place. Furthermore, the chronology of time which follows conforms very little, if%0a%3c at all, with that which has already been set forth. Yet it was determined by astronomy and other%0a%3c sources, including Holy Scriptures, and thus could not err. If I had wanted to date each quatrain,%0a%3c I could have done so. But this would not have been agreeable to all, least of all to those%0a%3c interpreting them, and was not to be done until Your Majesty granted me full power to do so, lest%0a%3c calumniators be furnished with an opportunity to injure me.%0a%3c %0a%3c Anyhow, I count the years from the creation of the world to the birth of Noah as 1,506, and from%0a%3c the birth of Noah to the completion of the Ark, at the time of the universal deluge, as 600 ( let the%0a%3c years be solar, or lunar, or a mixture of the ten ) I hold that the Sacred Scriptures use solar years.%0a%3c And at the end of these 600 years, Noah enetered the Ark to be saved from the deluge. This%0a%3c deluge was universal, and lasted one year and two months. And 295 years elapsed from the end%0a%3c of the flood to the birth of Abraham, and 100 from then till the birth of Isaac. And 60 years later%0a%3c Jacob was born. 130 years elapsed between the time he entered Egypt and the time he came out.%0a%3c Between the entry of Jacob into Egypt and the exodus, 430 years passed. From the exodus to the%0a%3c building of the Temple by Solomon in the fourth year of his reign, 480 yearss. According ot the%0a%3c calculations of the Sacred Writings, it was 490 years from the building of the Temple to the time%0a%3c of Jesus Christ. Thus, this calculation of mine, collected from the holy writ, comes to about%0a%3c 4,173 years and 8 months, more or less. Because there is such a diversity of sects, I will not go%0a%3c beyond Jesus Christ.%0a%3c %0a%3c I have calculated the present prophecies according to the order of the chain which contains its%0a%3c revolution, all by astronomical doctrine modified by my natural instinct. After a while, I found%0a%3c the time when Saturn turns to enter on April 7 till August 25, Jupiter on June 14 till October 7,%0a%3c Mars from April 17 to June 22, Venus from April 9 to May 22, Mercury from February 3 to%0a%3c February 24. After that, from June 1 to June 24, and from September 25 to October 16, Saturn in%0a%3c Capricorn, Jupiter in Aquarius, Mars in Scorpio, Venus in Pisces, Mercury for a month in%0a%3c Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, the Moon in Aquarius, the Dragon's head in Libra: its tail in%0a%3c opposition following a conjunction of Jupiter and Mercury with a quadrature of Mars and%0a%3c Mercury, and the Dragon's head coinciding with a conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter. And the%0a%3c year without an eclipse peaceful.%0a%3c %0a%3c But not everywhere. It will mark the commencement of what will long endure. For beginning%0a%3c with this year the Christian Church will be persecuted more fiercely than it ever was in Africa,%0a%3c and this will last up to the year 1792, which they will believe to mark a renewal of time.%0a%3c After this the Roman people will begin to re-establish themselves, chasing away some obscure%0a%3c shadows and recovering a bit of their ancient glory. But this will not be without great division%0a%3c and continual changes. Thereafter Venice will raise its wings very high in great force and power,%0a%3c not far short of the might of ancient Rome.%0a%3c %0a%3c At that time the great sails of Byzantium, allied with the Ligurians and through the support and%0a%3c power of "Aquilon" [the Northern Realm], will impede them so greatly that the two Cretans will%0a%3c be unable to maintain their faith. The arks built by the Warriors of ancient times will accompany%0a%3c them to the waves of Neptune. In the Adriatic great discord will arise, and that which will have%0a%3c been united will be seperated. To a house will be reduced that which was, and is, a great city,%0a%3c including "Pampotamia" and "Mesopotamia" of Europe at 45, and others of 41, 42 and 37%0a%3c degrees.%0a%3c %0a%3c It will be at this time and in these countries that the infernal power will set the power of its%0a%3c adversaries against the Church of Jesus Christ. This will constitute of the second Antichrist, who%0a%3c will persecute that Church and its true Vicar, by means of the power of three temporal kings who%0a%3c in their ignorance will be seduced by tongues which, in the hands of the madmen, will cut more%0a%3c than any sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c The said reign of the Antichrist will last only to the death of him who was born at the beginning%0a%3c of the age and of the other one of Lyon, associated with the elected one of the House of Modena%0a%3c and of Ferrara, maintained by the Adriatic Ligurians and the proximity of great Sicily. Then the%0a%3c Great St. Bernard will be passed.%0a%3c %0a%3c The Gallic Ogmios will be accompanied by so great a number that the Empire of his great law%0a%3c will extend very far. For some time thereafter the blood of the Innocent will be shed profusely by%0a%3c the recently elevated guilty ones. Then, because of great floods, the memory of things contained%0a%3c in these instruments will suffer incalculable loss, even letters. This will happen to the%0a%3c "Aquiloners" [the Northern People] by the will of God.%0a%3c %0a%3c Once again Satan will be bound, universal peace will be established among men, and the Church%0a%3c of Jesus Christ will be delivered from all tribulations, although the Philistines would like to mix%0a%3c in the honey of malice and their pestilent seduction. This will be near the seventh millenary,%0a%3c when the sanctuary of Jesus Christ will no longer be throdden down by the infidels who come%0a%3c from "Aquilon" [the North]. The world will be approaching a great conflagration, although,%0a%3c according to my calculations in my prophecies, the course of time runs much further.%0a%3c In the Epistle that some years ago I dedicated to my son, César Nostradamus, I declared some%0a%3c points openly enough, without presage. But here, Sire, are included several great and marvelous%0a%3c events which those to come after will see.%0a%3c %0a%3c During this astrological supputation, harmonized with the Holy Scriptures, the persecution of the%0a%3c Ecclesiastical folk will have its origin in the power of the Kings of "Aquilon" [the North], united%0a%3c with the Easterners. This persecution will last for eleven years, or somewhat less, for then the%0a%3c chief King of "Aquilon" will fall.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thereupon the same thing will occur in the South, where for the space of three years the Church%0a%3c people will be persecuted even more fiercely through the Apostatic seduction of one who will%0a%3c hold all the absolute power in the Church militant. The hole people of God, the observer of his%0a%3c law, will be persecuted fiercely and such will be their affliction that the blood of the true%0a%3c Ecclesiastics will flow everywhere.%0a%3c %0a%3c One of the horrible temporal Kings will be told by his adherents, as the ultimate in praise, that he%0a%3c has shed more of human blood of Innocent Ecclesiastics than anyone else could have spilled of%0a%3c wine. This King will commit incredible crimes against the Church. Human blood will flow in the%0a%3c public streets and temples, like water after an impetuous rain, coloring the nearby rivers red with%0a%3c blood. The ocean itself will be reddened by another naval battle, such that one king will say to%0a%3c another, Naval battles have caused the sea to blush.%0a%3c %0a%3c Then, in this same year, and in those following, there will ensue the most horrible pestilence,%0a%3c made more stupendous by the famine which will have preceded it. Such great tribulations will%0a%3c never have occurred since the first foundation of the Christian Church. It will cover all Latin%0a%3c regions, and will leave traces in some countries of the Spanish.%0a%3c %0a%3c Thereupon the third King of "Aquilon" [the North], hearing the lament of the people of his%0a%3c principal title, will raise a very mighty army and, defying the tradition of his predecessors, will%0a%3c put almost everything back in its proper place, and the great Vicar of the hood will be put back in%0a%3c his former state. But desolated, and then abandoned by all, he will turn to find the Holy of Holies%0a%3c destroyed by paganism, and the old and new Testaments thrown out and burned.%0a%3c %0a%3c After that Antichrist will be the infernal prince again, for the last time. All the Kingdoms of%0a%3c Christianity will tremble, even those of the infidels, for the space of twenty-five years. Wars and%0a%3c battles will be more grievous and towns, cities, castles and all other edifices will be burned,%0a%3c desolated and destroyed, with great effusion of vestal blood, violations of married woman and%0a%3c widows, and sucking children dashed and broken against the walls of towns. By means of Satan,%0a%3c Prince Infernal, so may evils will be commited that nearly all the world will find itself undone%0a%3c and desolated. Before these events, some rare birds will cry in the air: Hui, Hui [Today, today]%0a%3c and some time later will vanish.%0a%3c %0a%3c After this has endured for a long time, there will be almost renewed another reign of Saturn, and%0a%3c golden age. Hearing the affliction of his people, God the Creator will command that Satan be%0a%3c cast into the depths of the bottomless pit, and bound there. Then a universal peace will%0a%3c commence between God and man, and Satan will remain bound for around a thousand years, and%0a%3c then all unbound.%0a%3c %0a%3c All these figures represent the just integration of Holy Scriptures with visible celestial bodies,%0a%3c namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and others conjoined, as can be seen at more length in some of the%0a%3c quatrains. I would have calculated more profoundly and integrated them even further, Most%0a%3c Serene King, but for the fact that some given to censure would raise difficulties. Therefore I%0a%3c withdraw my pen and seek nocturnal repose.%0a%3c %0a%3c Many events, most powerful of all Kings, of the most astounding sort are to transpire soon, but I%0a%3c neither could nor would fit them all into this epistle; but in order to comprehend certain horrible%0a%3c facts, a few must be set forth. So great is your grandeur and humanity before men, and your piety%0a%3c before the gods, that you alone seem worthy of the great title of the Most Christian King, and to%0a%3c whom the highest authority in all religion should be deferred.%0a%3c %0a%3c But I shall only beseech you, Most Clement King, by this singular and prudent humanity of%0a%3c yours, to understand rather the desire of my heart, and the sovereign wish I have to obey Your%0a%3c Most Serene Majesty, ever since my eyes approached your solar splendour, than the grandeur of%0a%3c my labor can attain to or acquire.%0a%3c %0a%3c From Salon, this 27th of June, 1558.%0a%3c %0a%3c Done by Michel Nostradamus at Salon-de-Crau in Provence.%0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
