They  are  higher %0athan  a  Man  sitting  on  Horseback ;  and  they  are %0aalso  swifter  than  a  Horse  :  their  Wings  being %0aonly  given  them  to  help  them  in  running ;  for  otherwise %0athey  do  not  fly,  nor  do  they  even  rise  from  the  Ground. %0aThey  have  Hoofs  like  Deer,  and  with  them  they  fight ;  for %0aas  they  are  cloven,  they  serve  to  catch  up  Stones,  which %0awith  their  Legs  they  hurl  back  in  their  Flight  against  those %0athat  chase  them.  It  is  a  Wonder  in  their  Nature,  that %0awhatever  they  eat,  although  it  is  without  choice,  they  digest. %0aBut  their  Stupidity  is  not  less  remarkable ;  for,  high  as  the %0arest  of  their  Body  is,  if  they  hide  their  Head  and  Neck  in  a %0aBush,  they  think  themselves  altogether  concealed.

[BooK  X. %0a%0aAdvantages  obtained  from  them  are  their  Eggs,  which  are %0aso  big,  that  some  use  them  for  Vessels ;  and  their  Feathers %0aadorn  the  Crests  and  Helmets  of  Soldiers. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0aOf  the  Phoenix.1 %0a%0aTHE  Birds  of  Ethiopia  and  India  are  for  the  most  part %0aof  a  variety  of  Colours,  and  such  as  can  hardly  be  described : %0abut  the  Phoenix  of  Arabia  is  more  noble  than  all  others.  I %0a%0a1  The  Phoenix  is  one  of  the  most  renowned  of  the  fabulous  creatures %0aof  antiquity.  The  first  detailed  description  and  history  of  this  bird  that %0awe  meet  with  is  in  Herodotus  (Lib.  ii.  cap.  Ixxiii.),  whose  story  is  sub- %0astantially the  same  as  what  was  afterwards,  though  with  various  embel- %0alishments, repeated  and  believed  for  more  than  a  thousand  years. %0a%0aThe  passage  in  which  Tacitus  notices  the  Phoenix  is  very  remarkable, %0aand  deserves  to  be  quoted  at  length,  as  being  the  most  authentic  account %0aof  it  that  has  been  preserved,  and  also  as  showing  that  so  cautious  and %0aaccurate  a  man  as  he  is  always  considered  to  be,  entertained  no  kind  of %0adoubt  as  to  its  real  existence,  and  its  periodical  appearance  in  Egypt. %0a%0a"  A.U  c.  787,  A.B.  34.  Paulus  Fabius  and  Lucius  Vitellius  succeeded %0ato  the  consulship.  In  the  course  of  the  year  the  miraculous  bird,  known %0ato  the  world  by  the  name  of  the  Phoenix,  after  disappearing  for  a  series %0aof  ages,  revisited  Egypt.  A  phenomenon  so  very  extraordinary  could %0anot  fail  to  produce  abundance  of  speculation.  The  learning  of  Egypt  was %0adisplayed,  and  Greece  exhausted  her  ingenuity.  The  facts,  about  which %0athere  seems  to  be  a  concurrence  of  opinions,  with  other  circumstances,  in %0atheir  nature  doubtful  yet  worthy  of  notice,  will  not  be  unwelcome  to  the %0areader.  That  the  Phoenix  is  sacred  to  the  sun,  and  differs  from  the  rest %0aof  the  feathered  species  in  the  form  of  its  head,  and  the  tincture  of  its %0aplumage,  are  points  settled  by  the  naturalists.  Of  its  longevity  the %0aaccounts  are  various.  The  common  persuasion  is,  that  it  lives  five %0ahundred  years,  though  by  some  writers  the  date  is  extended  to  four- %0ateen hundred  and  sixty- one.  The  several  eras  when  the  Phoenix  has %0abeen  seen  are  fixed  by  tradition.  The  first,  we  are  told,  was  in  the  reign %0aof  Sesostris ;  the  second  in  that  of  Amasis ;  and  in  the  period  when %0aPtolemy,  the  third  of  the  Macedonian  race,  was  seated  on  the  throne  of %0aEgypt,  another  Phoenix  directed  his  flight  towards  Heliopolis,  attended %0aby  a  group  of  various  birds,  all  attracted  by  the  novelty,  and  gazing  with %0awonder  at  so  beautiful  an  appearance.  For  the  truth  of  this  account  we %0ado  not  presume  to  answer.  The  facts  lie  too  remote ;  and,  covered  as %0athey  are  with  the  mists  of  antiquity,  all  further  argument  is  suspended. %0a%0a%0aROOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  1 87 %0a%0acan  scarcely  tell  whether  it  be  false  or  no,  that  there  is  never %0amore  than  one  of  them  in  the  whole  World,  and  that  it  is %0avery  rarely  seen,  ft  is  said  to  be  of  the  size  of  an  Eagle : %0aas  bright  as  Gold  about  the  Neck;  the  rest  of  the  Body %0apurple  :  the  Tail  azure  blue,  with  Feathers  distinguished  by %0abeing  of  a  Rose-colour ;  and  the  Head  and  Face  adorned %0awith  a  Crest  of  Feathers  on  the  top.  Manilius,  the  noble %0aSenator,  excellently  well  versed  in  most  kinds  of  Learning, %0aby  his  own  unassisted  Efforts  was  the  first  and  most  diligent %0a%0aFrom  the  reign  of  Ptolemy  to  Tiberius,  the  intermediate  space  is  not %0aquite  two  hundred  and  fifty  years.  From  that  circumstance  it  has  been %0ainferred  by  many  that  the  last  Phoenix  was  neither  of  the  genuine  kind, %0anor  came  from  the  woods  of  Arabia.  The  instinctive  qualities  of  the %0aspecies  were  not  observed  to  direct  its  motions.  It  is  the  genius,  we  are %0atold,  of  the  true  Phoenix,  when  its  course  of  years  is  finished,  and  the %0aapproach  of  death  is  felt,  to  build  a  nest  in  its  native  clime,  and  there %0adeposit  the  principles  of  life,  from  which  a  new  progeny  arises.  The %0afirst  care  of  the  young  bird,  as  soon  as  fledged,  and  able  to  trust  to  its %0awings,  is  to  perform  the  obsequies  of  its  father.  But  this  duty  is  not %0aundertaken  rashly.  He  collects  a  great  quantity  of  myrrh,  and  to  try  his %0astrength,  makes  frequent  excursions  with  a  load  on  his  back.  When  he %0ahas  made  his  experiment  through  a  long  tract  of  air,  and  gains  sufficient %0aconfidence  in  his  own  vigour,  he  takes  up  the  body  of  his  father,  and  flies %0awith  it  to  the  altar  of  the  sun,  where  he  leaves  it  to  be  consumed  in  flames %0aof  fragrance.  Such  is  the  account  of  this  extraordinary  bird.  It  has,  no %0adoubt,  a  mixture  of  fable ;  but  that  the  Phoenix,  from  time  to  time, %0aappears  in  Egypt,  seems  to  be  a  fact  satisfactorily  ascertained." â€” MURPHY'S %0a"Tacitus"  Annals^  Book  vi.  sect.  28.  The  concluding  paragraph  of  this %0asecond  chapter  of  Pliny  is  the  best  comment  on  this  passage  of  Tacitus. %0a%0aThe  fable  of  the  Phoenix,  however,  is  not  only  found  in  heathen  au- %0athors, but  is  mentioned  and  believed  by  many  of  the  Jewish  Rabbinical %0awriters  also,  and  even  by  some  of  the  early  Fathers  of  the  Christian %0aChurch.  Nor  are  accounts  of  it  wanting  in  modern  authors,  even  down %0ato  so  late  a  period  as  the  middle  of  the  seventeenth  century ;  for  Sir %0aThomas  Brown,  in  the  12th  chap,  of  the  3d  book  of  his  "Vulgar %0aErrors,"  thinks  it  necessary  to  state,  at  some  length,  his  reasons  for  disbe- %0alieving the  existence  of  the  Phoenix.  Cuvier  is  of  opinion  that  the %0aoriginal  description  of  the  Phoenix  might  have  been  taken  from  the %0aPhasianus  pictus,  a  native  of  China;  which,  if  it  ever  once  flew  into %0aEgypt,  would  be  a  sufficient  foundation  for  the  portent.

[BooK  X. %0a%0aof  the  long  Robe  (Toga),  who  wrote  of  this  Bird ;  and  he %0areporteth,  that  no  Man  was  ever  known  to  see  him  feeding : %0athat  in  Arabia  he  is  sacred  to  the  Sun  :  that  he  liveth  660 %0aYears:  and  when  he  groweth  old,  he  builds  a  Nest  with  the %0aTwigs  of  Cassia  (Cinnamon)  and  Frankincense  Trees :  and %0awhen  he  hath  filled  it  with  Spices,  he  dieth  upon  it.  He %0asaith,  also,  that  out  of  his  Bones  and  Marrow  there  breedeth %0aat  first,  as  it  were,  a  little  Worm,  from  which  proceeds  a %0ayoung  Bird  ;  and  the  first  Thing  this  young  one  does,  is  to %0aperform  the  Funeral  Rites  of  the  former  Phoenix,  and  then %0ato  carry  away  the  whole  Nest  to  the  City  of  the  Sun,  near %0aPanchaea,  and  to  lay  it  down  upon  the  Altar.  The  same %0aManilius  affirmeth,  that  the  Revolution  of  the  great  Year %0aagreeth  with  the  Life  of  this  Bird ;  in  which  Year  the  same %0aSignification  of  the  Times  and  Stars  return  again  to  their %0afirst  Points  :  and  that  this  should  begin  at  Noon,  that  very %0aDay  when  the  Sun  entereth  the  Sign  Aries.  And  by  his %0asaying,  the  Year  of  that  Revolution  was  by  him  showed %0awhen  P.  Licinius  and  M .  Cornelius  were  Consuls.  Cornelius %0aValerianus  writeth,  that  while  Q.  Plautius  and  Sex.  Papinius %0awere  Consuls,  the  Phcenix  flew  into  Egypt.  He  was  con- %0aveyed to  the  City  (Rome)  in  the  Time  that  Claudius  the %0aPrince  was  Censor,  in  the  eight  hundredth  Year  of  the  City, %0aand  was  showed  openly  in  the  Assembly  of  the  People,  as %0aappeareth  in  the  Public  Records ;  but  no  Man  ever  made %0aany  doubt  that  this  was  a  counterfeit  Phoenix. %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aOf  Eagles.* %0a%0aOF  all  the  Birds  we  know,  the  Eagles  excel  both  in %0aHonour  and  Strength.  There  are  six  Kinds  of  them.  The %0a%0a1  In  his  account  of  the  Eagles,  when  Pliny  does  not  follow  Aristotle, %0ahe  may  have  been  chiefly  led  by  the  authority  of  the  books  of  the %0aAugurs;  to  whom  the  appearance  of  all  strange  birds  was  officially %0areported,  and  whose  office  led  them  to  study  minutely  their  habits.  The %0aabsence  of  description  in  their  writings  is  explained  by  the  fact,  that  their %0abooks  contained  coloured  figures  of  all  the  species  that  came  within  their %0a%0a%0aBOOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  1 89 %0a%0afirst  named  by  the  Greeks  Melanaetos,  which  is  the  same  as %0aValeria :  the  least  in  size,  but  the  strongest,  and  in  Colour %0ablack :  in  the  whole  Race  of  Eagles,  she  alone  feedeth  her %0ayoung :  for  the  rest  (as  we  shall  say  hereafter)  beat  them %0aaway :  she  only  crieth  not,  nor  keepeth  a-grumbling ;  and %0ashe  keepeth  commonly  on  the  Mountains.  Of  the  second %0aSort  is  Pygargus.  It  keepeth  about  Towns  and  Plains,  and %0ahath  a  whitish  Tail.  The  third  is  Morphnos,  which  Homer %0acalleth  also  Percnos.  Some  name  it  Plancns  and  Anataria:1 %0athe  second  in  Bigness  and  Strength,  loving  to  live  about %0aLakes.  Phcemonne,  who  was  said  to  be  the  Daughter  of %0aApollo,  hath  reported,  that  this  Eagle  has  Teeth ;  otherwise %0amute,  and  without  Tongue  :  also,  of  all  others  she  is  the %0ablackest,  and  hath  the  longest  Tail.  With  this  agrees %0aBotthius.  She  is  subtle ;  for  when  she  hath  seized  on  Tor- %0atoises, she  throweth  them  down  from  aloft  to  break  their %0aShells.  It  was  the  Fortune  of  the  Poet  ^Eschylus  to  die  by %0asuch  Means.

Of  all  the  Eagles  she  only  carrieth  away  the  dead  Prey  ; %0awhereas  when  the  others  have  killed  it,  they  settled  upon %0ait.  This  Kind  causeth  the  fifth  to  be  called  Gnesws,  as  being %0athe  true,  and  the  only  one  of  pure  descent.  This  Eagle  is  of %0aa  middle  size,  of  a  reddish  Colour,  and  rare  to  be  seen. %0aThere  remaineth  the  Haliaetos ;  which  hath  the  sharpest %0aSight  of  all  others,  poising  herself  on  high  ;  and  when  she %0aspieth  a  Fish  in  the  Sea,  down  she  comes  upon  it  with  a %0aRush,  and  dashes  the  Waves  aside  with  her  Breast  as  she %0asnatcheth  it  up.  That  Eagle  which  we  have  made  the  third, %0ahaunteth  standing  Waters  to  prey  upon  Water-fowl,  which %0anow  and  then  dive  under  the  Water  ;  but  she  seizeth  them %0aas  they  become  wearied  and  confounded.  The  Contest  is %0aworth  looking  at ;  while  the  Bird  endeavours  to  gain  the %0aShore  for  Refuge,  especially  if  it  be  well  covered  with  thick %0aReeds,  and  the  Eagle  for  her  Part  drives  her  from  thence %0awith  a  Blow  of  the  Wing  ;  and  whilst  the  Eagle  striketh, %0aand  in  so  doing  falleth  into  the  Lake,  the  Fowl  that  swim- %0ameth  beneath  the  Water,  seeing  the  Shadow  of  the  Eagle %0ahovering  about  the  Shore,  riseth  up  again  in  another  Place, %0awhere  her  Pursuer  could  least  have  looked  for  her.  This  is %0athe  Cause  why  these  Wild-fowl  commonly  swim  in  Flocks ; %0afor  when  they  are  many  together,  they  are  not  troubled, %0abecause  with  dashing  the  Water  with  their  Wings,  they %0adazzle  the  Sight  of  their  Enemy.  Often,  also,  the  very %0aEagles,  not  able  to  bear  up  the  Weight  they  have  seized,  are %0adrawn  under  the  Water  with  it.  The  Haliceetos  only,  before %0aher  young  ones  are  yet  feathered,  beats  them,  and  thereby %0aforces  them  to  look  full  against  the  Sunbeams;  and  if  she %0anotices  any  one  of  them  to  wink,  or  their  Eyes  to  water,  she %0athrows  it  out  of  the  Nest,  as  a  bastard  and  inferior  Sort ; %0abut  she  educates  that  one  whose  Eye-sight  is  strong  enough %0ato  sustain  the  Gaze.  Haliceeti  are  not  a  separate  Kind  of %0aEagles,  but  proceed  from  the  coupling  of  different  Sorts. %0aAnd  that  Kind  which  is  produced  by  them  is  regarded  as  a %0aSort  of  Ossifragus  ;  from  which  are  propagated  the  lesser %0a%0a%0aBooKX.]  History  of  Nature.  191 %0a%0aVultures ;  and  they  again  the  greater,  which  propagate %0anone  whatever.  Some  add  a  Kind  of  Eagle  which  they  call %0aBarbatae,  and  the  Tuscans  Ossifragae. %0a%0aBut  the  three  first  and  the  fifth  Kind  of  Eagles  have  in %0atheir  Nest  a  Stone  named  JEetites,1  which  some  call  Gagates ; %0aof  extensive  use  as  a  Medicine,  and  suffering  no  Injury  from %0aFire.  Now  this  Stone  is  also  pregnant ;  for  if  it  is  shaken, %0aanother  is  heard  to  rattle  within,  as  if  it  were  in  its  Womb. %0aBut  that  medical  Virtue  is  not  in  these  Stones  if  they  are  not %0ataken  away  out  of  the  very  Nest.  They  make  their  Nests  in %0aRocks  and  upon  Trees :  they  lay  three  Eggs,  but  two  only %0aare  hatched :  but  sometimes  they  have  been  seen  to  have %0athree  young  ones.  But  one  of  them  they  turn  out  of  the %0aNest,  because  they  will  not  be  troubled  with  feeding  it.  And %0atruly  Nature  hath  well  provided  that  at  such  a  Time  they %0ashall  not  be  able  to  provide  Meat ;  for  otherwise  they  were %0aenough  to  destroy'all  the  Young  of  the  wild  Beasts.  Also  at %0athis  Time  their  Talons  are  bent  inward;  and  through  Hunger %0atheir  Feathers  grow  white,  so  that  they  have  good  Cause  to %0ahate  their  Young.  But  when  they  have  cast  them  off,  the %0aOssifrages,  which  are  near  of  Kin  to  them,  receive  them  and %0abring  them  up  with  their  own  Birds.  But  the  parent  Eagles %0apersecute  them  still  when  they  are  full  grown,  and  drive %0athem  a  great  Way  off,  as  being  their  Rivals  in  the  Prey. %0aAnd  were  it  not  so,  one  pair  of  Eagles  needeth  a  large  Ex- %0atent of  Country  to  furnish  them  with  sufficient  Food.  They %0ahave,  therefore,  their  several  Coasts  for  Prey,  and  do  not %0atrespass  on  those  of  a  neighbouring  pair.  When  they  have %0aseized  a  Prey,  they  do  not  carry  it  away  presently,  but  first %0alay  it  down,  and  try  the  Weight  before  they  fly  off  with  it. %0aThey  do  not  die  for  Age  or  Sickness,  but  of  Famine,  by  rea- %0ason that  the  upper  Beak  of  their  Bill  so  far  overgrows  in- %0award, that  the  Crookedness  does  not  permit  them  to  open  it.2 %0a%0a1  B.  xxx.  ch.  xiv. ;  B.  xxxvi.  ch.  xxi. ;  B.  xxxvii.  ch.  xi. â€”  Wern.

The  Feathers  of  Eagles  laid  among  those  of %0aother  Fowls  will  consume  them.  It  is  said  that  the  Eagle %0aonly  is  never  smitten  with  Lightning ;  and  therefore  it  is %0ajudged  that  she  serveth  Jupiter  as  his  Armour-bearer. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0a%0aWhen  Eagles  began  to  be  the  Standards  of  the  Legions ;  and %0awhat  Fowls  they  are  that  have  War  with  Eagles. %0a%0aCAIUS  MARIUS, %0a%0ain  his  second %0a%0aConsulship, %0a%0aordained %0a%0athat   the %0a%0aRoman %0a%0aLegions  should  only  have  the  Eagle  for  their %0a%0aStandard.     For  before   that  Time  the   Eagle  marched %0a%0aforemost,  with  four  others  :  Wolves,  Minotaurs,  Horses %0a%0aand  Boars;  each  one  in  its  proper  Order.     Not  many %0a%0aYears  past  the  Eagle  alone  began  to  be  advanced  in  the %0a%0aBattle;  and  the  Rest  were  left  behind  in  the  Camp.     But %0a%0aMarius    rejected   them    altogether.      And    since    this    it   is %0a%0aobserved  that  scarcely  is  there  a  Camp  of  a  Legion  wintered %0a%0aat  any  Time,  without  having  a  pair  of  Eagles. %0a%0aOf  Eagles,  the  first  and  second  Kind  do  not  prey  only %0aupon  the  lesser  Quadrupeds,  but  also  maintain  Battle  with %0aDeer.  She  walloweth  in  the  Dust  and  gathereth  a  great %0adeal  of  it  among  her  Feathers,  and  then  settling  upon  the %0aHorns  she  shakes  it  off  into  his  Eyes,  flapping  it  about  his %0aFace  with  her  Wings,  until  she  drive  him  down  over  the %0aRocks.  Nor  is  one  Enemy  enough  for  the  Eagle  ;  but  her %0aFight  with  the  Dragon  is  more  sharp  and  much  more  dan- %0agerous, although  it  is  in  the  Air.  The  Dragon,  out  of  a %0agreedy  Desire  to  do  Mischief,  watcheth  to  destroy  the  Eggs %0aof  the  Eagle  ;  but  the  Eagle  again  for  this,  wherever  she %0a%0a%0aInsignia  Draconarius.

At  length  the  young  Girl  died  ; %0aand  when  her  Funeral-fire  was  set  a-burning,  the  Eagle %0athrew  itself  on  it,  and  was  consumed  to  Ashes  with  her.  For %0awhich  Cause  the  Inhabitants  erected  in  that  Place  a  Monu- %0ament, such  as  they  call  Herou'm,  denominated  (the  Tomb)  of %0aJupiter  and  the  Virgin,  because  that  Bird  is  consecrated  to %0athe  God. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VI. %0a%0aOf  Vultures. %0a%0aTHE  black  Vultures  are  the  best  of  that  kind  of  Birds. %0aNo  man  ever  could  meet  with  their  Nests;  and  therefore %0asome  have  thought  (but  untruly)  that  they  fly  to  us  out  of %0aan  opposite  World.  But  they  build  in  the  very  highest %0aRocks ;  and  their  young  ones  have  many  Times  been  seen, %0atwo  generally  together.  Umbricius,  who  was  the  most  skilful %0aAruspex  of  our  Age,  saith,  that  usually  they  lay  three  Eggs ; %0aof  which  they  take  one  of  them  to  purify  the  other  Eggs  and %0athe  Nest,  and  soon  after  they  cast  it  away :  also  that  they %0afly  two  or  three  days  before  to  the  place  where  there  will  be %0adead  Carcasses. %0a%0aCHAPTER  VII. %0aOf  the  Sangualis  and  Tmmussulus. %0a%0aTHE  Roman  Augurs  entertain  much  Doubt  concerning %0athe  Sangualis  and  the  Immussulus.

Also  the %0aTriorches,  so  called  from  the  Number  of  its  Testicles,  to %0awhich  Phemonoe  hath  given  the  principal  Place  in  Au- %0agury. The  Romans  called  it  Buteo ;  and  there  is  still  a %0aFamily  surnamed  from  it,  because  it  had  settled  upon  the %0aAdmiral's  Ship,  with  favourable  Auspices.  The  Greeks %0aname  that  Kind  YEsalo,  which  alone  is  seen  at  all  Times ; %0awhereas  the  rest  are  gone  when  Winter  cometh.  Hawks  are %0adivided  into  distinct  Kinds,  by  their  Greediness :  for  some %0anever  seize  a  Fowl  but  upon  the  Ground  :  others,  again, %0anever  attempt  a  Bird  except  it  is  flying  about  Trees :  and %0aothers  when  it  is  sitting  on  high :  and  some  when  they  fly  in %0athe  open  Air.  Therefore  the  Pigeons,  knowing  the  Danger %0aof  these  Things,  so  soon  as  they  espy  them,  either  alight %0aupon  the  Ground,  or  else  fly  low  ;  and  thus  help  themselves %0ain  a  contrary  Course  to  them.  There  is  in  the  Ocean  an %0a%0a1  Accipiter  is  a  general  name  for  Hawks ;  but  when,  as  at  Ch.  xvii.,  it %0ais  used  for  a  certain  species,  it  is  Fulco  nisus,  Sparrow  Hawk. %0a%0aTriorches:  JFalco  butco,  LINN.

On  the %0aother  Side  the  Hawkers  divide  the  Prey  with  the  Hawks : %0aand  by  Report  they  let  some  Birds  fly  again  aloft  into  the %0aAir,  for  the  Hawks  to  catch  for  themselves.  When  the  Time %0aof  Hawking  arrives,  they  will  by  their  Cry  and  Manner  of %0aFlying  together  invite  them  to  take  the  Opportunity.  It  is %0asaid  that  Lupi  (Bass)  do  the  like,  about  the  Lake  Mceotis : %0afor  unless  they  have  their  Part  with  the  Fishermen,  they %0atear  their  Nets  when  they  are  stretched  forth.  Hawks  do %0anot  eat  the  Heart  of  any  Bird.  The  Night-Hawk  is  called %0aCymindis  :  it  is  seldom  seen  in  the  Woods,  and  by  Daylight %0aseeth  little.  There  is  deadly  War  between  it  and  the  Eagle ; %0aand  often  they  are  both  taken,  by  holding  fast  one  with  the %0aother. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IX. %0a%0aOf  the  Coccyx,  which  usually  is  killed  by  Birds  of  its  own %0a%0aKind. %0a%0aTHE  Cuckoo2  appeareth  to  be  formed  of  an  Hawk, %0achanged  in  its  Shape  at  one  certain  Time  of  the  Year :  for %0athen  the  other  Hawks  are  not  to  be  seen,  unless  for  some %0avery  few  Days.

Hence  the  Greeks  denominated  the %0afalconry  hawks  Hierax,  and  the  falconer  Hieracaros;  although,  perhaps, %0athis  idea  of  their  sacred  character  may  have  been  derived  from  Egypt, %0awhere  the  Accipiter  JEgyptius  was  so  deemed,  because  it  preyed  on  serpents. %0a-  Wem.

Nay,  the  Hawk  will  devour  it  if  they  appear %0atogether ;  and  it  is  the  only  Bird  of  all  others  that  is  killed %0aby  those  of  its  own  kind.  It  altereth  its  Voice  also.  In  the %0aSpring  it  cometh  abroad,  and  at  the  rising  of  the  Dog-star  it %0ahideth  itself.  It  lays  always  in  other  Birds'  Nests,  and  most %0aof  all  in  the  Stock-doves',  commonly  one  Egg  only,  which %0ano  other  Bird  doth  besides ;  and  seldom  two.  The  Reason %0awhy  they  place  their  Young  under  other  Birds  is  because %0athey  know  that  all  Birds  hate  them,  for  even  little  Birds %0aannoy  them  ;  therefore,  that  the  whole  Race  of  them  should %0anot  be  utterly  destroyed,  they  make  no  Nest  of  their  own, %0abeing  otherwise  timorous  in  their  Nature.  The  Nurse,  there- %0afore, bringeth  up  the  substituted  Chick  in  the  adulterated %0aNest.  And  this  young  Cuckoo,  being  Greedy  by  Nature, %0aintercepteth  the  Meat  from  the  other  young  Birds,  and  so %0agroweth  fat ;  whereby  it  cometh  into  favour  with  the  Nurse. %0aShe  rejoiceth  in  its  Appearance,  and  wonders  at  herself  that %0ashe  hath  hatched  such  a  Chick.  The  rest,  which  are  her %0aown,  she  condemns  in  comparison  with  this  one,  as  being %0aStrangers,  and  suffereth  them  to  be  devoured  before  her %0aFace;  and  at  last  the  young  Cuckoo,  being  able  to  fly, %0aseizeth  also  her  Nurse.  And  by  that  Time  no  other  Bird %0ais  to  be  compared  to  the  young  Cuckoo  for  Sweetness  of %0aFlesh. %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0aOf  the  Milvus.1 %0a%0aTHE  Milvus  is  of  the  same  Kind  of  Hawks,  but  it  differs %0ain  size.

Those  which  have  hooked  Talons  for %0athe  most  part  feed  only  upon  Flesh. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XII. %0aOf  unlucky  Birds  :  the  Comix,  Corvus,  and  Bubo. %0a%0aTHE  Comix1  liveth  also  on  other  Food  :  for  when  they %0ameet  with  a  hard  Nut  which  resists  their  Bill,  they  will  fly %0aaloft  and  fling  it  against  the  Rocks  or  Tiles  many  Times %0atogether,  until  it  is  so  bruised  that  they  can  easily  break  it. %0aThis  Bird's  Chattering  is  inauspicious,  although  by  some  it %0ais  praised.  It  is  observed,  that  from  the  (going  down)  of  the %0aStar  Arcturus  to  the  coining  of  the  Swallow,  it  is  not  seen %0aelsewhere  but  in  the  Groves  and  Temples  of  Minerva,  and %0athat  but  seldom,  as  at  Athens.  Moreover,  this  Bird  only %0afeedeth  her  Young  for  a  good  while  after  they  are  able  to %0afly.  She  is  most  unlucky  at  the  Time  of  Young,  that  is, %0aafter  the  Solstice.  All  other  Birds  of  the  same  Race  drive %0atheir  young  ones  out  of  the  Nest,  and  force  them  to  fly;  as %0athe  Corvus  also,  which  likewise  feed  not  on  Flesh  only  ;  and %0athey  likewise,  when  they  perceive  their  young  ones  to  be %0a%0a1  Comix :  Corvus  corone,  the  Crow.

Therefore  about  little  Vil- %0alages there  are  commonly  not  above  two  Pair  of  them.  And %0aabout  Cranon  in  Thessaly,  there  is  not  above  one  Pair  of %0athem  :  for  the  Parents  yield  the  Place  to  the  Offspring. %0aThere  are  some  different  Properties  in  this  Bird,  and  that %0abefore-mentioned.  The  Corvi  breed  before  the  Solstice,  and %0afor  sixty  Days  they  are  sick,  chiefly  with  Thirst,  until  the  Figs %0aare  ripe  in  Autumn :  and  from  that  Time  the  Cornix  is  dis- %0aeased. The  Corvus  for  the  most  part  layeth  five  Eggs,  and %0athe  Vulgar  are  of  opinion  that  they  conceive  and  lay  Eggs  at %0athe  Bill ;  and  therefore  if  Women  with  Child  eat  a  Raven's %0aEgg,  they  shall  be  delivered  of  their  Children  at  the  Mouth: %0aand  generally  they  have  difficult  Labour  if  such  an  Egg  be %0abrought  into  the  House.  Aristotle  denieth  this :  no  more,  by %0aHercules,  than  the  Egyptian  Ibis  :  but  that  the  kissing  which %0awe  see  them  do  often,  is  like  what  Pigeons  also  do.  The %0aCorvi  alone  seem  to  have  a  Knowledge  of  their  own %0aSignifications  in  Presages;  for  when  the  Guests  of  Media %0awere  all  slain,  they  all  flew  away  out  of  Peloponnesus %0aand  the  Region  of  Attica.  The  worst  Signification  they %0aafford  is  when  they  swallow  their  Voice  as  if  they  were %0achoked. %0a%0aThe  Night-birds  have  also  crooked  Talons  ;  as  the  Noctua %0aBubo  and  Ulula.1  All  these  see  but  badly  in  the  Day-time. %0aThe  Bubo  betokeneth  Mourning,  and  is  most  execrable, %0aespecially  in  the  Presages  of  public  Affairs :  it  keepeth  in %0asolitary  Places ;  and  not  desolate  only,  but  also  such  as  are %0ahorrible,  and  hard  of  access.  It  is  the  Monster  of  the  Night, %0anot  uttering  a  clear  Sound,  but  muttering  a  Groan;  and %0atherefore,  if  seen  in  Cities,  or  otherwise  abroad  in  the  Light, %0ait  is  a  dreadful  Portent.  I  myself  know,  however,  that  it %0ahath  perched  upon  many  Houses  of  private  Men,  and  yet %0ano  deadly  Accident  followed.

He  reporteth %0a%0aaverting  the  omen.  The  science  was  divided  into  two  portions :  one  of %0awhich  referred  to  the  auspices,  or  the  view  of  birds ;  and  the  other,  which %0amore  especially  bore  the  name  of  augury  â€”  abavium  garritu  â€”  consisted %0ain  attending  to  the  sounds  uttered  by  birds.  The  birds  themselves  that %0aafforded  these  prognostications  were  supposed  to  be  moved  ab  anima %0asua,  by  an  inward  action  proceeding  from  the  influence  of  Deity :  those %0awhich  by  their  singing  attracted  the  attention  of  the  augurs,  were  termed %0aOscines  (Ch.  xxix.)  :  a  name  which  thus  became  a  denomination  for  all %0asinging-birds  :  such  as  were  supposed  to  signify  that  an  action  ought  not %0ato  be  persevered  in  were  called  Prohibltorice  (Ch.  xiv.),  and  the  word %0aobscene  was  simply  descriptive  of  birds  of  ill  omen,  although  the  term %0ahas  been  subsequently  applied  with  another  meaning.  A  journal  of  the %0atransactions  of  this  college  of  religious  naturalists  was  kept  of  the  occur- %0arence of  every  rare  event,  and  the  appearance  of  every  strange  bird, %0acoloured  representations  of  which  were  drawn,  for  reference  on  any  future %0aemergency.  For  the  conveniency  of  official  observation,  a  measured %0aspace,  termed  Pomarium,  round  the  walls  of  the  city,  and  separating  it %0afrom  the  country,  was  kept  free  from  buildings  or  enclosures ;  and  the %0aPalatine  hill  of  Rome  was  in  old  time  excluded  from  the  city  and  the %0aPornserium,  because  it  was  the  resort  of  birds  of  ill  omen.  Spaces  in  the %0asky  were  measured  out  by  the  official  staff;  and  the  birds  themselves %0awere  arranged  in  classes,  to  render  the  rules  of  prognostication  more  pre- %0acise. An  augur  who  entered  into  the  spirit  of  his  profession  was  neces- %0asarily skilful  in  ornithology ;  but  those  who  were  more  speculative  would %0amake  additions  to  species  or  classes,  whic'h  the  experience  of  others  would %0afail  to  confirm.  The  public  terror  was  thus  entirely  in  the  power  of  the %0aaugurs,  for  even  a  slight  change  of  structure,  discovered  when  the  bird %0awas  cut  asunder  for  sacrifice,  was  deemed  a  portent :  and  there  are  proofs %0athat  some  among  them  might  be  induced  to  shape  their  reports  in %0aa  manner  to  suit  private  purposes.  The  opinion  of  Accius  on  augurs  is %0athus  given : â€” %0a%0a"  Nihil  credo  auguribus,  qui  aures  verbis  divitant %0a%0aAlienas,  suas  ut  auro  locupletent  domos." %0aâ€”  Went.

The  Accipiter,  by  a %0apeculiar  Society  of  Nature,  renders  Assistance,  and  shareth %0athe  War.  Nigidius  writeth,  that  the  Noctua  for  sixty  Days %0ain  Winter  keepeth  close,  and  hath  nine  different  Notes. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVIII. %0aOf  the  Picus  Martins. %0a%0aTHERE  are  also  some  small  Birds  which  have  hooked %0aClaws,  as  the  Picus ;  which  is  distinguished  by  the  Name  of %0aMartius,  and  are  of  great  Account  in  Auspices.  They  that %0apeck  Holes  in  Trees,  and  climb  in  a  pilfering  Way  like %0aCats,  are  of  this  Race.  They  lie  supine,  and  when  they %0astrike  with  their  Bills  against  the  Bark,  they  know  by  the %0aSound  that  there  is  Food  within.  These  Birds  alone  bring %0aup  their  young  ones  in  Excavations  of  Trees.  And  if  a  Shep- %0aherd wedge  up  their  Holes,  the  Vulgar  believe  that  they  will %0aunstop  it  by  the  means  of  an  Herb  which  they  apply.

The  Prophet  answered,  that  if  the  Bird  were  let  go %0ait  would  portend  the  Ruin  of  the  Empire  ;  but  if  it  were %0akilled,  it  denounced  Death  to  the  Praetor ;  and  he  immediately %0atore  the  Bird  in  pieces :  nor  was  it  long  before  the  Prodigy %0awas  fulfilled.  There  are  also  some  of  this  Kind  that  feed %0aupon  Mast,  and  many  on  Apples;  but  they  do  not  live  on %0aFlesh  only,  except  the  Milvus,  which  causes  that  Bird  to  be %0amournful  in  Auguries. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIX. %0aOf  Birds  that  have  hooked  Talons  and  Fingers. %0a%0aTHOSE  which  have  crooked  Claws  do  not  assemble  in %0aFlocks,  but  prey  each  one  for  itself.

They %0aare  Rulers  of  their  own  Kind  ;  and  in  whatever  House  they %0aare,  they  exercise  Sovereignty.  This  is  gotten  by  fighting %0aone  with  another,  as  if  they  knew  that  naturally  they  had %0aWeapons  given  them  on  their  Legs  for  this  Purpose ;  and %0amany  Times  there  is  no  end  until  they  kill  one  another.  But %0aif  one  of  them  obtains  the  Palm,  immediately  he  croweth  for %0ahis  Victory,  and  makes  it  known  that  he  is  truly  the  Chief. %0aHe  that  is  beaten  hideth  himself  in  Silence  ;  but  beareth  his %0aBondage  with  Reluctance.  And  the  very  common  Sort,  also, %0aare  as  proud ;  marching  with  their  Neck  stretched  upright, %0aand  the  Comb  lifted  aloft.  And  there  is  not  a  Bird  besides %0athat  so  often  looketh  at  the  Sky,  at  the  same  Time  erecting %0ahis  arched  Tail ;  and  therefore  it  is,  that  they  are  a  terror  to %0aLions,  which  of  all  wild  Beasts  are  the  most  courageous. %0a%0aNow  of  these  Cocks,  some  are  bred  for  nothing  but  Wars %0aand  constant  Battles  ;  and  these  Cocks  have  rendered  illus- %0atrious the  Countries  from  whence  they  come,  as  Ilhodus  and %0aTenagra ;  in  a  second  Place  of  Honour  are  esteemed  those  of %0aMelos  and  Chalcis ;  so  that  to  those  Birds,  for  their  Worth, %0athe  Roman  Purple  affords  much  Honour.  These  are  they %0afrom  which- the  Tripudium  solistimum1  is  observed.  These  rule %0aour  Magistracy  every  Day ;  and  they  open  or  shut  their %0aHouses  to  them ;  they  urge  forward  or  hold  back  the %0aRoman  Rods ;  they  order  or  forbid  the  Battle,  and  were  the %0aAuspices  of  all  our  Victories  throughout  the  World  ;  and, %0a%0a1  A  kind  of  omen  derived  from  the  manner  of  their  eating.  It  was %0athe  business  of  the  proper  officers  to  watch  this :  of  others,  their  mode  of %0awalking ;  of  others,  their  voice  and  crowing;  of  others,  their  air  and  coun- %0atenance ;  and  the  principal  of  all  attended  to  the  appearance  of  their %0aentrails  in  sacrifice.  As  the  cock  was  peculiarly  an  emblem  of  watchful- %0aness, the  augury  derived  from  him  was  of  particular  importance  in  the %0aarmy;  and  cocks  continued  to  be  carried  with  armies  in  comparatively %0amodern  times,  professedly  to  proclaim  the  hours  by  their  crowing,  but %0acertainly  through  the  lingering  remains  of  ancient  custom.  â€”  Wer?i.

If  they  are  castrated %0athey  cease  to  crow.  And  this  Operation  is  practised  upon %0athem  in  two  Ways  :  either  by  burning  their  Loins  with  a  hot %0aIron,  or  by  cauterising  their  Thighs  beneath,  and  then  pre- %0asently applying  to  the  Ulcer  Potter's  Chalk  ;  and  thus  they %0awill  sooner  grow  fat.

When  they  have %0apassed  the  middle  they  fling  away  the  Stones  from  their %0aFeet;  and  when  they  are  come  to  the  Continent  they  dis- %0agorge the  Sand  from  their  Throat. %0a%0aCornelius  Nepos,  who  died  when  Divus  Augustus  was %0aSovereign,  where  he  wrote,  That  a  little  before  his  Time %0aMen  began  to  fatten  the  captured  Thrushes,  adds,  That %0aStorks  were  held  for  a  better  Dish  than  Cranes.  But  now, %0ano  Man  will  touch  (a  Stork) ;  while  the  Crane  is  sought  after %0aamong  the  principal  Delicacies.  From  whence  these  Storks %0ashould  come,  or  whither  they  return,  is  not  yet  known.  No %0adoubt  they  come  from  remote  Countries,  and  in  the  same %0amanner  as  the  Cranes ;  only  that  the  Cranes  are  our  Guests %0ain  Winter,  and  the  Storks  in  Summer.  When  they  are %0aabout  to  depart  they  assemble  in  a  Place  appointed,  and %0athey  form  such  a  Company  that  not  one  of  the  Kind  is  left, %0aunless  it  be  some  one  that  is  not  at  Liberty.  They  take  their %0aDeparture  on  the  given  Day,  as  if  by  an  established  Law. %0aAlthough  it  appeared  that  they  were  about  to  remove,  yet %0ano  Man  hath  seen  the  Flock  as  it  went ;  neither  do  we  see %0athem  come,  but  we  know  that  they  are  come,  and  they  do %0athe  one  and  the  other  always  by  Night.

There  is  a  Place  in  the %0aopen  Plains  of  Asia,  called  Pithonos-Come,  where  they %0aassemble,  and  make  a  murmuring  Noise  among  themselves, %0aand  tear  in  Pieces  that  one  which  was  the  last  to  arrive;  and %0athen  they  depart.

They  make  Way %0aforcibly  after  the  Manner  of  the  Beaks  of  Ships,  for  by  this %0aMeans  they  more  easily  divide  the  Air  than  if  they  drove  it %0abefore  them  with  a  straight  Front.  The  Flock  is  spread  out %0aby  Degrees,  expanding  itself  like  a  Wedge  behind,  and  so %0aaffords  a  great  Space  to  the  Wind,  which  impels  them.  They %0arest  their  Necks  upon  those  that  are  before  them,  and  as  the %0aLeaders  become  weary  they  retire  behind.  Storks  seek  the %0asame  Nest,  and  they  support  their  aged  Parents  in  return  for %0atheir  Kindness. %0a%0aSome  say  there  is  lamentable  singing  at  the  Death  of %0aSwans,  but  untruly,  as  I  suppose  ;  for,  from  some  Experience, %0athese  Birds  devour  one  another's  Flesh  among  themselves. %0a%0aBut  this  Discourse  of  those  Fowls  that  make  Voyages  in %0aFlocks  over  Seas  and  Lands  will  not  allow  me  to  put  off %0aspeaking  of  lesser  Birds  also,  which  are  of  the  same  Nature; %0afor  those  before-named  may  seem  to  be  induced  to  do  so  by %0athe  size  and  strength  of  their  Bodies.  Quails,1  therefore, %0aalways  come  before  the  Cranes.  It  is  a  little  Bird,  and  when %0ait  comes  to  us,  it  belongs  to  the  Ground  rather  than  the  Air. %0aThe  Manner  of  their  flying  is  like  the  former ;  not  without %0asome  Danger  of  the  Sailors  when  they  approach  near  to %0aLand.  Because  they  often  settle  upon  their  Sails,  which  they %0ado  always  in  the  Night,  and  sink  Vessels.  Their  Journey  is %0athrough  established  Resting-places.  In  the  Southwind  they %0ado  not  fly;  because  it  is  wet  and  heavy.  And  yet  they %0achoose  to  be  conveyed  by  the  Wind,  on  Account  of  the %0aWeight  of  their  Bodies  arid  their  feeble  Strength.  Hence  as %0athey  fly  their  complaining  expresses  their  Effort.  Com- %0amonly, therefore,  they  fly  with  a  North  Wind,  the  Ortygo- %0ametra  being  the  Leader.

Whenever  they  are  upon %0atheir  Departure  hence  they  solicit  other  Birds  to  accompany %0athem,  and  by  their  Inducements  there  go  with  them  the %0aGlottis,1  Otis,2  and  Cychramus.3  The  Glottis  putteth  forth  a %0along  Tongue ;  from  which  it  hath  its  Name.  This  Bird  is %0avery  forward  at  the  first  setting  out  on  the  pleasant  Journey; %0abut  it  findeth  Repentance  in  the  Pain  of  the  Flight.  To  go %0aback  again  without  Company  it  is  ashamed ;  and  so  to  lag %0abehind  ;  neither  does  it  ever  persevere  for  more  than  one %0aDay;  for  at  the  next  Resting-place  it  deserteth  the  Com- %0apany ;  but  it  meeteth  with  others  which  the  Year  before  were %0aleft  behind  :  and  thus  they  do  from  Time  to  Time.  The %0aCychramus  is  of  a  more  persevering  Nature,  and  maketh %0aHaste  to  reach  those  Parts  which  it  so  much  desireth :  and %0atherefore  in  the  Night  it  rouses  them,  and  puts  them  in %0amind  of  the  Journey.  The  Otis  is  less  than  the  Bubo,  and %0alarger  than  the  Noctua,  having  two  Ears,  formed  of  Fea- %0athers standing  aloft ;  from  which  it  took  its  Name.  But  in %0aLatin  some  have  called  it  Asio.  This  Bird,  besides,  is  skilful %0ain  Imitation,  like  a  Parasite;  and,  in  a  particular  Way,  a %0aDancer.  It  is  easily  taken  as  the  Noctua,  while  it  looks %0aintently  on  any  one,  by  another  that  goes  round  it.  But  if  a %0acontrary  Wind  should  begin  to  hinder  the  Flight  of  the %0aTroop,  they  render  their  Progress  steady  by  grasping  small %0aweighty  Stones,  or  stuffing  their  Throat  with  Sand.  The %0aSeed  of  the  Veratrum  is  a  grateful  Food  to  Quails;  for %0awhich  Reason  they  are  banished  from  Table.

Then  the  Tone  is %0agiven  out,  modulated  according  to  the  one  perfect  Science  of %0aMusic;  for  a  while  in  one  entire  Breath  she  draweth  out  her %0aTune  at  length;  now  it  is  varied  in  Inflections;  sometimes  it %0ais  distinguished  by  Stops ;  it  is  united  by  entwining,  it  is %0aextended  in  being  drawn  back ;  on  a  sudden  it  is  drowned  : %0anow  and  then  she  records  to  herself  full,  grave,  sharp,  short, %0adrawn  out  where  she  sees  fit;  vibrating,  high,  middle,  low. %0aIn  short,  there  is  not  any  manufacture  of  a  Pipe  so  exqui- %0asitely contrived  by  the  Art  of  Man  that  can  accomplish  such %0aa  Variety  of  Things  as  proceed  out  of  that  little  Throat  of %0ahers.

They  strive  who %0acan  do  best ;  and  it  is  evident  that  they  contend  with  all %0atheir  Heart ;  for  often  she  that  is  conquered  ends  her  Life  in %0athe  Contest,  and  yieldeth  up  her  Breath  sooner  than  her %0aSong.

But  it  was  very  different  from  what  has  been %0asince  known  when  this  bird  builds  a  nest ;  for  it  will  not  always  under- %0atake the  labour,  but  sometimes  contents  itself  with  leaving  the  eggs  on %0athe  bare  earth,  at  the  end  of  a  hole  in  the  ground.

Another,  called %0aArgatilis,2  makes  her  Nest  of  the  same  form,  but  it  is  woven %0aof  Flax. %0a%0aA  kind  of  Picus3  maketh  a  Nest  in  the  manner  of  a  Gob- %0alet, and  hangeth  it  at  a  Twig,  on  the  uppermost  Branches, %0athat  no  Quadruped  may  be  able  to  reach  it.  It  is  established %0athat  Galguli  (Orioles)  take  their  Sleep  hanging  by  their %0aLegs,  hoping  by  that  means  to  be  in  more  Safety.  It  is,  in- %0adeed, commonly  known,  that  all  these  Birds,  with  good %0aProvidence,  choose  some  cross  Boughs  for  Rafters,  to  sup- %0aport their  Nests ;  and  then  cover  them  from  the  Rain  with %0aan  arched  Roof,  or  else  enclose  them  among  the  thick %0aLeaves. %0a%0aIn  Arabia  there  is  a  Bird  called  Cinnamologos,4  which %0abuilds  her  Nest  with  Twigs  of  the  Cinnamon-tree.  The %0aInhabitants  of  that  Country  shake  them  down  with  Arrows %0aheaded  with  Lead,  for  the  sake  of  Profit.  In  Scythia,  there %0ais  a  Bird  of  the  bigness  of  an  Otis,  which  layeth  two  Eggs; %0aand  she  always  wraps  them  in  a  Hare's  Skin  ;  and  hangeth %0athem  upon  the  top  Branches  of  Trees.

One  is  called  Merops,1  that  useth  to %0afeed  her  Parents  as  they  lie  hid.  The  inside  of  her  Feathers %0ain  the  Wing  is  pale,  the  outside  blue ;  and  those  above  about %0athe  Neck,  reddish.  She  maketh  her  Nest  in  a  Hole  six  Feet %0adeep  within  the  Ground.  Partridges  so  fortify  their  Place  of %0adeposit  with  Thorns  and  Twigs,  that  they  are  sufficiently %0afenced  against  wild  Beasts.  They  heap  up  over  their  Eggs  a %0acovering  of  fine  Dust;  neither  do  they  sit  in  the  Place  where %0athey  laid  them  first,  but  lest  their  more  frequent  resort  to  it %0ashould  lead  to  Suspicion,  they  convey  them  to  some  other %0aPlace.  And,  indeed,  the  Hens  deceive  also  the  Males ;  for  so %0alecherous  are  they,  that  they  break  their  Eggs,  because  they %0amay  not  be  occupied  about  sitting.  Then  through  desire %0aafter  the  Hens,  the  Males  fight  among  themselves ;  and  they %0asay  that  the  one  which  is  overcome,  suffereth  Venus.  Trogus %0areporteth  the  same  of  Quails,  and  sometimes  of  Dunghill %0aCocks.  He  saith,  also,  that  tame  Partridges  use  to  tread %0athe  wild ;  and  those  which  are  new  taken  or  conquered  by %0aothers  promiscuously.  This  libidinous  Heat  maketh  them %0aso  quarrelsome,  that  oftentimes  it  leads  to  their  being  taken. %0aFor  when  the  Fowler  cometh  with  his  Call,  out  goeth  the %0aLeader  of  the  whole  Flock  to  fight  him ;  and  when  he  is %0acaught,  another  followeth  after,  and  so  the  rest  one  after %0aanother.

If  the  Hens  stand  over-against  the %0aCocks,  the  Air  that  passeth  from  them  causes  them  to  con- %0aceive. For  so  hot  are  they  in  that  Season,  that  they  gape %0aand  hang  out  the  Tongue.  And  if  the  Males  fly  over  them, %0awith  the  Breath  that  cometh  from  them  they  conceive :  and %0amany  Times  if  they  do  but  hear  their  call.  And  so  effec- %0atually does  their  Lechery  overcome  their  Affection  to  their %0aYoung,  that  while  they  are  incubating  in  some  secret  Place, %0aif  they  hear  the  Fowler's  (Decoy)  Female  coming  towards %0athe  Male,  she  returns  the  Song,  and  calls  back  the  Males, %0aand  offers  herself  to  his  Pleasure.  Indeed  they  are  borne %0aaway  with  such  Rage,  that,  as  if  blind  with  the  Trepidation, %0athey  will  settle  upon  the  Head  of  the  Fowler.  If  he  begins %0ato  approach  the  Nest  of  the  breeding  Hen,  she  will  run  forth %0ato  his  Feet,  counterfeiting  that  she  is  very  heavy  and  feeble; %0aand  either  in  her  running,  or  some  short  flight,  she  will  sud- %0adenly fall,  as  if  she  had  broken  a  Wing  or  her  Leg :  then %0awill  she  run  again,  and  when  he  is  just  ready  to  take  her  up, %0ayet  will  she  shift  away,  and  so  disappoint  his  Hope,  until  she %0ahath  led  him  a  contrary  Way  from  the  Young.  When  she  is %0afree  from  Fear,  and  void  of  motherly  Care,  then  will  she  get %0ainto  a  Furrow  of  the  Ground,  lie  on  her  Back,  catch  a  Clot %0aof  Earth  with  her  Feet,  and  with  it  hide  herself.

The  Females  endure  their  imperious  Males,  and %0aeven  those  which  are  churlish ;  because  they  are  jealous, %0athough  their  Nature  is  not  that  Way.  Then  the  Throat  is %0afull  of  Complaint,  and  they  peck  them  cruelly  with  their %0aBeaks;  and  yet  soon  after,  by  way  of  Satisfaction,  they  kiss %0athem,  and  will  make  court  to  them,  by  turning  round  about %0amany  Times  with  their  Feet,  and  utter  the  Prayers  of  Venus. %0aThe  Male  and  the  Female  love  their  Young  alike :  and %0aoften  there  is  Correction,  because  the  Hen  does  not  more %0afrequently  visit  her  Young.  When  they  are  about  to  lay, %0athey  comfort  and  minister  to  them.

The  Hens  live  somewhat  longer. %0aBut  to  come  again  to  Doves,  it  is  true  that  they  have  a  cer- %0atain Understanding  of  Glory ;  and  you  would  think  that %0athey  have  a  Knowledge  of  their  Colours,  and  their  change- %0aable Disposition.  Moreover,  they  seem  to  take  a  Pride  in %0aflying  in  the  Air,  and  cutting  the  Air  every  way.  In  which %0aDisplay,  while  they  flap  with  their  Wings  with  much  Noise %0a(which  cannot  be  without  the  dashing  of  the  Feathers %0aof  their  Wings  against  their  Shoulders),  they  are  exposed  to %0athe  Hawks  as  if  they  were  bound ;  for  otherwise,  if  the %0aFlight  were  free,  they  were  much  more  swift  of  Wing.

Many  Men  are  gone  mad  in  their  Love  to  these  Birds: %0athey  build  Towers  above  the  tops  of  their  Houses  for  them ; %0aand  they  reckon  up  their  Origin  and  Nobility,  as  in  one  old %0aExample.  L.  Axius,  a  Roman  Knight,  before  the  Civil  War %0awith  Pompey,  sold  every  pair  (of  Pigeons)  for  four  hundred %0aDenarii,1  as  M.  Varro*  reports.  Besides  this,  they  have %0arendered  their  Country  noble ;  for  Campania  is  supposed %0ato  produce  by  far  the  greatest.

They  were  fattened  for %0athe  market  under  the  parent ;  their  food  being  made  easy  of  access,  while %0aa  few  quill-feathers  were  drawn  from  the  wing,  and  the  thighs  broken. %0aIt  was  found  that  fastening  the  legs  made  them  more  uneasy,  and  thus %0aproved  a  greater  hindrance  to  their  fattening  than  the  fracture.

They  turn  about,  also,  to  be  purified,  and %0awith  some  Sprigs  of  a  Bush  they  purify  by  Lustration  them- %0aselves and  their  Eggs. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLII. %0aOf  Carduelis,3  Psittacus,  of  Birds  that  speak. %0a%0aTHE  Carduelis  is  the  smallest  of  Birds ;  and  they  execute %0aCommands,  not  only  with  their  Voice,  but  also  with  their %0aFeet  and  Mouth,  as  if  they  were  Hands.  In  the  Territory  of %0aArelate,  there  is  a  Bird  called  Taurus,4  because  it  loweth  like %0aa  Bull,  although  otherwise  a  small  Bird.  There  is  another %0aalso  named  Anthus,5  which  imitates  the  neighing  of  Horses ; %0aand  if  by  the  Approach  of  Horses  it  is  driven  from  their %0aGrass  on  which  it  feeds,  it  will  neigh,  and  so  be  revenged  of %0athem.

It  is  green  all %0aover  the  Body,  only  it  hath  a  distinct  Collar  about  the  Neck %0aof  vermilion  red.  The  Parrot  salutes  Emperors,  and  pro- %0anounces what  Words  she  heareth ;  she  is  also  very  wanton %0aunder  the  Influence  of  Wine.  Her  Head  is  as  hard  as  her %0aBeak.  When  she  learns  to  speak,  she  must  be  beaten  about %0athe  Head  with  a  Rod  of  Iron  :  for  otherwise  she  careth  for %0ano  Blows.  When  she  taketh  her  Flight  downward,  she %0aalighteth  upon  her  Bill,  and  leans  upon  it,  and  by  that %0ameans  favoureth  her  Feet,  which  are  but  feeble. %0a%0aThere  is  a  kind  of  Pica  (Magpie)  of  less  excellency,  be- %0acause she  does  not  come  from  so  far ;  but  she  pronounceth %0awhat  is  taught  her  more  freely  and  distinctly.  These  take  a %0aLove  to  the  Words  they  speak ;  for  they  not  only  learn %0athem,  but  they  delight  in  them :  insomuch  that  they  study %0athem  inwardly,  and  by  their  careful  thinking  upon  what %0athey  learn,  they  show  how  attentive  they  are.  It  is  known %0athat  they  have  died  for  Grief  that  they  could  not  conquer %0athe  Difficulty  of  some  Words ;  as  also,  that  unless  they  hear %0athe  same  Words  repeated  often,  their  Memory  fails  to  retain %0athem.  If  they  are  in  search  of  a  Word,  and  chance  te  hear %0ait  pronounced,  they  will  show  wonderful  Signs  of  Joy.  Their %0aBeauty  is  not  ordinary,  although  not  very  lovely.  But  they %0aare  handsome  enough  in  the  Power  to  imitate  human  Speech. %0aIt  is  said,  that  none  of  their  kind  are  able  to  learn,  except %0asuch  only  as  feed  upon  Mast;  and  among  them,  those  acquire %0athe  more  easily  that  have  five  toes  to  their  Feet:  but  not %0aeven  these  unless  in  the  two  first  Years  of  their  Age.  Their %0aTongue  is  broader  than  ordinary :  as  they  are  all  in  every %0aseparate  kind  that  counterfeit  Man's  Voice :  although  this %0ahappens  to  almost  all  Birds.  Agrippina,  the  Wife  of  Clau- %0adius Caesar ,  had  a  Turdus  (Thrush)  at  the  Time  I  compiled %0athis  Book,  which  imitated  Man's  Speech ;  a  Thing  never %0aknown  before.  The  young  Ccesars,  also,  had  a  Sturnus %0a(Starling)  and  Nightingales  taught  to  speak  Greek  and %0a%0a1  Psittacus  Alexandra  LINN.     Parrot.  â€”  Wern.

Moreover,  they  would  study  their  Lessons  all  Day, %0aand  continually  come  out  with  new  Words  formed  into  a  long %0aSpeech.  To  teach  them,  these  Birds  must  be  in  a  Place %0aapart,  where  they  can  hear  no  other  Voice  to  mingle  with %0awhat  they  learn ;  and  one  is  to  sit  by  them,  who  must  repeat %0aoften  what  he  would  have  them  fix  in  their  Memory,  and %0aplease  them  also  with  giving  them  Meat. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLIII. %0aThe  Understanding  of  Ravens  (Conn). %0a%0aLET  us  not  defraud  the  Ravens  also  of  their  due  Praise, %0aas  witnessed  not  only  by  the  Knowledge  but  the  Indignation %0aof  the  People  of  Rome.  When  Tiberius  was  Prince,  there %0awas  a  young  Raven  hatched  in  a  Nest  upon  the  Temple  of %0aCastor  (and  Pollux),  which  took  his  Flight  into  a  Shoe- %0amaker's Shop  overagaiiist  the  Temple,  and  thus  was  com- %0amended to  the  Master  of  the  Shop  by  the  Obligation  of %0aReligion.  This  Raven  in  Time  became  accustomed  to  Man's %0aSpeech,  and  every  Morning  would  fly  to  the  Rostra,  and %0aturning  to  the  Forum,  he  would  salute  Tiberius,  and  after %0ahim  Germanicus  and  Drusus,  the  Ccesars,  by  their  Names ; %0aand  presently  the  People  of  Rome  that  passed  by.  And %0awhen  he  had  so  done,  he  would  fly  again  to  the  Warehouse. %0aThis  Practice  he  continued  for  several  Years  together,  to  the %0aWonder  of  all.  The  Master  of  the  nearest  Shoemaker's %0aShop,  either  through  Envy  of  his  Neighbour,  or  some  sudden %0afit  of  Anger  (as  he  wished  it  to  appear)  because  the  Raven %0ahad  made  a  Spot  upon  a  Pair  of  his  Shoes  with  his  Dung, %0akilled  the  Bird  ;  at  which  the  People  took  such  Indignation, %0athat  they  first  drove  him  out  of  that  Neighbourhood,  and %0anot  long  after  murdered  him  ;  and  the  Funeral  of  the  Raven %0awas  solemnly  performed  with  all  the  ceremonial  Obsequies. %0aFor  the  Bier  was  formed  and  bedecked,  and  so  carried  upon %0athe  Shoulders  of  two  Ethiopians,  with  a  Piper  going  before, %0awith  Crowns  of  all  kinds,  as  far  as  to  the  funeral  Fire ; %0awhich  was  piled  at  the  right  Hand  of  the  Appian  Way,  at %0athe  secoHd  Stone,  in  a  Field  called  Rediculi,  Thus  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  233 %0a%0aPeople  of  Rome  regarded  the  ready  Wit  of  this  Bird  a  suffi- %0acient Cause  to  justify  a  sumptuous  Funeral,  and  also  to %0aexcuse  the  Murder  of  a  Citizen  of  Rome  in  that  City, %0awherein  many  Princes  have  died,  and  no  IV3an  solemnized %0atheir  Funerals :  one  Instance  of  which  is,  that  no  one %0aavenged  the  Death  of  Scipio  JEmiUanus,  after  he  had  de- %0astroyed both  Carthage  and  Numantia.  This  happened  the %0afifth  Day  before  the  Calends  of  April,  in  the  Year  when %0aM.  Svrvilius  and  C.  Cestius  were  Consuls.  Even  at  this %0aTime,  when  I  am  writing,  there  is  in  the  City  of  Rome  a %0aCrow  (Comix)  belonging  to  a  Roman  Knight,  who  brought %0ait  from  Bsetica,  which  was  an  admirable  Bird  for  the %0aexceeding  black  Colour  of  its  Feathers,  and  also  for  pro- %0anouncing many  Words  formed  into  a  Sentence  ;  and  it  learns %0amore  and  more  every  Day.  It  is  not  long  since  that  there %0aarose  a  Report  of  a  Man  in  Erizena,  a  Country  of  Asia, %0awhose  Name  was  Craterus  Motioceros :  who  used  to  hunt  by %0athe  Help  of  Ravens,  which  he  carried  with  him  into  the %0aWoods,  perching  upon  his  Shoulders  and  his  Hunting- %0ahorns  :  and  these  would  seek  out  and  put  up  others,  and %0abring  them  to  him  in  their  Company  ;  so  that  when  he %0areturned  homeward  out  of  the  Forest,  the  wild  ones  'also %0awould  accompany  him.  Some  have  thought  it  worth  the %0asetting  upon  Record,  that  a  Raven  was  seen,  when  she  was %0athirsty,  to  cast  Stones  into  the  Bucket  belonging  to  a %0aSepulchre,  in  which  there  was  some  Rain-water  remaining,* %0abut  which  he  was  not  able  to  reach:  and  being  afraid  to  go %0adown  into  it,  he  thrust  in  so  many  Stories  that  he  was  enabled %0ato  drink  as  much  as  he  pleased. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLIV. %0aOf  the  Birds  of  Diomedes. %0a%0aNEITHER  will  I  pass  over  the  Birds  (called)  Diomedeae,1 %0awhich  Juba    nameth    Cataractae ;    and    he   says   they    have %0a%0a1  This  appears  to  be  Lestris  cataractes,  Cuv. ;  Skua,  or  a  kindred %0aspecies.  ^Elian  speaks  of  it  as  a  kind  of  Heron :  B.  i.  ch.  i.  â€”  Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a%0a234  History  of  Nature.

They  have  always  two  Leaders,  one  to  lead  the  Host, %0aand  the  other  to  guard  the  rear.  With  their  Bills  they  dig %0aFurrows,  over  which  they  strew  Bundles  of  Sticks,  and  cover %0athem  with  the  Earth  that  they  have  before  thrown  out ;  and %0ain  these  Recesses  they  breed.  Every  one  of  these  Trenches %0ahath  two  Doors :  one  looking  toward  the  East,  through %0awhich  they  go  out  to  feed  ;  and  the  other  looking  west- %0award, by  which  they  return.  When  these  Birds  discharge %0athemselves,  they  always  fly  against  the  Wind.  They  are %0afound  only  in  one  Place  of  all  the  World,  which  is  an %0aIsland,  ennobled,  as  we  have  written  before,  for  the  Tomb %0aand  Shrine  of  Diomedes,  opposite  the  Coast  of  Apulia.  These %0aBirds  are  like  the  Fulicae.  They  annoy  Strangers  that  come %0athither  with  their  Cries  ;  but  they  fawn  upon  Greeks  only,  as %0aif  they  give  such  friendly  Welcome  to  the  Race  of  Diomedes. %0aEvery  Day  they  fill  their  Throat  and  Wings  with  Water,  arid %0aso  wash  and  purify  the  Temple;  and  hence  arose  the  Fable, %0athat  the  Companions  of  Diomedes  were  turned  into  the %0aShapes  of  these  Birds. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLV. %0aWhat  Animals  cannot  learn  anything. %0a%0aAND  now  that  we  are  in  this  Discourse  on  Ingenuity,  I %0amust  not  omit  to  note,  that  among  Birds,  the  Swallows %0a(Hirundines),  and  of  land  Animals  the  Mouse  (Mures), %0aare  very  untoward  in  being  brought  to  learn.  Whereas %0aElephants  do  what  they  are  commanded.  Lions  draw  under %0athe  Yoke :  Seals  (Vituli)  in  the  Sea,  and  very  many  sorts %0aof  Fishes  grow  to  be  tame. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVI. %0aThe  manner  of  Birds  in  their  drinking. %0a%0aBIRDS  drink  by  sucking ;  and  those  which  have  long- %0aNecks  make  Pauses  between,  with  the  Head  thrown  back- %0award, as  if  they  would  pour  the  Water  into  themselves.

And  this  Bird  hath  the  Property  hy  himself  to  dip %0aall  his  Meat  at  Times  in  Water,  and  then  with  his  Foot  in %0athe  Place  of  a  Hand,  to  reach  it  to  his  Bill.  The  best  of  his %0akind  are  in  Comagene.  Their  Bills  and  very  long  Thighs %0aare  red. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVII. %0a%0aOf  the  Himantopos^  the   Onocrotalis,  and  other %0aforeign  Birds. %0a%0aLIKE  in  that  respect  to  the  Porphyrio,  is  the  Himan- %0atopos ;  which  is  far  less,  but  full  as  long-legged.  They  are %0abred  in  Egypt,  and  stand  upon  three  Toes.  Their  chief %0afeeding  is  upon  Flies.  In  Italy  they  will  not  live  many %0aDays.  All  the  heavier  Fowls  live  on  Fruits.  They  that  fly %0ahigh  prey  only  upon  Flesh.  Among  Water-fowls  the  Mergi %0aare  accustomed  to  devour  what  other  Birds  disgorge.  The %0aOnocrotali3  much  resemble  Swans,  and  they  might  be %0athought  to  be  not  altogether  different,  but  that  they  have %0awithin  their  Throat  another  kind  of  Receptacle,  into  which %0athese  insatiable  Fowls  gather  all  they  can  get,  so  wonderful %0ais  its  Capacity.  Now  when  they  have  accomplished  their %0aRavening,  they  return  it  from  thence  by  little  and  little  into %0atheir  Mouth,  from  whence  it  is  conveyed  to  the  true  Belly, %0aafter  the  manner  of  a  ruminating  Creature.  These  Fowls  are %0asent  from  the  parts  of  Gallia  lying  nearest  the  North  Ocean. %0aIn  Hercinia,  a  thick  Forest  of  Germany,  we  have  heard  that %0athere  are  unaccustomed  kinds  of  Birds,  with  Feathers  shin- %0aing like  Fire4  by  Night.  In  other  respects,  I  have  nothing  to %0asay  of  them  worth  the  Writing,  except  that  they  are  of  some %0aExcellency  for  being  brought  from  far. %0a%0a1  Fulica  porphyrio,  LINN.

Again,  the %0aPhasianse2  of  Colchis,  which  have  two  Ears,  consisting  of %0aFeathers,  which  they  set  up  and  lay  down  :  the  Numidian %0aFowls,  in  a  part  of  Africa  called  Numiclia,  as  also  throughout %0aItaly.  Apicius,  the  deepest  of  all  Gluttons,  taught  that  the %0aTongue  of  the  Phoenicopterus,3  was  a  most  delicate  piece  of %0aMeat.  The  Attagen4  of  Ionia  is  very  much  commended. %0aWhen  this  Bird  is  taken,  she  becomes  mute;  but  otherwise %0ashe  is  vocal :  and  in  old  Time  she  was  reputed  a  rare  Bird. %0aBut  now  they  are  caught  in  Gallia  and  Hispania,  and  also %0aamong  the  Alps  :  where  also  are  the  Phalacracoraces,5  which %0awere  peculiar  to  the  Balearic  Islands :  as  the  Pyrrhocorax6 %0awith  the  yellow  Bill,  was  (supposed  to  breed  only)  among %0athe  Alps;  and  the  Lagopus,7  a  dainty  Bird  for  the /Table. %0aThis  Name  it  took,  because  its  Feet  are  covered  with  Hair %0alike  the  Hare's-foot :  otherwise  it  is  all  over  white,  and  of %0athe  size  of  a  Pigeon.

They  are  a  kind  of  Turdi,  somewhat  less  than  House- %0apigeons  (Columbse),  pleasant  to  eat.  The  Balearic  Islands %0asend  us  another  Porphyrio,  better  than  that  before-named.1 %0aThere  also  the  Buzzard  (Buteo),  a  kind  of  Hawk,  is  held  as %0aexcellent  for  the  Table.  Likewise  the  Vipio,  for  so  they  call %0athe  lesser  Crane.  As  for  the  Fowls  called  Pegasi,  with %0aHeads  like  Horses';  and  the  Gryphae  (Griffins),  with  long %0aEars  and  a  hooked  Beak,  I  take  them  to  be  Fables  :  and  yet %0athey  say  that  the  Pegasi  are  in  Scythia,  and  the  Gryphae %0a(Griffins)  in  Ethiopia.  Moreover,  I  think  the  same  of  the %0aTragopanades,  which  many  affirm  to  be  greater  than  the %0aEagle,  having  crooked  Horns  on  each  side  of  the  Head,  of %0athe  colour  of  Iron,  and  the  Head  only  purple.  Neither  do %0athe  Syrens  obtain  Faith,  although  Dino,  the  Father  of %0aClitarthus  the  celebrated  Writer,  affirms  that  they  exist  in %0aIndia:  and  that  with  their  Singing  they  will  lull  People  into %0adeep  Sleep,  and  then  tear  them  in  Pieces.  He  that  will %0agive  Credit  to  these  Things  will  not  deny  that  Dragons,  in %0aTruth,  taught  Melampus,  by  licking  his  Ears,  to  understand %0athe  Language  of  Birds;  or  the  Things  that  Democritas %0atelleth,  who  nameth  the  Birds,  of  whose  Blood  mingled %0atogether  there  is  engendered  a  Serpent ;  which  whoever %0aeateth  shall  know  what  Birds  say  one  to  another:  and  the %0aThings  he  telleth  particularly  of  that  one  Bird,  the  Galerita : 2 %0aalthough  without  these  there  is  an  immense  Collection  to %0a%0aO %0a%0aoccupy  Life  about  Auguries.

And  therefore  it  is  better %0ato  write  of  those  we  certainly  know. %0a%0aCHAPTER  L. %0a%0aWho  first  invented  to  cram  Hens.     Of  Aviaries,  and  who  first %0ainvented  them. %0a%0aTHE  Inhabitants  of  Delos  began  the  cramming  of  Hens. %0aAnd  from  thence  arose  that  Plague  of  eating  the  Birds  so %0afat,  as  to  be  larded  with  their  own  Body.  Among  the  old %0aStatutes  ordained  to  repress  inordinate  Suppers,  I  find  in %0aone  Law  made  by  C.  Fannius,  the  Consul,  eleven  Years  be- %0afore the  third  Punic  War,  That  no  Man  should  place  (on  his %0aTable)  more  than  one  Hen,  which  should  not  be  fattened  ; %0awhich  Head  or  Injunction  was  afterwards  taken  from  this %0aand  inserted  in  all  the  other  Laws.  But  a  Bye-path  was %0afound  out  to  deceive  the  Meaning,  by  feeding  the  Barn-door %0aFowls  also  with  a  Paste  soaked  in  Milk,  by  which  their %0aFlesh  was  rendered  much  more  tender.  It  is  not  always %0athat  Hens  only  are  selected  for  fattening ;  but  they  are  only %0athought  well  crammed  when  they  are  fat  in  the  Skin  about %0athe  Neck.  Afterwards  the  Skill  of  the  Cooks  began  to  look %0ato  their  Haunches  ;  and  that  they  may  be  divided  along  the %0aChine,  and  be  extended  from  one  Leg,  so  as  to  take  up  the %0awhole  Sideboard.  The  Parthians  also  have  taught  our %0aCooks  their  Fashions.  And  yet  for  all  this  fine  dressing %0aout  of  Meat,  there  is  nothing  that  wholly  pleaseth ;  for  one %0apraises  nothing  but  the  Haunch,  and  in  another  Place  the %0aBreast  only  is  commended.  The  first  that  invented  an %0aAviary  in  which  to  shut  up  all  kinds  of  Fowls,  was  M.  Lenius %0a%0a1  The  Scops  is  described  by  ^Elian  (B.  xv.  ch.  xxviii.)  as  a  very  small- %0aeared  owl,  of  a  lead  colour,  with  white  spots.  The  ridiculous  gesticu- %0alations which  were  doubted  by  Pliny,  are  affirmed  by  ^Elian ;  who  says %0athat  fowlers  imitated  them,  and  by  so  doing  attracted  its  attention,  and %0asucceeded  in  catching  it.â€” -Wern.

And  by %0ahis  Example  we  began  to  confine  Animals  within  Prisons  ;^ %0ato  which  Creatures  Nature  had  assigned  the  wide  Air. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LI. %0aOf  jEsop's  Platter. %0a%0aBUT  in  this  Relation  the  most  distinguished  is  the %0aPlatter  of  Clodius  JEsopus,  the  Actor  of  Tragedies ;  which %0awas  valued  at  six  hundred  Sestertia.1  In  this  he  served  up %0aall  kind  of  Birds  remarkable  for  Song  or  capable  of  human %0aSpeech ;  and  they  cost  him  six  hundred  Sesterces  a-piece. %0aAnd  it  was  no  Pleasure  that  guided  him  in  this,  beyond  the %0aFact  that  he  would  eat  the  Imitators  of  Man  :  without  any %0aConsideration  that,  in  Truth,  all  his  own  rich  Revenues  had %0abeen  procured  by  his  Tongue  :  a  Father  verily  worthy  of  a %0aSon  who,  as  we  said  before,  devoured  those  Pearls.2  And, %0ato  speak  the  Truth,  it  is  hard  to  judge  which  of  the  two %0acommitted  the  greatest  Baseness ;  unless  that  it  is  less  to %0asup  on  the  greatest  Riches  of  Nature  than  on  Men's %0aTongues. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LII. %0a%0aThe  Generation  of  Birds ;  and  besides  Birds,  what  four- %0afooted  Beasts  lay  Eggs. %0a%0aTHE  Generation  of  Birds  seemeth  to  be  simple ;  and  yet %0atherein  are  to  be  found  some  wonderful  Things.  For  four- %0afooted  Animals  also  produce  Eggs ;  as  Chamaeleons,  Lizards, %0aand  such  as  we  named  among  Serpents.  Of  Fowls,  those %0athat  have  hooked  Claws  are  less  fertile,  and  among  these, %0aonly  the  Cenchris  layeth  above  four.  Nature  hath  assigned %0athis  to  the  Class  of  Fowls,  that  the  Powerful  should  be  less %0afruitful  than  those  which  fly  from  the  others.

Their  Embrace  is  performed  two %0aWays:  for  either  the  Female  croucheth  to  the  Ground,  as  do %0athe  Hens  ;  or  they  stand  up,  as  the  Cranes.  Of  Eggs,  some %0aare  white,  as  those  of  Doves  and  Partridges;  others  are  pale, %0aas  those  of  Water-fowl :  some  spotted,  as  in  the  Turkey- %0ahens  (Meleager),  others,  again,  reddish ;  as  those  of  Phea- %0asants (Phasiani),  and  Cenchrides. %0a%0aAll  Birds'  Eggs  within  the  Shell  are  of  two  Colours.  In %0aWater-fowls,  the  Yolk  is  more  than  the  White,  and  the  same %0ais  more  duskish  than  in  others.  The  Eggs  of  Fishes  are  of %0aone  Colour,  and  in  them  there  is  no  White.  Birds'  Eggs  are %0abrittle,  by  reason  of  the  Heat :  Serpents'  Eggs  are  more %0atough,  because  of  the  Cold  :  but  those  of  Fishes  are  soft, %0afrom  the  Liquid.  Those  of  such  Creatures  as  live  in  Water %0aare  round  :  others  are,  for  the  most  part,  pointed  at  the  top. %0aBirds  lay  their  Eggs  with  the  roundest  End  foremost :  the %0aShell  being  soft;  but  presently  they  harden  according  as  the %0aPortions  protrude.  Horatius  Flaccus  is  of  opinion,  that  the %0alonger  the  Egg  is,  the  better  they  taste.  The  rounder  Eggs %0aproduce  Hens,  the  others  yield  Cocks.  The  Navel  of  the  Egg %0ais  beneath  the  top ;  or  it  is  a  prominent  Drop  in  the  Shell. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIII. %0a%0aThe  Propagation  of  Eggs :  the  Sitting  of  Birds,  and  their %0amanner  of  Embrace. %0a%0aSOME  Birds   associate  in  breeding  at  all  Times  of  the %0a%0aO %0a%0aYear,  as  the  Barn-door  Fowls ;  and  they  lay  with  only  the %0aIntermission  of  two  Months  in  Mid-winter.  Of  those,  Pul- %0alets lay  more  than  old  Hens,  but  the  Eggs  are  less,  espe- %0acially the  first  and  last.  So  fruitful  are  they,  that  some  of %0athem  will  lay  threescore  Eggs:  some  lay  every  Day;  others, %0atwice  a  Day  :  and  some  will  so  over-lay,  that  they  become %0aworn  out,  and  die.  The  Hens  called  Hadrianae  are  ac- %0acounted best.  Doves  (Columbse)  lay  ten  Times  in  the  Year, %0aand  sometimes  eleven :  and  in  Egypt  they  continue  even  in %0a%0a1  What  these  are  seems  uncertain.     Holland  supposed  them  Linnets. %0aâ€”  Wern.

They  are  higher %0a%3c than  a  Man  sitting  on  Horseback ;  and  they  are %0a%3c also  swifter  than  a  Horse  :  their  Wings  being %0a%3c only  given  them  to  help  them  in  running ;  for  otherwise %0a%3c they  do  not  fly,  nor  do  they  even  rise  from  the  Ground. %0a%3c They  have  Hoofs  like  Deer,  and  with  them  they  fight ;  for %0a%3c as  they  are  cloven,  they  serve  to  catch  up  Stones,  which %0a%3c with  their  Legs  they  hurl  back  in  their  Flight  against  those %0a%3c that  chase  them.  It  is  a  Wonder  in  their  Nature,  that %0a%3c whatever  they  eat,  although  it  is  without  choice,  they  digest. %0a%3c But  their  Stupidity  is  not  less  remarkable ;  for,  high  as  the %0a%3c rest  of  their  Body  is,  if  they  hide  their  Head  and  Neck  in  a %0a%3c Bush,  they  think  themselves  altogether  concealed.

I %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Phoenix  is  one  of  the  most  renowned  of  the  fabulous  creatures %0a%3c of  antiquity.  The  first  detailed  description  and  history  of  this  bird  that %0a%3c we  meet  with  is  in  Herodotus  (Lib.  ii.  cap.  Ixxiii.),  whose  story  is  sub- %0a%3c stantially the  same  as  what  was  afterwards,  though  with  various  embel- %0a%3c lishments, repeated  and  believed  for  more  than  a  thousand  years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  passage  in  which  Tacitus  notices  the  Phoenix  is  very  remarkable, %0a%3c and  deserves  to  be  quoted  at  length,  as  being  the  most  authentic  account %0a%3c of  it  that  has  been  preserved,  and  also  as  showing  that  so  cautious  and %0a%3c accurate  a  man  as  he  is  always  considered  to  be,  entertained  no  kind  of %0a%3c doubt  as  to  its  real  existence,  and  its  periodical  appearance  in  Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c "  A.U  c.  787,  A.B.  34.  Paulus  Fabius  and  Lucius  Vitellius  succeeded %0a%3c to  the  consulship.  In  the  course  of  the  year  the  miraculous  bird,  known %0a%3c to  the  world  by  the  name  of  the  Phoenix,  after  disappearing  for  a  series %0a%3c of  ages,  revisited  Egypt.  A  phenomenon  so  very  extraordinary  could %0a%3c not  fail  to  produce  abundance  of  speculation.  The  learning  of  Egypt  was %0a%3c displayed,  and  Greece  exhausted  her  ingenuity.  The  facts,  about  which %0a%3c there  seems  to  be  a  concurrence  of  opinions,  with  other  circumstances,  in %0a%3c their  nature  doubtful  yet  worthy  of  notice,  will  not  be  unwelcome  to  the %0a%3c reader.  That  the  Phoenix  is  sacred  to  the  sun,  and  differs  from  the  rest %0a%3c of  the  feathered  species  in  the  form  of  its  head,  and  the  tincture  of  its %0a%3c plumage,  are  points  settled  by  the  naturalists.  Of  its  longevity  the %0a%3c accounts  are  various.  The  common  persuasion  is,  that  it  lives  five %0a%3c hundred  years,  though  by  some  writers  the  date  is  extended  to  four- %0a%3c teen hundred  and  sixty- one.  The  several  eras  when  the  Phoenix  has %0a%3c been  seen  are  fixed  by  tradition.  The  first,  we  are  told,  was  in  the  reign %0a%3c of  Sesostris ;  the  second  in  that  of  Amasis ;  and  in  the  period  when %0a%3c Ptolemy,  the  third  of  the  Macedonian  race,  was  seated  on  the  throne  of %0a%3c Egypt,  another  Phoenix  directed  his  flight  towards  Heliopolis,  attended %0a%3c by  a  group  of  various  birds,  all  attracted  by  the  novelty,  and  gazing  with %0a%3c wonder  at  so  beautiful  an  appearance.  For  the  truth  of  this  account  we %0a%3c do  not  presume  to  answer.  The  facts  lie  too  remote ;  and,  covered  as %0a%3c they  are  with  the  mists  of  antiquity,  all  further  argument  is  suspended. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ROOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  1 87 %0a%3c %0a%3c can  scarcely  tell  whether  it  be  false  or  no,  that  there  is  never %0a%3c more  than  one  of  them  in  the  whole  World,  and  that  it  is %0a%3c very  rarely  seen,  ft  is  said  to  be  of  the  size  of  an  Eagle : %0a%3c as  bright  as  Gold  about  the  Neck;  the  rest  of  the  Body %0a%3c purple  :  the  Tail  azure  blue,  with  Feathers  distinguished  by %0a%3c being  of  a  Rose-colour ;  and  the  Head  and  Face  adorned %0a%3c with  a  Crest  of  Feathers  on  the  top.  Manilius,  the  noble %0a%3c Senator,  excellently  well  versed  in  most  kinds  of  Learning, %0a%3c by  his  own  unassisted  Efforts  was  the  first  and  most  diligent %0a%3c %0a%3c From  the  reign  of  Ptolemy  to  Tiberius,  the  intermediate  space  is  not %0a%3c quite  two  hundred  and  fifty  years.  From  that  circumstance  it  has  been %0a%3c inferred  by  many  that  the  last  Phoenix  was  neither  of  the  genuine  kind, %0a%3c nor  came  from  the  woods  of  Arabia.  The  instinctive  qualities  of  the %0a%3c species  were  not  observed  to  direct  its  motions.  It  is  the  genius,  we  are %0a%3c told,  of  the  true  Phoenix,  when  its  course  of  years  is  finished,  and  the %0a%3c approach  of  death  is  felt,  to  build  a  nest  in  its  native  clime,  and  there %0a%3c deposit  the  principles  of  life,  from  which  a  new  progeny  arises.  The %0a%3c first  care  of  the  young  bird,  as  soon  as  fledged,  and  able  to  trust  to  its %0a%3c wings,  is  to  perform  the  obsequies  of  its  father.  But  this  duty  is  not %0a%3c undertaken  rashly.  He  collects  a  great  quantity  of  myrrh,  and  to  try  his %0a%3c strength,  makes  frequent  excursions  with  a  load  on  his  back.  When  he %0a%3c has  made  his  experiment  through  a  long  tract  of  air,  and  gains  sufficient %0a%3c confidence  in  his  own  vigour,  he  takes  up  the  body  of  his  father,  and  flies %0a%3c with  it  to  the  altar  of  the  sun,  where  he  leaves  it  to  be  consumed  in  flames %0a%3c of  fragrance.  Such  is  the  account  of  this  extraordinary  bird.  It  has,  no %0a%3c doubt,  a  mixture  of  fable ;  but  that  the  Phoenix,  from  time  to  time, %0a%3c appears  in  Egypt,  seems  to  be  a  fact  satisfactorily  ascertained." â€” MURPHY'S %0a%3c "Tacitus"  Annals^  Book  vi.  sect.  28.  The  concluding  paragraph  of  this %0a%3c second  chapter  of  Pliny  is  the  best  comment  on  this  passage  of  Tacitus. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  fable  of  the  Phoenix,  however,  is  not  only  found  in  heathen  au- %0a%3c thors, but  is  mentioned  and  believed  by  many  of  the  Jewish  Rabbinical %0a%3c writers  also,  and  even  by  some  of  the  early  Fathers  of  the  Christian %0a%3c Church.  Nor  are  accounts  of  it  wanting  in  modern  authors,  even  down %0a%3c to  so  late  a  period  as  the  middle  of  the  seventeenth  century ;  for  Sir %0a%3c Thomas  Brown,  in  the  12th  chap,  of  the  3d  book  of  his  "Vulgar %0a%3c Errors,"  thinks  it  necessary  to  state,  at  some  length,  his  reasons  for  disbe- %0a%3c lieving the  existence  of  the  Phoenix.  Cuvier  is  of  opinion  that  the %0a%3c original  description  of  the  Phoenix  might  have  been  taken  from  the %0a%3c Phasianus  pictus,  a  native  of  China;  which,  if  it  ever  once  flew  into %0a%3c Egypt,  would  be  a  sufficient  foundation  for  the  portent.

[BooK  X. %0a%3c %0a%3c of  the  long  Robe  (Toga),  who  wrote  of  this  Bird ;  and  he %0a%3c reporteth,  that  no  Man  was  ever  known  to  see  him  feeding : %0a%3c that  in  Arabia  he  is  sacred  to  the  Sun  :  that  he  liveth  660 %0a%3c Years:  and  when  he  groweth  old,  he  builds  a  Nest  with  the %0a%3c Twigs  of  Cassia  (Cinnamon)  and  Frankincense  Trees :  and %0a%3c when  he  hath  filled  it  with  Spices,  he  dieth  upon  it.  He %0a%3c saith,  also,  that  out  of  his  Bones  and  Marrow  there  breedeth %0a%3c at  first,  as  it  were,  a  little  Worm,  from  which  proceeds  a %0a%3c young  Bird  ;  and  the  first  Thing  this  young  one  does,  is  to %0a%3c perform  the  Funeral  Rites  of  the  former  Phoenix,  and  then %0a%3c to  carry  away  the  whole  Nest  to  the  City  of  the  Sun,  near %0a%3c Panchaea,  and  to  lay  it  down  upon  the  Altar.  The  same %0a%3c Manilius  affirmeth,  that  the  Revolution  of  the  great  Year %0a%3c agreeth  with  the  Life  of  this  Bird ;  in  which  Year  the  same %0a%3c Signification  of  the  Times  and  Stars  return  again  to  their %0a%3c first  Points  :  and  that  this  should  begin  at  Noon,  that  very %0a%3c Day  when  the  Sun  entereth  the  Sign  Aries.  And  by  his %0a%3c saying,  the  Year  of  that  Revolution  was  by  him  showed %0a%3c when  P.  Licinius  and  M .  Cornelius  were  Consuls.  Cornelius %0a%3c Valerianus  writeth,  that  while  Q.  Plautius  and  Sex.  Papinius %0a%3c were  Consuls,  the  Phcenix  flew  into  Egypt.  He  was  con- %0a%3c veyed to  the  City  (Rome)  in  the  Time  that  Claudius  the %0a%3c Prince  was  Censor,  in  the  eight  hundredth  Year  of  the  City, %0a%3c and  was  showed  openly  in  the  Assembly  of  the  People,  as %0a%3c appeareth  in  the  Public  Records ;  but  no  Man  ever  made %0a%3c any  doubt  that  this  was  a  counterfeit  Phoenix. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  III. %0a%3c Of  Eagles.* %0a%3c %0a%3c OF  all  the  Birds  we  know,  the  Eagles  excel  both  in %0a%3c Honour  and  Strength.  There  are  six  Kinds  of  them.  The %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  his  account  of  the  Eagles,  when  Pliny  does  not  follow  Aristotle, %0a%3c he  may  have  been  chiefly  led  by  the  authority  of  the  books  of  the %0a%3c Augurs;  to  whom  the  appearance  of  all  strange  birds  was  officially %0a%3c reported,  and  whose  office  led  them  to  study  minutely  their  habits.  The %0a%3c absence  of  description  in  their  writings  is  explained  by  the  fact,  that  their %0a%3c books  contained  coloured  figures  of  all  the  species  that  came  within  their %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  1 89 %0a%3c %0a%3c first  named  by  the  Greeks  Melanaetos,  which  is  the  same  as %0a%3c Valeria :  the  least  in  size,  but  the  strongest,  and  in  Colour %0a%3c black :  in  the  whole  Race  of  Eagles,  she  alone  feedeth  her %0a%3c young :  for  the  rest  (as  we  shall  say  hereafter)  beat  them %0a%3c away :  she  only  crieth  not,  nor  keepeth  a-grumbling ;  and %0a%3c she  keepeth  commonly  on  the  Mountains.  Of  the  second %0a%3c Sort  is  Pygargus.  It  keepeth  about  Towns  and  Plains,  and %0a%3c hath  a  whitish  Tail.  The  third  is  Morphnos,  which  Homer %0a%3c calleth  also  Percnos.  Some  name  it  Plancns  and  Anataria:1 %0a%3c the  second  in  Bigness  and  Strength,  loving  to  live  about %0a%3c Lakes.  Phcemonne,  who  was  said  to  be  the  Daughter  of %0a%3c Apollo,  hath  reported,  that  this  Eagle  has  Teeth ;  otherwise %0a%3c mute,  and  without  Tongue  :  also,  of  all  others  she  is  the %0a%3c blackest,  and  hath  the  longest  Tail.  With  this  agrees %0a%3c Botthius.  She  is  subtle ;  for  when  she  hath  seized  on  Tor- %0a%3c toises, she  throweth  them  down  from  aloft  to  break  their %0a%3c Shells.  It  was  the  Fortune  of  the  Poet  ^Eschylus  to  die  by %0a%3c such  Means.  For  it  is  said  to  have  been  foretold  by  the %0a%3c Fates  that  he  should  be  killed  on  a  given  Day  by  something %0a%3c falling  from  the  Sky  ;  which  he  guarded  against  by  trusting %0a%3c to  the  Safety  of  the  open  Sky.  Of  the  fourth  Kind  is  Perc- %0a%3c nopterus,  the  same  as  Oripelargus ,  a  kind  of  Vulture  with %0a%3c very  small  Wings,  a  Body  bigger  than  the  rest ;  but  a  very %0a%3c %0a%3c notice.  It  is  also  probable,  from  Ch.  xv.,  that  the  works  of  the  ancient %0a%3c naturalists  were  illustrated  with  representations  of  the  objects  referred  to, %0a%3c although  no  such  copies  have  come  down  to  our  times. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eagles:  Malanaetos,  Valeria;  Falco  fulims,  Cuv.

[BooK  X. %0a%3c %0a%3c Coward,  and  of  an  inferior  Race,  for  a  Raven  will  buffet  her. %0a%3c She  hath  a  greedy  Appetite,  and  a  continued  whining  Mur- %0a%3c mur. Of  all  the  Eagles  she  only  carrieth  away  the  dead  Prey  ; %0a%3c whereas  when  the  others  have  killed  it,  they  settled  upon %0a%3c it.  This  Kind  causeth  the  fifth  to  be  called  Gnesws,  as  being %0a%3c the  true,  and  the  only  one  of  pure  descent.  This  Eagle  is  of %0a%3c a  middle  size,  of  a  reddish  Colour,  and  rare  to  be  seen. %0a%3c There  remaineth  the  Haliaetos ;  which  hath  the  sharpest %0a%3c Sight  of  all  others,  poising  herself  on  high  ;  and  when  she %0a%3c spieth  a  Fish  in  the  Sea,  down  she  comes  upon  it  with  a %0a%3c Rush,  and  dashes  the  Waves  aside  with  her  Breast  as  she %0a%3c snatcheth  it  up.  That  Eagle  which  we  have  made  the  third, %0a%3c haunteth  standing  Waters  to  prey  upon  Water-fowl,  which %0a%3c now  and  then  dive  under  the  Water  ;  but  she  seizeth  them %0a%3c as  they  become  wearied  and  confounded.  The  Contest  is %0a%3c worth  looking  at ;  while  the  Bird  endeavours  to  gain  the %0a%3c Shore  for  Refuge,  especially  if  it  be  well  covered  with  thick %0a%3c Reeds,  and  the  Eagle  for  her  Part  drives  her  from  thence %0a%3c with  a  Blow  of  the  Wing  ;  and  whilst  the  Eagle  striketh, %0a%3c and  in  so  doing  falleth  into  the  Lake,  the  Fowl  that  swim- %0a%3c meth  beneath  the  Water,  seeing  the  Shadow  of  the  Eagle %0a%3c hovering  about  the  Shore,  riseth  up  again  in  another  Place, %0a%3c where  her  Pursuer  could  least  have  looked  for  her.  This  is %0a%3c the  Cause  why  these  Wild-fowl  commonly  swim  in  Flocks ; %0a%3c for  when  they  are  many  together,  they  are  not  troubled, %0a%3c because  with  dashing  the  Water  with  their  Wings,  they %0a%3c dazzle  the  Sight  of  their  Enemy.  Often,  also,  the  very %0a%3c Eagles,  not  able  to  bear  up  the  Weight  they  have  seized,  are %0a%3c drawn  under  the  Water  with  it.  The  Haliceetos  only,  before %0a%3c her  young  ones  are  yet  feathered,  beats  them,  and  thereby %0a%3c forces  them  to  look  full  against  the  Sunbeams;  and  if  she %0a%3c notices  any  one  of  them  to  wink,  or  their  Eyes  to  water,  she %0a%3c throws  it  out  of  the  Nest,  as  a  bastard  and  inferior  Sort ; %0a%3c but  she  educates  that  one  whose  Eye-sight  is  strong  enough %0a%3c to  sustain  the  Gaze.  Haliceeti  are  not  a  separate  Kind  of %0a%3c Eagles,  but  proceed  from  the  coupling  of  different  Sorts. %0a%3c And  that  Kind  which  is  produced  by  them  is  regarded  as  a %0a%3c Sort  of  Ossifragus  ;  from  which  are  propagated  the  lesser %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BooKX.]  History  of  Nature.  191 %0a%3c %0a%3c Vultures ;  and  they  again  the  greater,  which  propagate %0a%3c none  whatever.  Some  add  a  Kind  of  Eagle  which  they  call %0a%3c Barbatae,  and  the  Tuscans  Ossifragae. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  the  three  first  and  the  fifth  Kind  of  Eagles  have  in %0a%3c their  Nest  a  Stone  named  JEetites,1  which  some  call  Gagates ; %0a%3c of  extensive  use  as  a  Medicine,  and  suffering  no  Injury  from %0a%3c Fire.  Now  this  Stone  is  also  pregnant ;  for  if  it  is  shaken, %0a%3c another  is  heard  to  rattle  within,  as  if  it  were  in  its  Womb. %0a%3c But  that  medical  Virtue  is  not  in  these  Stones  if  they  are  not %0a%3c taken  away  out  of  the  very  Nest.  They  make  their  Nests  in %0a%3c Rocks  and  upon  Trees :  they  lay  three  Eggs,  but  two  only %0a%3c are  hatched :  but  sometimes  they  have  been  seen  to  have %0a%3c three  young  ones.  But  one  of  them  they  turn  out  of  the %0a%3c Nest,  because  they  will  not  be  troubled  with  feeding  it.  And %0a%3c truly  Nature  hath  well  provided  that  at  such  a  Time  they %0a%3c shall  not  be  able  to  provide  Meat ;  for  otherwise  they  were %0a%3c enough  to  destroy'all  the  Young  of  the  wild  Beasts.  Also  at %0a%3c this  Time  their  Talons  are  bent  inward;  and  through  Hunger %0a%3c their  Feathers  grow  white,  so  that  they  have  good  Cause  to %0a%3c hate  their  Young.  But  when  they  have  cast  them  off,  the %0a%3c Ossifrages,  which  are  near  of  Kin  to  them,  receive  them  and %0a%3c bring  them  up  with  their  own  Birds.  But  the  parent  Eagles %0a%3c persecute  them  still  when  they  are  full  grown,  and  drive %0a%3c them  a  great  Way  off,  as  being  their  Rivals  in  the  Prey. %0a%3c And  were  it  not  so,  one  pair  of  Eagles  needeth  a  large  Ex- %0a%3c tent of  Country  to  furnish  them  with  sufficient  Food.  They %0a%3c have,  therefore,  their  several  Coasts  for  Prey,  and  do  not %0a%3c trespass  on  those  of  a  neighbouring  pair.  When  they  have %0a%3c seized  a  Prey,  they  do  not  carry  it  away  presently,  but  first %0a%3c lay  it  down,  and  try  the  Weight  before  they  fly  off  with  it. %0a%3c They  do  not  die  for  Age  or  Sickness,  but  of  Famine,  by  rea- %0a%3c son that  the  upper  Beak  of  their  Bill  so  far  overgrows  in- %0a%3c ward, that  the  Crookedness  does  not  permit  them  to  open  it.2 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  B.  xxx.  ch.  xiv. ;  B.  xxxvi.  ch.  xxi. ;  B.  xxxvii.  ch.  xi. â€”  Wern.

But %0a%3c %0a%3c Marius    rejected   them    altogether.      And    since    this    it   is %0a%3c %0a%3c observed  that  scarcely  is  there  a  Camp  of  a  Legion  wintered %0a%3c %0a%3c at  any  Time,  without  having  a  pair  of  Eagles. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Eagles,  the  first  and  second  Kind  do  not  prey  only %0a%3c upon  the  lesser  Quadrupeds,  but  also  maintain  Battle  with %0a%3c Deer.  She  walloweth  in  the  Dust  and  gathereth  a  great %0a%3c deal  of  it  among  her  Feathers,  and  then  settling  upon  the %0a%3c Horns  she  shakes  it  off  into  his  Eyes,  flapping  it  about  his %0a%3c Face  with  her  Wings,  until  she  drive  him  down  over  the %0a%3c Rocks.  Nor  is  one  Enemy  enough  for  the  Eagle  ;  but  her %0a%3c Fight  with  the  Dragon  is  more  sharp  and  much  more  dan- %0a%3c gerous, although  it  is  in  the  Air.  The  Dragon,  out  of  a %0a%3c greedy  Desire  to  do  Mischief,  watcheth  to  destroy  the  Eggs %0a%3c of  the  Eagle  ;  but  the  Eagle  again  for  this,  wherever  she %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Insignia  Draconarius.

At  length  the  young  Girl  died  ; %0a%3c and  when  her  Funeral-fire  was  set  a-burning,  the  Eagle %0a%3c threw  itself  on  it,  and  was  consumed  to  Ashes  with  her.  For %0a%3c which  Cause  the  Inhabitants  erected  in  that  Place  a  Monu- %0a%3c ment, such  as  they  call  Herou'm,  denominated  (the  Tomb)  of %0a%3c Jupiter  and  the  Virgin,  because  that  Bird  is  consecrated  to %0a%3c the  God. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Vultures. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  black  Vultures  are  the  best  of  that  kind  of  Birds. %0a%3c No  man  ever  could  meet  with  their  Nests;  and  therefore %0a%3c some  have  thought  (but  untruly)  that  they  fly  to  us  out  of %0a%3c an  opposite  World.  But  they  build  in  the  very  highest %0a%3c Rocks ;  and  their  young  ones  have  many  Times  been  seen, %0a%3c two  generally  together.  Umbricius,  who  was  the  most  skilful %0a%3c Aruspex  of  our  Age,  saith,  that  usually  they  lay  three  Eggs ; %0a%3c of  which  they  take  one  of  them  to  purify  the  other  Eggs  and %0a%3c the  Nest,  and  soon  after  they  cast  it  away :  also  that  they %0a%3c fly  two  or  three  days  before  to  the  place  where  there  will  be %0a%3c dead  Carcasses. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VII. %0a%3c Of  the  Sangualis  and  Tmmussulus. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Roman  Augurs  entertain  much  Doubt  concerning %0a%3c the  Sangualis  and  the  Immussulus.  Some  are  of  opinion %0a%3c that  the  Immussulus  is  the  Young  of  the  Vulture  :  and  the %0a%3c Sangualis,  the  Young  of  the  Ossifraga.  Massurius  saith, %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.  III.

Some  have  affirmed  confidently,  that %0a%3c after  (the  Death  of)  Mutius  the  Augur,  there  was  never  any %0a%3c of  them  seen  at  Rome  :  but  I  am  rather  of  Opinion  (as  being- %0a%3c nearest  the  Truth)  that,  through  the  supine  Negligence  of %0a%3c Men  in  all  Things,  they  do  not  know  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VIII. %0a%3c Of  the  Accipiter)  or  Hawk  kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c WE  find  sixteen  Kinds  of  Hawks:1  of  which  the  Circos, %0a%3c which  is  lame  of  one  Leg,  is  held  for  the  most  prosperous %0a%3c Augury  in  Treaties  of  Weddings  and  of  Cattle.  Also  the %0a%3c Triorches,  so  called  from  the  Number  of  its  Testicles,  to %0a%3c which  Phemonoe  hath  given  the  principal  Place  in  Au- %0a%3c gury. The  Romans  called  it  Buteo ;  and  there  is  still  a %0a%3c Family  surnamed  from  it,  because  it  had  settled  upon  the %0a%3c Admiral's  Ship,  with  favourable  Auspices.  The  Greeks %0a%3c name  that  Kind  YEsalo,  which  alone  is  seen  at  all  Times ; %0a%3c whereas  the  rest  are  gone  when  Winter  cometh.  Hawks  are %0a%3c divided  into  distinct  Kinds,  by  their  Greediness :  for  some %0a%3c never  seize  a  Fowl  but  upon  the  Ground  :  others,  again, %0a%3c never  attempt  a  Bird  except  it  is  flying  about  Trees :  and %0a%3c others  when  it  is  sitting  on  high :  and  some  when  they  fly  in %0a%3c the  open  Air.  Therefore  the  Pigeons,  knowing  the  Danger %0a%3c of  these  Things,  so  soon  as  they  espy  them,  either  alight %0a%3c upon  the  Ground,  or  else  fly  low  ;  and  thus  help  themselves %0a%3c in  a  contrary  Course  to  them.

'195 %0a%3c %0a%3c Island  of  Africa  called  Cerne,  in  which  all  the  Hawks  of %0a%3c Massesylige  build  their  Nests  on  the  Ground :  and  being %0a%3c accustomed  to  those  Nations,  they  do  not  breed  elsewhere. %0a%3c In  a  Part  of  Thracia  beyond  Ainphipolis,  Men  and  Hawks1 %0a%3c catch  Birds  together,  in  a  sort  of  Fellowship ;  for  the  Men %0a%3c drive  the  Birds  from  the  Woods  and  Reeds,  and  the  Hawks, %0a%3c flying  over  their  Heads,  bear  them  to  the  Ground.  On  the %0a%3c other  Side  the  Hawkers  divide  the  Prey  with  the  Hawks : %0a%3c and  by  Report  they  let  some  Birds  fly  again  aloft  into  the %0a%3c Air,  for  the  Hawks  to  catch  for  themselves.  When  the  Time %0a%3c of  Hawking  arrives,  they  will  by  their  Cry  and  Manner  of %0a%3c Flying  together  invite  them  to  take  the  Opportunity.  It  is %0a%3c said  that  Lupi  (Bass)  do  the  like,  about  the  Lake  Mceotis : %0a%3c for  unless  they  have  their  Part  with  the  Fishermen,  they %0a%3c tear  their  Nets  when  they  are  stretched  forth.  Hawks  do %0a%3c not  eat  the  Heart  of  any  Bird.  The  Night-Hawk  is  called %0a%3c Cymindis  :  it  is  seldom  seen  in  the  Woods,  and  by  Daylight %0a%3c seeth  little.  There  is  deadly  War  between  it  and  the  Eagle ; %0a%3c and  often  they  are  both  taken,  by  holding  fast  one  with  the %0a%3c other. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Coccyx,  which  usually  is  killed  by  Birds  of  its  own %0a%3c %0a%3c Kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Cuckoo2  appeareth  to  be  formed  of  an  Hawk, %0a%3c changed  in  its  Shape  at  one  certain  Time  of  the  Year :  for %0a%3c then  the  other  Hawks  are  not  to  be  seen,  unless  for  some %0a%3c very  few  Days.

Hence  the  Greeks  denominated  the %0a%3c falconry  hawks  Hierax,  and  the  falconer  Hieracaros;  although,  perhaps, %0a%3c this  idea  of  their  sacred  character  may  have  been  derived  from  Egypt, %0a%3c where  the  Accipiter  JEgyptius  was  so  deemed,  because  it  preyed  on  serpents. %0a%3c -  Wem.

The  ancient  opinion  that  this  bird  became  changed  into  a  Hawk, %0a%3c was  derived  from  the  fact  that  one  of  the  migratory  Hawks  appeared %0a%3c about  the  time  when  the  Cuckoo  departed.  â€”  Went.

It  is %0a%3c the  only  one  of  the  Hawks  that  hath  no  hooked  Talons,  nor %0a%3c is  its  Head  like  theirs,  nor  is  it  like  them  in  anything  but %0a%3c Colour  ;  and  the  Gape  of  the  Mouth  more  resembleth  that  of %0a%3c the  Dove.  Nay,  the  Hawk  will  devour  it  if  they  appear %0a%3c together ;  and  it  is  the  only  Bird  of  all  others  that  is  killed %0a%3c by  those  of  its  own  kind.  It  altereth  its  Voice  also.  In  the %0a%3c Spring  it  cometh  abroad,  and  at  the  rising  of  the  Dog-star  it %0a%3c hideth  itself.  It  lays  always  in  other  Birds'  Nests,  and  most %0a%3c of  all  in  the  Stock-doves',  commonly  one  Egg  only,  which %0a%3c no  other  Bird  doth  besides ;  and  seldom  two.  The  Reason %0a%3c why  they  place  their  Young  under  other  Birds  is  because %0a%3c they  know  that  all  Birds  hate  them,  for  even  little  Birds %0a%3c annoy  them  ;  therefore,  that  the  whole  Race  of  them  should %0a%3c not  be  utterly  destroyed,  they  make  no  Nest  of  their  own, %0a%3c being  otherwise  timorous  in  their  Nature.  The  Nurse,  there- %0a%3c fore, bringeth  up  the  substituted  Chick  in  the  adulterated %0a%3c Nest.  And  this  young  Cuckoo,  being  Greedy  by  Nature, %0a%3c intercepteth  the  Meat  from  the  other  young  Birds,  and  so %0a%3c groweth  fat ;  whereby  it  cometh  into  favour  with  the  Nurse. %0a%3c She  rejoiceth  in  its  Appearance,  and  wonders  at  herself  that %0a%3c she  hath  hatched  such  a  Chick.  The  rest,  which  are  her %0a%3c own,  she  condemns  in  comparison  with  this  one,  as  being %0a%3c Strangers,  and  suffereth  them  to  be  devoured  before  her %0a%3c Face;  and  at  last  the  young  Cuckoo,  being  able  to  fly, %0a%3c seizeth  also  her  Nurse.  And  by  that  Time  no  other  Bird %0a%3c is  to  be  compared  to  the  young  Cuckoo  for  Sweetness  of %0a%3c Flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  X. %0a%3c Of  the  Milvus.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Milvus  is  of  the  same  Kind  of  Hawks,  but  it  differs %0a%3c in  size.

These  Birds %0a%3c seem,  by  the  turning  of  their  Tails  to  and  fro,  to  have  taught %0a%3c the  Art  of  Steering  ;  Nature  showing  that  in  the  Air  which %0a%3c is  necessary  in  the  Deep  beneath  !  The  Milvus  also,  is  not %0a%3c seen  in  the  Winter  Months  ;  but  they  do  not  go  away  before %0a%3c the  Swallows.  Moreover,  it  is  said  that  after  the  Solstices %0a%3c they  are  troubled  with  the  Gout. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XI. %0a%3c Arrangement  of  Birds  into  Genera. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  first  Distinction  in  Birds  is  chiefly  taken  from  their %0a%3c Feet,  for  they  have  either  hooked  Talons  or  Toes ;  or  else %0a%3c they  are  in  some  sort  broad  arid  flat,  as  Geese,  and  almost %0a%3c all  the  Water-birds.  Those  which  have  hooked  Talons  for %0a%3c the  most  part  feed  only  upon  Flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XII. %0a%3c Of  unlucky  Birds  :  the  Comix,  Corvus,  and  Bubo. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Comix1  liveth  also  on  other  Food  :  for  when  they %0a%3c meet  with  a  hard  Nut  which  resists  their  Bill,  they  will  fly %0a%3c aloft  and  fling  it  against  the  Rocks  or  Tiles  many  Times %0a%3c together,  until  it  is  so  bruised  that  they  can  easily  break  it. %0a%3c This  Bird's  Chattering  is  inauspicious,  although  by  some  it %0a%3c is  praised.  It  is  observed,  that  from  the  (going  down)  of  the %0a%3c Star  Arcturus  to  the  coining  of  the  Swallow,  it  is  not  seen %0a%3c elsewhere  but  in  the  Groves  and  Temples  of  Minerva,  and %0a%3c that  but  seldom,  as  at  Athens.  Moreover,  this  Bird  only %0a%3c feedeth  her  Young  for  a  good  while  after  they  are  able  to %0a%3c fly.  She  is  most  unlucky  at  the  Time  of  Young,  that  is, %0a%3c after  the  Solstice.  All  other  Birds  of  the  same  Race  drive %0a%3c their  young  ones  out  of  the  Nest,  and  force  them  to  fly;  as %0a%3c the  Corvus  also,  which  likewise  feed  not  on  Flesh  only  ;  and %0a%3c they  likewise,  when  they  perceive  their  young  ones  to  be %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Comix :  Corvus  corone,  the  Crow.

Therefore  about  little  Vil- %0a%3c lages there  are  commonly  not  above  two  Pair  of  them.  And %0a%3c about  Cranon  in  Thessaly,  there  is  not  above  one  Pair  of %0a%3c them  :  for  the  Parents  yield  the  Place  to  the  Offspring. %0a%3c There  are  some  different  Properties  in  this  Bird,  and  that %0a%3c before-mentioned.  The  Corvi  breed  before  the  Solstice,  and %0a%3c for  sixty  Days  they  are  sick,  chiefly  with  Thirst,  until  the  Figs %0a%3c are  ripe  in  Autumn :  and  from  that  Time  the  Cornix  is  dis- %0a%3c eased. The  Corvus  for  the  most  part  layeth  five  Eggs,  and %0a%3c the  Vulgar  are  of  opinion  that  they  conceive  and  lay  Eggs  at %0a%3c the  Bill ;  and  therefore  if  Women  with  Child  eat  a  Raven's %0a%3c Egg,  they  shall  be  delivered  of  their  Children  at  the  Mouth: %0a%3c and  generally  they  have  difficult  Labour  if  such  an  Egg  be %0a%3c brought  into  the  House.  Aristotle  denieth  this :  no  more,  by %0a%3c Hercules,  than  the  Egyptian  Ibis  :  but  that  the  kissing  which %0a%3c we  see  them  do  often,  is  like  what  Pigeons  also  do.  The %0a%3c Corvi  alone  seem  to  have  a  Knowledge  of  their  own %0a%3c Significations  in  Presages;  for  when  the  Guests  of  Media %0a%3c were  all  slain,  they  all  flew  away  out  of  Peloponnesus %0a%3c and  the  Region  of  Attica.  The  worst  Signification  they %0a%3c afford  is  when  they  swallow  their  Voice  as  if  they  were %0a%3c choked. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Night-birds  have  also  crooked  Talons  ;  as  the  Noctua %0a%3c Bubo  and  Ulula.1  All  these  see  but  badly  in  the  Day-time. %0a%3c The  Bubo  betokeneth  Mourning,  and  is  most  execrable, %0a%3c especially  in  the  Presages  of  public  Affairs :  it  keepeth  in %0a%3c solitary  Places ;  and  not  desolate  only,  but  also  such  as  are %0a%3c horrible,  and  hard  of  access.  It  is  the  Monster  of  the  Night, %0a%3c not  uttering  a  clear  Sound,  but  muttering  a  Groan;  and %0a%3c therefore,  if  seen  in  Cities,  or  otherwise  abroad  in  the  Light, %0a%3c it  is  a  dreadful  Portent.  I  myself  know,  however,  that  it %0a%3c hath  perched  upon  many  Houses  of  private  Men,  and  yet %0a%3c no  deadly  Accident  followed.  It  never  flieth  directly  whi- %0a%3c ther it  would  itself  go,  but  is  carried  away  across.

But  what  Bird %0a%3c this  is,  neither  do  I  know  nor  yet  find  in  any  Writer.

Others  called  this  Bird  Spinturnix  ;  but  hitherto  I %0a%3c have  not  met  with  the  Man  who  would  say,  that  he  knew %0a%3c what  Bird  this  should  be. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Clivina. %0a%3c %0a%3c LIKEWISE  the  Bird  named  in  old  Time  Clivina,  which %0a%3c some  call  Clarnatoria,  and  Labeo  by  the  Name  of  Prohi- %0a%3c bitoria,  I  perceive  is  as  little  known  as  the  other.

He  reporteth %0a%3c %0a%3c averting  the  omen.  The  science  was  divided  into  two  portions :  one  of %0a%3c which  referred  to  the  auspices,  or  the  view  of  birds ;  and  the  other,  which %0a%3c more  especially  bore  the  name  of  augury  â€”  abavium  garritu  â€”  consisted %0a%3c in  attending  to  the  sounds  uttered  by  birds.  The  birds  themselves  that %0a%3c afforded  these  prognostications  were  supposed  to  be  moved  ab  anima %0a%3c sua,  by  an  inward  action  proceeding  from  the  influence  of  Deity :  those %0a%3c which  by  their  singing  attracted  the  attention  of  the  augurs,  were  termed %0a%3c Oscines  (Ch.  xxix.)  :  a  name  which  thus  became  a  denomination  for  all %0a%3c singing-birds  :  such  as  were  supposed  to  signify  that  an  action  ought  not %0a%3c to  be  persevered  in  were  called  Prohibltorice  (Ch.  xiv.),  and  the  word %0a%3c obscene  was  simply  descriptive  of  birds  of  ill  omen,  although  the  term %0a%3c has  been  subsequently  applied  with  another  meaning.  A  journal  of  the %0a%3c transactions  of  this  college  of  religious  naturalists  was  kept  of  the  occur- %0a%3c rence of  every  rare  event,  and  the  appearance  of  every  strange  bird, %0a%3c coloured  representations  of  which  were  drawn,  for  reference  on  any  future %0a%3c emergency.  For  the  conveniency  of  official  observation,  a  measured %0a%3c space,  termed  Pomarium,  round  the  walls  of  the  city,  and  separating  it %0a%3c from  the  country,  was  kept  free  from  buildings  or  enclosures ;  and  the %0a%3c Palatine  hill  of  Rome  was  in  old  time  excluded  from  the  city  and  the %0a%3c Pornserium,  because  it  was  the  resort  of  birds  of  ill  omen.  Spaces  in  the %0a%3c sky  were  measured  out  by  the  official  staff;  and  the  birds  themselves %0a%3c were  arranged  in  classes,  to  render  the  rules  of  prognostication  more  pre- %0a%3c cise. An  augur  who  entered  into  the  spirit  of  his  profession  was  neces- %0a%3c sarily skilful  in  ornithology ;  but  those  who  were  more  speculative  would %0a%3c make  additions  to  species  or  classes,  whic'h  the  experience  of  others  would %0a%3c fail  to  confirm.  The  public  terror  was  thus  entirely  in  the  power  of  the %0a%3c augurs,  for  even  a  slight  change  of  structure,  discovered  when  the  bird %0a%3c was  cut  asunder  for  sacrifice,  was  deemed  a  portent :  and  there  are  proofs %0a%3c that  some  among  them  might  be  induced  to  shape  their  reports  in %0a%3c a  manner  to  suit  private  purposes.  The  opinion  of  Accius  on  augurs  is %0a%3c thus  given : â€” %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Nihil  credo  auguribus,  qui  aures  verbis  divitant %0a%3c %0a%3c Alienas,  suas  ut  auro  locupletent  domos." %0a%3c â€”  Went.

They  that %0a%3c peck  Holes  in  Trees,  and  climb  in  a  pilfering  Way  like %0a%3c Cats,  are  of  this  Race.

And  one  Presage  of %0a%3c theirs  I  cannot  pass  over :  one  of  them  alighted  upon  the %0a%3c Head  of  L.  Tubero,  Praetor  of  the  City,  as  he  was  distri- %0a%3c buting Justice  on  the  Judgment-seat  in  the  Forum,  and %0a%3c there  rested  so  gently,  that  it  suffered  him  to  take  it  with  his %0a%3c Hand.  The  Prophet  answered,  that  if  the  Bird  were  let  go %0a%3c it  would  portend  the  Ruin  of  the  Empire  ;  but  if  it  were %0a%3c killed,  it  denounced  Death  to  the  Praetor ;  and  he  immediately %0a%3c tore  the  Bird  in  pieces :  nor  was  it  long  before  the  Prodigy %0a%3c was  fulfilled.  There  are  also  some  of  this  Kind  that  feed %0a%3c upon  Mast,  and  many  on  Apples;  but  they  do  not  live  on %0a%3c Flesh  only,  except  the  Milvus,  which  causes  that  Bird  to  be %0a%3c mournful  in  Auguries. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIX. %0a%3c Of  Birds  that  have  hooked  Talons  and  Fingers. %0a%3c %0a%3c THOSE  which  have  crooked  Claws  do  not  assemble  in %0a%3c Flocks,  but  prey  each  one  for  itself.

They %0a%3c are  Rulers  of  their  own  Kind  ;  and  in  whatever  House  they %0a%3c are,  they  exercise  Sovereignty.  This  is  gotten  by  fighting %0a%3c one  with  another,  as  if  they  knew  that  naturally  they  had %0a%3c Weapons  given  them  on  their  Legs  for  this  Purpose ;  and %0a%3c many  Times  there  is  no  end  until  they  kill  one  another.  But %0a%3c if  one  of  them  obtains  the  Palm,  immediately  he  croweth  for %0a%3c his  Victory,  and  makes  it  known  that  he  is  truly  the  Chief. %0a%3c He  that  is  beaten  hideth  himself  in  Silence  ;  but  beareth  his %0a%3c Bondage  with  Reluctance.  And  the  very  common  Sort,  also, %0a%3c are  as  proud ;  marching  with  their  Neck  stretched  upright, %0a%3c and  the  Comb  lifted  aloft.  And  there  is  not  a  Bird  besides %0a%3c that  so  often  looketh  at  the  Sky,  at  the  same  Time  erecting %0a%3c his  arched  Tail ;  and  therefore  it  is,  that  they  are  a  terror  to %0a%3c Lions,  which  of  all  wild  Beasts  are  the  most  courageous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now  of  these  Cocks,  some  are  bred  for  nothing  but  Wars %0a%3c and  constant  Battles  ;  and  these  Cocks  have  rendered  illus- %0a%3c trious the  Countries  from  whence  they  come,  as  Ilhodus  and %0a%3c Tenagra ;  in  a  second  Place  of  Honour  are  esteemed  those  of %0a%3c Melos  and  Chalcis ;  so  that  to  those  Birds,  for  their  Worth, %0a%3c the  Roman  Purple  affords  much  Honour.  These  are  they %0a%3c from  which- the  Tripudium  solistimum1  is  observed.  These  rule %0a%3c our  Magistracy  every  Day ;  and  they  open  or  shut  their %0a%3c Houses  to  them ;  they  urge  forward  or  hold  back  the %0a%3c Roman  Rods ;  they  order  or  forbid  the  Battle,  and  were  the %0a%3c Auspices  of  all  our  Victories  throughout  the  World  ;  and, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  A  kind  of  omen  derived  from  the  manner  of  their  eating.

As  the  cock  was  peculiarly  an  emblem  of  watchful- %0a%3c ness, the  augury  derived  from  him  was  of  particular  importance  in  the %0a%3c army;  and  cocks  continued  to  be  carried  with  armies  in  comparatively %0a%3c modern  times,  professedly  to  proclaim  the  hours  by  their  crowing,  but %0a%3c certainly  through  the  lingering  remains  of  ancient  custom.  â€”  Wer?i.

If  they  are  castrated %0a%3c they  cease  to  crow.  And  this  Operation  is  practised  upon %0a%3c them  in  two  Ways  :  either  by  burning  their  Loins  with  a  hot %0a%3c Iron,  or  by  cauterising  their  Thighs  beneath,  and  then  pre- %0a%3c sently applying  to  the  Ulcer  Potter's  Chalk  ;  and  thus  they %0a%3c will  sooner  grow  fat.

And  if  a  Man  consider  from  how %0a%3c far  they  come,  from  the  Levant  Sea,  it  is  an  immense  Extent. %0a%3c When  they  set  forward  it  is  by  general  Consent.  They  fly  high, %0a%3c to  have  a  good  look  out ;  and  they  choose  a  Leader,  whom %0a%3c they  follow.  In  the  extremity  of  their  Host  there  are  some %0a%3c disposed  which  utter  Cries,  and  keep  the  Flock  in  orderly %0a%3c Arrangement  with  their  Voice ;  and  this  they  do  by  turns. %0a%3c They  maintain  a  Watch  all  the  Night  long,  and  the  Sentinels %0a%3c hold  a  little  Stone*  in  their  Foot,  which  by  falling  from  it,  if %0a%3c they  sleep,  reproves  them  for  their  Negligence.  All  the  rest %0a%3c sleep,  couching  their  Heads  under  their  Wings;  and  they %0a%3c stand  sometimes  upon  one  Foot,  and  sometimes  on  the  other. %0a%3c The  Leader  beareth  his  Neck  aloft  in  the  Air  as  he  looks %0a%3c forward,  and  giveth  his  Word  what  is  to  be  done.

It  is  certain %0a%3c that  when  they  are  about  to  take  flight  over  the  Pontus, %0a%3c they  will  fly  first  of  all  to  the  Straits  between  the  two %0a%3c Capes,  Criu-Metophon  and  Caranibis,  and  then  presently %0a%3c they  steady  themselves  with  Ballast.  When  they  have %0a%3c passed  the  middle  they  fling  away  the  Stones  from  their %0a%3c Feet;  and  when  they  are  come  to  the  Continent  they  dis- %0a%3c gorge the  Sand  from  their  Throat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cornelius  Nepos,  who  died  when  Divus  Augustus  was %0a%3c Sovereign,  where  he  wrote,  That  a  little  before  his  Time %0a%3c Men  began  to  fatten  the  captured  Thrushes,  adds,  That %0a%3c Storks  were  held  for  a  better  Dish  than  Cranes.  But  now, %0a%3c no  Man  will  touch  (a  Stork) ;  while  the  Crane  is  sought  after %0a%3c among  the  principal  Delicacies.  From  whence  these  Storks %0a%3c should  come,  or  whither  they  return,  is  not  yet  known.  No %0a%3c doubt  they  come  from  remote  Countries,  and  in  the  same %0a%3c manner  as  the  Cranes ;  only  that  the  Cranes  are  our  Guests %0a%3c in  Winter,  and  the  Storks  in  Summer.  When  they  are %0a%3c about  to  depart  they  assemble  in  a  Place  appointed,  and %0a%3c they  form  such  a  Company  that  not  one  of  the  Kind  is  left, %0a%3c unless  it  be  some  one  that  is  not  at  Liberty.  They  take  their %0a%3c Departure  on  the  given  Day,  as  if  by  an  established  Law. %0a%3c Although  it  appeared  that  they  were  about  to  remove,  yet %0a%3c no  Man  hath  seen  the  Flock  as  it  went ;  neither  do  we  see %0a%3c them  come,  but  we  know  that  they  are  come,  and  they  do %0a%3c the  one  and  the  other  always  by  Night.  And  although  they %0a%3c fly  away  and  return,  yet  they  are  supposed  never  to  have %0a%3c arrived  anywhere  but  in  the  Night.  There  is  a  Place  in  the %0a%3c open  Plains  of  Asia,  called  Pithonos-Come,  where  they %0a%3c assemble,  and  make  a  murmuring  Noise  among  themselves, %0a%3c and  tear  in  Pieces  that  one  which  was  the  last  to  arrive;  and %0a%3c then  they  depart.  It  hath  been  noted,  that  after  the  Ides  of %0a%3c August  they  are  not  easily  seen  there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some  affirm  that  Storks  have  no  Tongues.  So  highly %0a%3c are  they  respected  for  destroying  Serpents,  that  in  Thessaly %0a%3c it  was  a  capital  Crime  to  kill  a  Stork,  and  by  Law  he  is %0a%3c punished  the  same  as  for  slaying  a  Man. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.  in.  p %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 210  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  X . %0a%3c %0a%3c After  the  same  manner  Geese  and  Swans  associate  toge- %0a%3c ther ;  but  they  are  seen  in  their  Flight.  They  make  Way %0a%3c forcibly  after  the  Manner  of  the  Beaks  of  Ships,  for  by  this %0a%3c Means  they  more  easily  divide  the  Air  than  if  they  drove  it %0a%3c before  them  with  a  straight  Front.  The  Flock  is  spread  out %0a%3c by  Degrees,  expanding  itself  like  a  Wedge  behind,  and  so %0a%3c affords  a  great  Space  to  the  Wind,  which  impels  them.  They %0a%3c rest  their  Necks  upon  those  that  are  before  them,  and  as  the %0a%3c Leaders  become  weary  they  retire  behind.  Storks  seek  the %0a%3c same  Nest,  and  they  support  their  aged  Parents  in  return  for %0a%3c their  Kindness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some  say  there  is  lamentable  singing  at  the  Death  of %0a%3c Swans,  but  untruly,  as  I  suppose  ;  for,  from  some  Experience, %0a%3c these  Birds  devour  one  another's  Flesh  among  themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  this  Discourse  of  those  Fowls  that  make  Voyages  in %0a%3c Flocks  over  Seas  and  Lands  will  not  allow  me  to  put  off %0a%3c speaking  of  lesser  Birds  also,  which  are  of  the  same  Nature; %0a%3c for  those  before-named  may  seem  to  be  induced  to  do  so  by %0a%3c the  size  and  strength  of  their  Bodies.  Quails,1  therefore, %0a%3c always  come  before  the  Cranes.  It  is  a  little  Bird,  and  when %0a%3c it  comes  to  us,  it  belongs  to  the  Ground  rather  than  the  Air. %0a%3c The  Manner  of  their  flying  is  like  the  former ;  not  without %0a%3c some  Danger  of  the  Sailors  when  they  approach  near  to %0a%3c Land.  Because  they  often  settle  upon  their  Sails,  which  they %0a%3c do  always  in  the  Night,  and  sink  Vessels.  Their  Journey  is %0a%3c through  established  Resting-places.  In  the  Southwind  they %0a%3c do  not  fly;  because  it  is  wet  and  heavy.  And  yet  they %0a%3c choose  to  be  conveyed  by  the  Wind,  on  Account  of  the %0a%3c Weight  of  their  Bodies  arid  their  feeble  Strength.  Hence  as %0a%3c they  fly  their  complaining  expresses  their  Effort.  Com- %0a%3c monly, therefore,  they  fly  with  a  North  Wind,  the  Ortygo- %0a%3c metra  being  the  Leader.

It  is  judged  with  some  probability  that  not %0a%3c this  species,  but  the  Katta  (Tetrao  alchala,  LINN.)  is  the  bird  referred  to, %0a%3c under  the  name  of  Quail,  in  the  Books  of  Moses,  and  by  David,  Ps.

Whenever  they  are  upon %0a%3c their  Departure  hence  they  solicit  other  Birds  to  accompany %0a%3c them,  and  by  their  Inducements  there  go  with  them  the %0a%3c Glottis,1  Otis,2  and  Cychramus.3  The  Glottis  putteth  forth  a %0a%3c long  Tongue ;  from  which  it  hath  its  Name.  This  Bird  is %0a%3c very  forward  at  the  first  setting  out  on  the  pleasant  Journey; %0a%3c but  it  findeth  Repentance  in  the  Pain  of  the  Flight.  To  go %0a%3c back  again  without  Company  it  is  ashamed ;  and  so  to  lag %0a%3c behind  ;  neither  does  it  ever  persevere  for  more  than  one %0a%3c Day;  for  at  the  next  Resting-place  it  deserteth  the  Com- %0a%3c pany ;  but  it  meeteth  with  others  which  the  Year  before  were %0a%3c left  behind  :  and  thus  they  do  from  Time  to  Time.  The %0a%3c Cychramus  is  of  a  more  persevering  Nature,  and  maketh %0a%3c Haste  to  reach  those  Parts  which  it  so  much  desireth :  and %0a%3c therefore  in  the  Night  it  rouses  them,  and  puts  them  in %0a%3c mind  of  the  Journey.  The  Otis  is  less  than  the  Bubo,  and %0a%3c larger  than  the  Noctua,  having  two  Ears,  formed  of  Fea- %0a%3c thers standing  aloft ;  from  which  it  took  its  Name.  But  in %0a%3c Latin  some  have  called  it  Asio.  This  Bird,  besides,  is  skilful %0a%3c in  Imitation,  like  a  Parasite;  and,  in  a  particular  Way,  a %0a%3c Dancer.  It  is  easily  taken  as  the  Noctua,  while  it  looks %0a%3c intently  on  any  one,  by  another  that  goes  round  it.  But  if  a %0a%3c contrary  Wind  should  begin  to  hinder  the  Flight  of  the %0a%3c Troop,  they  render  their  Progress  steady  by  grasping  small %0a%3c weighty  Stones,  or  stuffing  their  Throat  with  Sand.  The %0a%3c Seed  of  the  Veratrum  is  a  grateful  Food  to  Quails;  for %0a%3c which  Reason  they  are  banished  from  Table.  At  the  same %0a%3c Time  they  are  accustomed  to  slaver  at  the  Mouth,  by  Reason %0a%3c of  the  comitial  Disease;4  which  they  only  are  the  Creatures, %0a%3c except  Man,  that  are  subject  to. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Totanus  glottis,  Cuv.

It  is  said  they  never  build  under  any %0a%3c Roof  in  Thebes,  because  that  City  had  often  been  taken ; %0a%3c nor  at  Bizia  in  Thrace,  on  Account  of  the  Wickedness  of %0a%3c Tereus.

Also  Fabius  Pictor %0a%3c reporteth  in  his  Annals,  that  when  a  Roman  Garrison  was %0a%3c besieged  by  the  Ligustini,  a  Swallow  was  taken  from  her %0a%3c little  ones  and  brought  to  him,  that  by  the  Number  of  Knots %0a%3c in  a  Thread  tied  to  her  Foot  he  should  signify  to  them  on %0a%3c what  Day  they  ought  to  make  a  Sally  to  meet  the  coming %0a%3c Help. %0a%3c %0a%3c Merulae,2  Turdi,  and  Sturni,  after  the  same  manner,  quit %0a%3c us  for  the  neighbouring  Places.

Then  the  Tone  is %0a%3c given  out,  modulated  according  to  the  one  perfect  Science  of %0a%3c Music;  for  a  while  in  one  entire  Breath  she  draweth  out  her %0a%3c Tune  at  length;  now  it  is  varied  in  Inflections;  sometimes  it %0a%3c is  distinguished  by  Stops ;  it  is  united  by  entwining,  it  is %0a%3c extended  in  being  drawn  back ;  on  a  sudden  it  is  drowned  : %0a%3c now  and  then  she  records  to  herself  full,  grave,  sharp,  short, %0a%3c drawn  out  where  she  sees  fit;  vibrating,  high,  middle,  low. %0a%3c In  short,  there  is  not  any  manufacture  of  a  Pipe  so  exqui- %0a%3c sitely contrived  by  the  Art  of  Man  that  can  accomplish  such %0a%3c a  Variety  of  Things  as  proceed  out  of  that  little  Throat  of %0a%3c hers.  So  that  no  doubt  this  Sweetness  was  foreshown  by  a %0a%3c powerful  Presage,  when  it  sang  in  the  Mouth  of  the  Infant %0a%3c Stesichorus.1  And  that  no  Man  may  doubt  that  it  is  the %0a%3c Effect  of  Art,  there  is  not  one  Nightingale  but  hath  many %0a%3c Tunes,  and  each  one  his  own  peculiar  one.  They  strive  who %0a%3c can  do  best ;  and  it  is  evident  that  they  contend  with  all %0a%3c their  Heart ;  for  often  she  that  is  conquered  ends  her  Life  in %0a%3c the  Contest,  and  yieldeth  up  her  Breath  sooner  than  her %0a%3c Song.  The  young  Nightingales  study  the  others,  and  under- %0a%3c stand the  Lessons  which  they  imitate.  The  Scholar  listens %0a%3c with  close  Attention,  and  rehearseth  what  she  hath  heard ; %0a%3c and  both  of  them  repeat  it  over  by  turns.  The  Correction  of %0a%3c what  is  amended  is  understood  ;  and  also  something  of  Re- %0a%3c proof in  the  Teacher.  Therefore  one  of  these  Nightingales %0a%3c obtains  the  Price  of  a  Slave;  yea,  indeed,  more  than  might %0a%3c in  old  Time  have  bought  an  Armour-bearer.

And  now  of  late  we  have  seen  many  of  them %0a%3c begin  to  sing  at  command ;  and  to  take  their  turn  in  Sym- %0a%3c phony.

Soon  after,  when  the  Weather %0a%3c groweth  hotter,  their  Voice  is  entirely  altered  ;  being  neither %0a%3c musical  nor  various.

They  breed  in  Mid-winter,  and  the  Days %0a%3c when  this  is  are  called  the  Halcyon  Days :  for  while  they %0a%3c last,  the^Sea  is  calm  and  navigable,  especially  in  Sicily.

The  Hirundines %0a%3c frame  their  Nests  of  Clay,  but  they  strengthen  them  with %0a%3c Straw.  If  at  any  Time  there  is  a  scarcity  of  Clay,  they  wet %0a%3c their  Feathers  with  a  quantity  of  Water,  and  sprinkle  the %0a%3c Dust  with  it.  They  line  the  Nest  itself  with  soft  Feathers %0a%3c or  fine  Flox,  to  keep  the  Eggs  warm,  and  also  that  it  may %0a%3c not  be  hard  to  the  young  Birds.  They  distribute  the  Food %0a%3c by  turns  to  the  Young  with  strict  Equality.  They  remove %0a%3c the  Excrement  of  the  young  ones  with  remarkable  Attention %0a%3c to  Cleanness ;  but  when  they  are  grown  something  more, %0a%3c they  teach  them  to  turn  about,  and  discharge  their  Fulness %0a%3c beyond  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  is  another  kind  of  Hirundo,  that  keeps  in  the %0a%3c country  Villages  and  Fields,  which  seldom  build  their  Nests %0a%3c in  Houses ;  but  their  Nests  are  formed  of  the  same  Material %0a%3c as  the  former,  although  of  a  different  Shape,  supine,  with  the %0a%3c Entrance  thrust  forward  straight  and  narrow ;  but  "the  Capa- %0a%3c city within  is  large ;  so  that  it  is  wonderful  how  skilful  and %0a%3c capable  they  are  in  concealing  their  young  ones,  and  in %0a%3c lining  it  with  soft  Materials.  In  the  Heracleotic  Mouth  of %0a%3c Egypt,  there  is  a  mighty  Bank  raised  by  a  continual  Course %0a%3c of  Nests  for  the  length  almost  of  one  Stadium  (half-a-quarter %0a%3c of  a  Mile) ;  which  is  impregnable  against  the  spreading %0a%3c abroad  of  the  Nile :  a  piece  of  Work  which  could  not  have %0a%3c been  accomplished  by  human  Labour.  In  the  same  Egypt, %0a%3c near  the  Town  Coptos,  there  is  an  Island  sacred  to  Isis, %0a%3c which,  that  the  same  River  may  not  tear  to  Pieces,  these %0a%3c Swallows  fortify  by  their  Labour :  in  the  beginning  of  the %0a%3c Spring,  for  three  Days  and  Nights,  employing  their  Bill  to %0a%3c make  it  strong  with  Straw  and  Chaff;  and  they  continue %0a%3c their  Work  by  Night  with  so  much  Labour,  that  it  is %0a%3c known  many  of  them  have  died  with  the  Labour.  This %0a%3c public  Work  always  recurs  to  them  with  the  return  of  the %0a%3c Year. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  is  a  third  sort  of  these  Swallows,  which  dig  Hol- %0a%3c lows in  the  Banks,  and  so  form  Nests  within.  The  young %0a%3c Birds  of  these,  if  burnt  to  Ashes,  are  a  Remedy  for  the %0a%3c deadly  Quinsey,  and  many  other  Diseases  of  the  human %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 222  History  of  Nature.

These  do  not  build  Nests ;  but  if  they  perceive  that %0a%3c the  River  is  going  to  increase,  and  will  rise  as  high  as  their %0a%3c Holes,  they  go  away  many  Days  before. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  are  Birds  of  the  kind  of  Parrse,1  which  with  dry %0a%3c Moss  make  a  Nest,  resembling  so  perfectly  a  round  Bali %0a%3c that  the  Entrance  cannot  be  discovered.  Another,  called %0a%3c Argatilis,2  makes  her  Nest  of  the  same  form,  but  it  is  woven %0a%3c of  Flax. %0a%3c %0a%3c A  kind  of  Picus3  maketh  a  Nest  in  the  manner  of  a  Gob- %0a%3c let, and  hangeth  it  at  a  Twig,  on  the  uppermost  Branches, %0a%3c that  no  Quadruped  may  be  able  to  reach  it.  It  is  established %0a%3c that  Galguli  (Orioles)  take  their  Sleep  hanging  by  their %0a%3c Legs,  hoping  by  that  means  to  be  in  more  Safety.  It  is,  in- %0a%3c deed, commonly  known,  that  all  these  Birds,  with  good %0a%3c Providence,  choose  some  cross  Boughs  for  Rafters,  to  sup- %0a%3c port their  Nests ;  and  then  cover  them  from  the  Rain  with %0a%3c an  arched  Roof,  or  else  enclose  them  among  the  thick %0a%3c Leaves. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  Arabia  there  is  a  Bird  called  Cinnamologos,4  which %0a%3c builds  her  Nest  with  Twigs  of  the  Cinnamon-tree.  The %0a%3c Inhabitants  of  that  Country  shake  them  down  with  Arrows %0a%3c headed  with  Lead,  for  the  sake  of  Profit.  In  Scythia,  there %0a%3c is  a  Bird  of  the  bigness  of  an  Otis,  which  layeth  two  Eggs; %0a%3c and  she  always  wraps  them  in  a  Hare's  Skin  ;  and  hangeth %0a%3c them  upon  the  top  Branches  of  Trees.  The  Picae,  when %0a%3c they  perceive  with  their  watching  Eye  that  a  Man  hath  dis- %0a%3c covered their  Nest,  presently  remove  their  Eggs  to  another. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  this  place  Gaza  reads,  Ripariarum ;  that  is,  of  bank  birds ;  and %0a%3c Gesner,  Parorum,  or  Tomtits ;  Gelenius  reads  Perrarum.

One  is  called  Merops,1  that  useth  to %0a%3c feed  her  Parents  as  they  lie  hid.  The  inside  of  her  Feathers %0a%3c in  the  Wing  is  pale,  the  outside  blue ;  and  those  above  about %0a%3c the  Neck,  reddish.  She  maketh  her  Nest  in  a  Hole  six  Feet %0a%3c deep  within  the  Ground.  Partridges  so  fortify  their  Place  of %0a%3c deposit  with  Thorns  and  Twigs,  that  they  are  sufficiently %0a%3c fenced  against  wild  Beasts.  They  heap  up  over  their  Eggs  a %0a%3c covering  of  fine  Dust;  neither  do  they  sit  in  the  Place  where %0a%3c they  laid  them  first,  but  lest  their  more  frequent  resort  to  it %0a%3c should  lead  to  Suspicion,  they  convey  them  to  some  other %0a%3c Place.  And,  indeed,  the  Hens  deceive  also  the  Males ;  for  so %0a%3c lecherous  are  they,  that  they  break  their  Eggs,  because  they %0a%3c may  not  be  occupied  about  sitting.  Then  through  desire %0a%3c after  the  Hens,  the  Males  fight  among  themselves ;  and  they %0a%3c say  that  the  one  which  is  overcome,  suffereth  Venus.  Trogus %0a%3c reporteth  the  same  of  Quails,  and  sometimes  of  Dunghill %0a%3c Cocks.  He  saith,  also,  that  tame  Partridges  use  to  tread %0a%3c the  wild ;  and  those  which  are  new  taken  or  conquered  by %0a%3c others  promiscuously.  This  libidinous  Heat  maketh  them %0a%3c so  quarrelsome,  that  oftentimes  it  leads  to  their  being  taken. %0a%3c For  when  the  Fowler  cometh  with  his  Call,  out  goeth  the %0a%3c Leader  of  the  whole  Flock  to  fight  him ;  and  when  he  is %0a%3c caught,  another  followeth  after,  and  so  the  rest  one  after %0a%3c another.  Again,  they  take  the  Females  at  the  Time  of  the %0a%3c Copulation ;  for  then  forth  they  go  against  the  female %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Merops  apiaster,  LINN. â€” Bee-eater.  ^Elian  says,  that  the  young  of %0a%3c this  bird  exceeds  in  piety  the  young  of  the  Stork  in  the  care  with  which %0a%3c they  feed  their  parents  when  worn  out  with  age ;  which  Cuvier  explains %0a%3c from  their  remaining  a  long  time  in  the  same  retreats  with  them. â€” %0a%3c Wern.

If  the  Hens  stand  over-against  the %0a%3c Cocks,  the  Air  that  passeth  from  them  causes  them  to  con- %0a%3c ceive. For  so  hot  are  they  in  that  Season,  that  they  gape %0a%3c and  hang  out  the  Tongue.  And  if  the  Males  fly  over  them, %0a%3c with  the  Breath  that  cometh  from  them  they  conceive :  and %0a%3c many  Times  if  they  do  but  hear  their  call.  And  so  effec- %0a%3c tually does  their  Lechery  overcome  their  Affection  to  their %0a%3c Young,  that  while  they  are  incubating  in  some  secret  Place, %0a%3c if  they  hear  the  Fowler's  (Decoy)  Female  coming  towards %0a%3c the  Male,  she  returns  the  Song,  and  calls  back  the  Males, %0a%3c and  offers  herself  to  his  Pleasure.  Indeed  they  are  borne %0a%3c away  with  such  Rage,  that,  as  if  blind  with  the  Trepidation, %0a%3c they  will  settle  upon  the  Head  of  the  Fowler.  If  he  begins %0a%3c to  approach  the  Nest  of  the  breeding  Hen,  she  will  run  forth %0a%3c to  his  Feet,  counterfeiting  that  she  is  very  heavy  and  feeble; %0a%3c and  either  in  her  running,  or  some  short  flight,  she  will  sud- %0a%3c denly fall,  as  if  she  had  broken  a  Wing  or  her  Leg :  then %0a%3c will  she  run  again,  and  when  he  is  just  ready  to  take  her  up, %0a%3c yet  will  she  shift  away,  and  so  disappoint  his  Hope,  until  she %0a%3c hath  led  him  a  contrary  Way  from  the  Young.  When  she  is %0a%3c free  from  Fear,  and  void  of  motherly  Care,  then  will  she  get %0a%3c into  a  Furrow  of  the  Ground,  lie  on  her  Back,  catch  a  Clot %0a%3c of  Earth  with  her  Feet,  and  with  it  hide  herself.

The  Females  endure  their  imperious  Males,  and %0a%3c even  those  which  are  churlish ;  because  they  are  jealous, %0a%3c though  their  Nature  is  not  that  Way.  Then  the  Throat  is %0a%3c full  of  Complaint,  and  they  peck  them  cruelly  with  their %0a%3c Beaks;  and  yet  soon  after,  by  way  of  Satisfaction,  they  kiss %0a%3c them,  and  will  make  court  to  them,  by  turning  round  about %0a%3c many  Times  with  their  Feet,  and  utter  the  Prayers  of  Venus. %0a%3c The  Male  and  the  Female  love  their  Young  alike :  and %0a%3c often  there  is  Correction,  because  the  Hen  does  not  more %0a%3c frequently  visit  her  Young.  When  they  are  about  to  lay, %0a%3c they  comfort  and  minister  to  them.  So  soon  as  the  Eggs %0a%3c are  hatched  they  discharge  into  the  Mouths  of  the  Young  a %0a%3c salt  kind  of  Earth,  which  they  have  gathered  in  their  Throat, %0a%3c to  prepare  their  Stomachs  in  Time  for  Food.  Doves  and %0a%3c Turtle-doves  have  this  Property,  that  when  they  drink  they %0a%3c do  not  draw  their  Necks  back,  but  take  a  large  Draught  in %0a%3c the  manner  of  Cattle. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXV. %0a%3c Of  the  Palumbus. %0a%3c %0a%3c WE  have  some  Authors  who  affirm  that  the  Palumbus %0a%3c lives  thirty  Years,  and  some  to  forty  Years,  with  no  Incon- %0a%3c venience but  this :  that  their  Claws  become  overgrown, %0a%3c which  is  a  Sign  of  old  Age  ;  but  they  may  be  pared  without %0a%3c Danger.  They  have  all  one  and  the  same  manner  of  Tune; %0a%3c they  make  three  Rests  in  their  Song,  besides  the  close,  which %0a%3c is  a  Moan.  In  Winter  they  are  silent;  in  Spring  they  are %0a%3c loud.

The  Cock  Sparrow  is  reported %0a%3c to  live  but  one  Year ;  the  Proof  is,  because  in  the  Beginning %0a%3c of  Spring  not  one  of  them  is  found  with  a  black  Bill,  which %0a%3c begins  from  the  Summer.  The  Hens  live  somewhat  longer. %0a%3c But  to  come  again  to  Doves,  it  is  true  that  they  have  a  cer- %0a%3c tain Understanding  of  Glory ;  and  you  would  think  that %0a%3c they  have  a  Knowledge  of  their  Colours,  and  their  change- %0a%3c able Disposition.  Moreover,  they  seem  to  take  a  Pride  in %0a%3c flying  in  the  Air,  and  cutting  the  Air  every  way.  In  which %0a%3c Display,  while  they  flap  with  their  Wings  with  much  Noise %0a%3c (which  cannot  be  without  the  dashing  of  the  Feathers %0a%3c of  their  Wings  against  their  Shoulders),  they  are  exposed  to %0a%3c the  Hawks  as  if  they  were  bound ;  for  otherwise,  if  the %0a%3c Flight  were  free,  they  were  much  more  swift  of  Wing.

And  in  Truth,  these  Birds  have  the  Art %0a%3c to  flatter  and  entice  one  another ;  and  thus  they  return  to %0a%3c their  Homes  the  better  accompanied  on  Account  of  their %0a%3c Roguery.  Doves  also  have  served  for  Messengers  in  great %0a%3c Affairs  :  as  at  the  Siege  of  Mutina,  Decimus  Brutus  sent  out %0a%3c of  the  Town  Letters  tied  to  their  Feet,  to  the  Camp  of  the %0a%3c Consuls.  What  good,  then,  did  the  Rampart  and  Watch  in %0a%3c the  Siege,  and  the  Nets  stretched  across  the  River,  to %0a%3c Antony,  when  the  Messenger  was  able  to  pass  through  the %0a%3c Air?  Many  Men  are  gone  mad  in  their  Love  to  these  Birds: %0a%3c they  build  Towers  above  the  tops  of  their  Houses  for  them ; %0a%3c and  they  reckon  up  their  Origin  and  Nobility,  as  in  one  old %0a%3c Example.  L.  Axius,  a  Roman  Knight,  before  the  Civil  War %0a%3c with  Pompey,  sold  every  pair  (of  Pigeons)  for  four  hundred %0a%3c Denarii,1  as  M.  Varro*  reports.  Besides  this,  they  have %0a%3c rendered  their  Country  noble ;  for  Campania  is  supposed %0a%3c to  produce  by  far  the  greatest.  Their  manner  of  flying  leads %0a%3c me  to  the  Consideration  of  the  Flight  of  other  Fowls. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXVIII. %0a%3c Of  the  Pace  and  Flight  of  Birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL  other  living  Creatures  have  one  certain  and  uniform %0a%3c manner  of  going,  each  according  to  its  kind.  Birds  only %0a%3c vary  their  Course,  whether  they  go  upon  the  Ground  or  fly %0a%3c in  the  Air.

The %0a%3c Romans  had  their  favourite  varieties,  for  which  they  paid  enormous %0a%3c prices :  varying  from  one  or  two  to  twelve  or  fourteen  pounds  a  couple. %0a%3c â€”  Wern.

The  Vulture, %0a%3c and  for  the  most  part  all  heavy  Birds,  cannot  take  flight, %0a%3c unless  they  fetch  a  Run,  or  else  rise  from  some  high  Heap. %0a%3c And  such  are  directed  in  the  Air  by  their  Tails.  Some  look %0a%3c about,  others  bend  their  Necks  ;  some  feed  on  the  Prey %0a%3c which  they  have  snatched  away  in  their  Talons.  Most  Birds %0a%3c utter  their  Voice  as  they  fly ;  yet  some,  on  the  contrary,  in %0a%3c their  Flight  are  always  silent.  Some  fly  half  upright ;  others %0a%3c tending  downward  :  some  fly  obliquely ;  to  the  Sides,  to  the %0a%3c Bills :  and  some  are  bent  backward,  so  that  if  many  Sorts %0a%3c could  be  seen  together,  they  would  appear  to  pass  along  as %0a%3c if  they  were  of  a  very  different  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXIX. %0a%3c OftheApu*.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Birds  which  they  call  Apodes  (because  they  are %0a%3c without  the  use  of  the  Feet),  and  others,  Cypseli,  are  very %0a%3c strong  on  the  Wing.

This  Bird %0a%3c cometh  from  India,  where  they  call  it  Sittace.  It  is  green  all %0a%3c over  the  Body,  only  it  hath  a  distinct  Collar  about  the  Neck %0a%3c of  vermilion  red.  The  Parrot  salutes  Emperors,  and  pro- %0a%3c nounces what  Words  she  heareth ;  she  is  also  very  wanton %0a%3c under  the  Influence  of  Wine.  Her  Head  is  as  hard  as  her %0a%3c Beak.  When  she  learns  to  speak,  she  must  be  beaten  about %0a%3c the  Head  with  a  Rod  of  Iron  :  for  otherwise  she  careth  for %0a%3c no  Blows.  When  she  taketh  her  Flight  downward,  she %0a%3c alighteth  upon  her  Bill,  and  leans  upon  it,  and  by  that %0a%3c means  favoureth  her  Feet,  which  are  but  feeble. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  is  a  kind  of  Pica  (Magpie)  of  less  excellency,  be- %0a%3c cause she  does  not  come  from  so  far ;  but  she  pronounceth %0a%3c what  is  taught  her  more  freely  and  distinctly.  These  take  a %0a%3c Love  to  the  Words  they  speak ;  for  they  not  only  learn %0a%3c them,  but  they  delight  in  them :  insomuch  that  they  study %0a%3c them  inwardly,  and  by  their  careful  thinking  upon  what %0a%3c they  learn,  they  show  how  attentive  they  are.  It  is  known %0a%3c that  they  have  died  for  Grief  that  they  could  not  conquer %0a%3c the  Difficulty  of  some  Words ;  as  also,  that  unless  they  hear %0a%3c the  same  Words  repeated  often,  their  Memory  fails  to  retain %0a%3c them.  If  they  are  in  search  of  a  Word,  and  chance  te  hear %0a%3c it  pronounced,  they  will  show  wonderful  Signs  of  Joy.  Their %0a%3c Beauty  is  not  ordinary,  although  not  very  lovely.  But  they %0a%3c are  handsome  enough  in  the  Power  to  imitate  human  Speech. %0a%3c It  is  said,  that  none  of  their  kind  are  able  to  learn,  except %0a%3c such  only  as  feed  upon  Mast;  and  among  them,  those  acquire %0a%3c the  more  easily  that  have  five  toes  to  their  Feet:  but  not %0a%3c even  these  unless  in  the  two  first  Years  of  their  Age.  Their %0a%3c Tongue  is  broader  than  ordinary :  as  they  are  all  in  every %0a%3c separate  kind  that  counterfeit  Man's  Voice :  although  this %0a%3c happens  to  almost  all  Birds.  Agrippina,  the  Wife  of  Clau- %0a%3c dius Caesar ,  had  a  Turdus  (Thrush)  at  the  Time  I  compiled %0a%3c this  Book,  which  imitated  Man's  Speech ;  a  Thing  never %0a%3c known  before.

Moreover,  they  would  study  their  Lessons  all  Day, %0a%3c and  continually  come  out  with  new  Words  formed  into  a  long %0a%3c Speech.  To  teach  them,  these  Birds  must  be  in  a  Place %0a%3c apart,  where  they  can  hear  no  other  Voice  to  mingle  with %0a%3c what  they  learn ;  and  one  is  to  sit  by  them,  who  must  repeat %0a%3c often  what  he  would  have  them  fix  in  their  Memory,  and %0a%3c please  them  also  with  giving  them  Meat. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIII. %0a%3c The  Understanding  of  Ravens  (Conn). %0a%3c %0a%3c LET  us  not  defraud  the  Ravens  also  of  their  due  Praise, %0a%3c as  witnessed  not  only  by  the  Knowledge  but  the  Indignation %0a%3c of  the  People  of  Rome.  When  Tiberius  was  Prince,  there %0a%3c was  a  young  Raven  hatched  in  a  Nest  upon  the  Temple  of %0a%3c Castor  (and  Pollux),  which  took  his  Flight  into  a  Shoe- %0a%3c maker's Shop  overagaiiist  the  Temple,  and  thus  was  com- %0a%3c mended to  the  Master  of  the  Shop  by  the  Obligation  of %0a%3c Religion.  This  Raven  in  Time  became  accustomed  to  Man's %0a%3c Speech,  and  every  Morning  would  fly  to  the  Rostra,  and %0a%3c turning  to  the  Forum,  he  would  salute  Tiberius,  and  after %0a%3c him  Germanicus  and  Drusus,  the  Ccesars,  by  their  Names ; %0a%3c and  presently  the  People  of  Rome  that  passed  by.  And %0a%3c when  he  had  so  done,  he  would  fly  again  to  the  Warehouse. %0a%3c This  Practice  he  continued  for  several  Years  together,  to  the %0a%3c Wonder  of  all.  The  Master  of  the  nearest  Shoemaker's %0a%3c Shop,  either  through  Envy  of  his  Neighbour,  or  some  sudden %0a%3c fit  of  Anger  (as  he  wished  it  to  appear)  because  the  Raven %0a%3c had  made  a  Spot  upon  a  Pair  of  his  Shoes  with  his  Dung, %0a%3c killed  the  Bird  ;  at  which  the  People  took  such  Indignation, %0a%3c that  they  first  drove  him  out  of  that  Neighbourhood,  and %0a%3c not  long  after  murdered  him  ;  and  the  Funeral  of  the  Raven %0a%3c was  solemnly  performed  with  all  the  ceremonial  Obsequies. %0a%3c For  the  Bier  was  formed  and  bedecked,  and  so  carried  upon %0a%3c the  Shoulders  of  two  Ethiopians,  with  a  Piper  going  before, %0a%3c with  Crowns  of  all  kinds,  as  far  as  to  the  funeral  Fire ; %0a%3c which  was  piled  at  the  right  Hand  of  the  Appian  Way,  at %0a%3c the  secoHd  Stone,  in  a  Field  called  Rediculi,  Thus  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  X.]  History  of  Nature.  233 %0a%3c %0a%3c People  of  Rome  regarded  the  ready  Wit  of  this  Bird  a  suffi- %0a%3c cient Cause  to  justify  a  sumptuous  Funeral,  and  also  to %0a%3c excuse  the  Murder  of  a  Citizen  of  Rome  in  that  City, %0a%3c wherein  many  Princes  have  died,  and  no  IV3an  solemnized %0a%3c their  Funerals :  one  Instance  of  which  is,  that  no  one %0a%3c avenged  the  Death  of  Scipio  JEmiUanus,  after  he  had  de- %0a%3c stroyed both  Carthage  and  Numantia.  This  happened  the %0a%3c fifth  Day  before  the  Calends  of  April,  in  the  Year  when %0a%3c M.  Svrvilius  and  C.  Cestius  were  Consuls.  Even  at  this %0a%3c Time,  when  I  am  writing,  there  is  in  the  City  of  Rome  a %0a%3c Crow  (Comix)  belonging  to  a  Roman  Knight,  who  brought %0a%3c it  from  Bsetica,  which  was  an  admirable  Bird  for  the %0a%3c exceeding  black  Colour  of  its  Feathers,  and  also  for  pro- %0a%3c nouncing many  Words  formed  into  a  Sentence  ;  and  it  learns %0a%3c more  and  more  every  Day.  It  is  not  long  since  that  there %0a%3c arose  a  Report  of  a  Man  in  Erizena,  a  Country  of  Asia, %0a%3c whose  Name  was  Craterus  Motioceros :  who  used  to  hunt  by %0a%3c the  Help  of  Ravens,  which  he  carried  with  him  into  the %0a%3c Woods,  perching  upon  his  Shoulders  and  his  Hunting- %0a%3c horns  :  and  these  would  seek  out  and  put  up  others,  and %0a%3c bring  them  to  him  in  their  Company  ;  so  that  when  he %0a%3c returned  homeward  out  of  the  Forest,  the  wild  ones  'also %0a%3c would  accompany  him.  Some  have  thought  it  worth  the %0a%3c setting  upon  Record,  that  a  Raven  was  seen,  when  she  was %0a%3c thirsty,  to  cast  Stones  into  the  Bucket  belonging  to  a %0a%3c Sepulchre,  in  which  there  was  some  Rain-water  remaining,* %0a%3c but  which  he  was  not  able  to  reach:  and  being  afraid  to  go %0a%3c down  into  it,  he  thrust  in  so  many  Stories  that  he  was  enabled %0a%3c to  drink  as  much  as  he  pleased. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIV. %0a%3c Of  the  Birds  of  Diomedes. %0a%3c %0a%3c NEITHER  will  I  pass  over  the  Birds  (called)  Diomedeae,1 %0a%3c which  Juba    nameth    Cataractae ;    and    he   says   they    have %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  appears  to  be  Lestris  cataractes,  Cuv. ;  Skua,  or  a  kindred %0a%3c species.  ^Elian  speaks  of  it  as  a  kind  of  Heron :  B.  i.  ch.  i.  â€”  Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 234  History  of  Nature.

They  have  always  two  Leaders,  one  to  lead  the  Host, %0a%3c and  the  other  to  guard  the  rear.  With  their  Bills  they  dig %0a%3c Furrows,  over  which  they  strew  Bundles  of  Sticks,  and  cover %0a%3c them  with  the  Earth  that  they  have  before  thrown  out ;  and %0a%3c in  these  Recesses  they  breed.  Every  one  of  these  Trenches %0a%3c hath  two  Doors :  one  looking  toward  the  East,  through %0a%3c which  they  go  out  to  feed  ;  and  the  other  looking  west- %0a%3c ward, by  which  they  return.  When  these  Birds  discharge %0a%3c themselves,  they  always  fly  against  the  Wind.  They  are %0a%3c found  only  in  one  Place  of  all  the  World,  which  is  an %0a%3c Island,  ennobled,  as  we  have  written  before,  for  the  Tomb %0a%3c and  Shrine  of  Diomedes,  opposite  the  Coast  of  Apulia.  These %0a%3c Birds  are  like  the  Fulicae.  They  annoy  Strangers  that  come %0a%3c thither  with  their  Cries  ;  but  they  fawn  upon  Greeks  only,  as %0a%3c if  they  give  such  friendly  Welcome  to  the  Race  of  Diomedes. %0a%3c Every  Day  they  fill  their  Throat  and  Wings  with  Water,  arid %0a%3c so  wash  and  purify  the  Temple;  and  hence  arose  the  Fable, %0a%3c that  the  Companions  of  Diomedes  were  turned  into  the %0a%3c Shapes  of  these  Birds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLV. %0a%3c What  Animals  cannot  learn  anything. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND  now  that  we  are  in  this  Discourse  on  Ingenuity,  I %0a%3c must  not  omit  to  note,  that  among  Birds,  the  Swallows %0a%3c (Hirundines),  and  of  land  Animals  the  Mouse  (Mures), %0a%3c are  very  untoward  in  being  brought  to  learn.

They  are %0a%3c bred  in  Egypt,  and  stand  upon  three  Toes.  Their  chief %0a%3c feeding  is  upon  Flies.  In  Italy  they  will  not  live  many %0a%3c Days.  All  the  heavier  Fowls  live  on  Fruits.  They  that  fly %0a%3c high  prey  only  upon  Flesh.  Among  Water-fowls  the  Mergi %0a%3c are  accustomed  to  devour  what  other  Birds  disgorge.  The %0a%3c Onocrotali3  much  resemble  Swans,  and  they  might  be %0a%3c thought  to  be  not  altogether  different,  but  that  they  have %0a%3c within  their  Throat  another  kind  of  Receptacle,  into  which %0a%3c these  insatiable  Fowls  gather  all  they  can  get,  so  wonderful %0a%3c is  its  Capacity.  Now  when  they  have  accomplished  their %0a%3c Ravening,  they  return  it  from  thence  by  little  and  little  into %0a%3c their  Mouth,  from  whence  it  is  conveyed  to  the  true  Belly, %0a%3c after  the  manner  of  a  ruminating  Creature.  These  Fowls  are %0a%3c sent  from  the  parts  of  Gallia  lying  nearest  the  North  Ocean. %0a%3c In  Hercinia,  a  thick  Forest  of  Germany,  we  have  heard  that %0a%3c there  are  unaccustomed  kinds  of  Birds,  with  Feathers  shin- %0a%3c ing like  Fire4  by  Night.

They  are  a  kind  of  Turdi,  somewhat  less  than  House- %0a%3c pigeons  (Columbse),  pleasant  to  eat.  The  Balearic  Islands %0a%3c send  us  another  Porphyrio,  better  than  that  before-named.1 %0a%3c There  also  the  Buzzard  (Buteo),  a  kind  of  Hawk,  is  held  as %0a%3c excellent  for  the  Table.  Likewise  the  Vipio,  for  so  they  call %0a%3c the  lesser  Crane.  As  for  the  Fowls  called  Pegasi,  with %0a%3c Heads  like  Horses';  and  the  Gryphae  (Griffins),  with  long %0a%3c Ears  and  a  hooked  Beak,  I  take  them  to  be  Fables  :  and  yet %0a%3c they  say  that  the  Pegasi  are  in  Scythia,  and  the  Gryphae %0a%3c (Griffins)  in  Ethiopia.  Moreover,  I  think  the  same  of  the %0a%3c Tragopanades,  which  many  affirm  to  be  greater  than  the %0a%3c Eagle,  having  crooked  Horns  on  each  side  of  the  Head,  of %0a%3c the  colour  of  Iron,  and  the  Head  only  purple.  Neither  do %0a%3c the  Syrens  obtain  Faith,  although  Dino,  the  Father  of %0a%3c Clitarthus  the  celebrated  Writer,  affirms  that  they  exist  in %0a%3c India:  and  that  with  their  Singing  they  will  lull  People  into %0a%3c deep  Sleep,  and  then  tear  them  in  Pieces.  He  that  will %0a%3c give  Credit  to  these  Things  will  not  deny  that  Dragons,  in %0a%3c Truth,  taught  Melampus,  by  licking  his  Ears,  to  understand %0a%3c the  Language  of  Birds;  or  the  Things  that  Democritas %0a%3c telleth,  who  nameth  the  Birds,  of  whose  Blood  mingled %0a%3c together  there  is  engendered  a  Serpent ;  which  whoever %0a%3c eateth  shall  know  what  Birds  say  one  to  another:  and  the %0a%3c Things  he  telleth  particularly  of  that  one  Bird,  the  Galerita : 2 %0a%3c although  without  these  there  is  an  immense  Collection  to %0a%3c %0a%3c O %0a%3c %0a%3c occupy  Life  about  Auguries.

And  therefore  it  is  better %0a%3c to  write  of  those  we  certainly  know. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  L. %0a%3c %0a%3c Who  first  invented  to  cram  Hens.     Of  Aviaries,  and  who  first %0a%3c invented  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Inhabitants  of  Delos  began  the  cramming  of  Hens. %0a%3c And  from  thence  arose  that  Plague  of  eating  the  Birds  so %0a%3c fat,  as  to  be  larded  with  their  own  Body.  Among  the  old %0a%3c Statutes  ordained  to  repress  inordinate  Suppers,  I  find  in %0a%3c one  Law  made  by  C.  Fannius,  the  Consul,  eleven  Years  be- %0a%3c fore the  third  Punic  War,  That  no  Man  should  place  (on  his %0a%3c Table)  more  than  one  Hen,  which  should  not  be  fattened  ; %0a%3c which  Head  or  Injunction  was  afterwards  taken  from  this %0a%3c and  inserted  in  all  the  other  Laws.  But  a  Bye-path  was %0a%3c found  out  to  deceive  the  Meaning,  by  feeding  the  Barn-door %0a%3c Fowls  also  with  a  Paste  soaked  in  Milk,  by  which  their %0a%3c Flesh  was  rendered  much  more  tender.  It  is  not  always %0a%3c that  Hens  only  are  selected  for  fattening ;  but  they  are  only %0a%3c thought  well  crammed  when  they  are  fat  in  the  Skin  about %0a%3c the  Neck.  Afterwards  the  Skill  of  the  Cooks  began  to  look %0a%3c to  their  Haunches  ;  and  that  they  may  be  divided  along  the %0a%3c Chine,  and  be  extended  from  one  Leg,  so  as  to  take  up  the %0a%3c whole  Sideboard.  The  Parthians  also  have  taught  our %0a%3c Cooks  their  Fashions.  And  yet  for  all  this  fine  dressing %0a%3c out  of  Meat,  there  is  nothing  that  wholly  pleaseth ;  for  one %0a%3c praises  nothing  but  the  Haunch,  and  in  another  Place  the %0a%3c Breast  only  is  commended.  The  first  that  invented  an %0a%3c Aviary  in  which  to  shut  up  all  kinds  of  Fowls,  was  M.  Lenius %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Scops  is  described  by  ^Elian  (B.  xv.  ch.  xxviii.)  as  a  very  small- %0a%3c eared  owl,  of  a  lead  colour,  with  white  spots.  The  ridiculous  gesticu- %0a%3c lations which  were  doubted  by  Pliny,  are  affirmed  by  ^Elian ;  who  says %0a%3c that  fowlers  imitated  them,  and  by  so  doing  attracted  its  attention,  and %0a%3c succeeded  in  catching  it.â€” -Wern.

And  by %0a%3c his  Example  we  began  to  confine  Animals  within  Prisons  ;^ %0a%3c to  which  Creatures  Nature  had  assigned  the  wide  Air. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LI. %0a%3c Of  jEsop's  Platter. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  in  this  Relation  the  most  distinguished  is  the %0a%3c Platter  of  Clodius  JEsopus,  the  Actor  of  Tragedies ;  which %0a%3c was  valued  at  six  hundred  Sestertia.1  In  this  he  served  up %0a%3c all  kind  of  Birds  remarkable  for  Song  or  capable  of  human %0a%3c Speech ;  and  they  cost  him  six  hundred  Sesterces  a-piece. %0a%3c And  it  was  no  Pleasure  that  guided  him  in  this,  beyond  the %0a%3c Fact  that  he  would  eat  the  Imitators  of  Man  :  without  any %0a%3c Consideration  that,  in  Truth,  all  his  own  rich  Revenues  had %0a%3c been  procured  by  his  Tongue  :  a  Father  verily  worthy  of  a %0a%3c Son  who,  as  we  said  before,  devoured  those  Pearls.2  And, %0a%3c to  speak  the  Truth,  it  is  hard  to  judge  which  of  the  two %0a%3c committed  the  greatest  Baseness ;  unless  that  it  is  less  to %0a%3c sup  on  the  greatest  Riches  of  Nature  than  on  Men's %0a%3c Tongues. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LII. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Generation  of  Birds ;  and  besides  Birds,  what  four- %0a%3c footed  Beasts  lay  Eggs. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Generation  of  Birds  seemeth  to  be  simple ;  and  yet %0a%3c therein  are  to  be  found  some  wonderful  Things.  For  four- %0a%3c footed  Animals  also  produce  Eggs ;  as  Chamaeleons,  Lizards, %0a%3c and  such  as  we  named  among  Serpents.  Of  Fowls,  those %0a%3c that  have  hooked  Claws  are  less  fertile,  and  among  these, %0a%3c only  the  Cenchris  layeth  above  four.

Their  Embrace  is  performed  two %0a%3c Ways:  for  either  the  Female  croucheth  to  the  Ground,  as  do %0a%3c the  Hens  ;  or  they  stand  up,  as  the  Cranes.  Of  Eggs,  some %0a%3c are  white,  as  those  of  Doves  and  Partridges;  others  are  pale, %0a%3c as  those  of  Water-fowl :  some  spotted,  as  in  the  Turkey- %0a%3c hens  (Meleager),  others,  again,  reddish ;  as  those  of  Phea- %0a%3c sants (Phasiani),  and  Cenchrides. %0a%3c %0a%3c All  Birds'  Eggs  within  the  Shell  are  of  two  Colours.  In %0a%3c Water-fowls,  the  Yolk  is  more  than  the  White,  and  the  same %0a%3c is  more  duskish  than  in  others.  The  Eggs  of  Fishes  are  of %0a%3c one  Colour,  and  in  them  there  is  no  White.  Birds'  Eggs  are %0a%3c brittle,  by  reason  of  the  Heat :  Serpents'  Eggs  are  more %0a%3c tough,  because  of  the  Cold  :  but  those  of  Fishes  are  soft, %0a%3c from  the  Liquid.  Those  of  such  Creatures  as  live  in  Water %0a%3c are  round  :  others  are,  for  the  most  part,  pointed  at  the  top. %0a%3c Birds  lay  their  Eggs  with  the  roundest  End  foremost :  the %0a%3c Shell  being  soft;  but  presently  they  harden  according  as  the %0a%3c Portions  protrude.  Horatius  Flaccus  is  of  opinion,  that  the %0a%3c longer  the  Egg  is,  the  better  they  taste.  The  rounder  Eggs %0a%3c produce  Hens,  the  others  yield  Cocks.  The  Navel  of  the  Egg %0a%3c is  beneath  the  top ;  or  it  is  a  prominent  Drop  in  the  Shell. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Propagation  of  Eggs :  the  Sitting  of  Birds,  and  their %0a%3c manner  of  Embrace. %0a%3c %0a%3c SOME  Birds   associate  in  breeding  at  all  Times  of  the %0a%3c %0a%3c O %0a%3c %0a%3c Year,  as  the  Barn-door  Fowls ;  and  they  lay  with  only  the %0a%3c Intermission  of  two  Months  in  Mid-winter.  Of  those,  Pul- %0a%3c lets lay  more  than  old  Hens,  but  the  Eggs  are  less,  espe- %0a%3c cially the  first  and  last.  So  fruitful  are  they,  that  some  of %0a%3c them  will  lay  threescore  Eggs:  some  lay  every  Day;  others, %0a%3c twice  a  Day  :  and  some  will  so  over-lay,  that  they  become %0a%3c worn  out,  and  die.  The  Hens  called  Hadrianae  are  ac- %0a%3c counted best.  Doves  (Columbse)  lay  ten  Times  in  the  Year, %0a%3c and  sometimes  eleven :  and  in  Egypt  they  continue  even  in %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  What  these  are  seems  uncertain.
