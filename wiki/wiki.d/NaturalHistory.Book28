(I.)-INTItODUCTIOH. %0a%0aWr should have now concluded our description of the various %0athings 1 that are produced between the heavens and the earth, %0aand it would have only remained for us to speak of the sub¬ %0astances that are dug out of the ground itself; did not our expo¬ %0asition of the remedies derived from plants and shrubs neces¬ %0asarily lead us into a digression upon the medicinal properties %0awhich have been discovered, to a still greater extent, in those %0aliving creatures themselves which are thus indebted [to other %0aobjects] for the cure of their respective maladies. For ought we, %0aafter describing the plants, the forms of the various flowers, and %0aso many objects rare and difficult to be found—ought we to pass %0ain silence the resources which exist in man himself for the %0abenefit of man, and the other remedies to be derived from the %0acreatures that live among us—and this more particularly, %0aseeing that life itself is nothing short of a punishment, unless %0ait is exempt from pains and maladies ? Assuredly not; and %0aeven though I may incur the risk of being tedious, I shall %0aexert all my energies on the subject, it beiug my fixed deter¬ %0amination to pay less regard to what may be amusing, than to %0awhat may prove practically useful to mankind. %0a%0aNay, even more than this, my researches will extend to the %0ausages of foreign countries, and to the customs of barbarous %0anations, subjects upon which I shall have to appeal to the %0agood faith of other authors ; though at the same time I have %0amade it my object to select no 2 facts but such as are established %0a%0a1 The trees and plants. %0a%0aJ On the contrary, this and the four following Books are full of the most %0aeitravagant assertions, which bear ample testimony to his credulity, not¬ %0awithstanding the author’s repeated declarations that he does not believe in %0aMagic. As Ajasson says, he evidently does not know what he ought to %0ahave inserted in his work, and what to reject as utterly unworthy of belief. %0aHis faults, however, were not so much his own as those of his age. Want %0a°t space, equally with want of inclination, compels us to forego the task of %0aentering into an examination of the system of Animal Therapeutics upon %0a’diich so much labour has been wasted by our author. %0a%0a.

These additional details %0atherefore, though of a different nature, must still be read in %0aconnexion with those whieh precede. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MAN. %0a%0aWe will begin then with man, and our first enquires will %0abe into the resources which he provides for himself—a subject %0areplete with boundless difficulties at the very outset. 3 %0a%0aEpileptic patients are in the habit of drinking the blood %0aeven of gladiators, draughts teeming with life, 1 as it were; a %0athing that, when we see it done by the wild beasts even, upon %0athe same arena, inspires us with horror at the spectacle! And %0ayet these persons, forsooth, consider it a most effectual cure %0afor their disease, to quaff the warm, breathing, blood from man %0ahimself, and, as they apply their mouth to the wound, to draw %0aforth his very life; and this, though it is regarded as an act %0aof impiety to apply the human lips to the wound even of a %0awild beast! Others there are, again, who make the marrow 4 %0aof the leg-bones, and the brains of infants, the objects of their %0aresearch! %0a%0aAmong the Greek writers, too, there are not a few who have %0aenlarged upon the distinctive flavours of each one of the viscera %0aand members of the human body, pursuing their researches %0ato the very parings of the nails ! as though, forsooth, it could %0a%0a2 See B. viii. c. 97, et seq., and B. xxv. c. 89, et seq. %0a%0a3 See B. xxviii. c. 3. %0a%0a4 This practice is mentioned with reprobation by Celsus and Tertullian. %0aIt was continued, however, in some degree through the middle ages, and %0aLouis XV. was accused by his people of taking baths of infants’ blood to %0arepair his premature decrepitude. %0a%0a5 In recent times, Guettard, a French practitioner, recommended human %0amarrow as an emollient liniment. %0a%0a%0aIChap. 2.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES DERIVED EDOM MAX. %0a%0a%0a2 77 %0a%0a%0apossibly be accounted the pursuit of health for man to make %0ahimself a wild beast, and so deserve to contract disease from %0athe very remedies he adopts for avoiding it. Most righteously, %0aby Hercules! if such attempts are all in vain, is he disap¬ %0apointed of his cure ! To examine human entrails is deemed %0aan net of impiety ; 6 * 8 what then must it be to devour them ? %0a%0aSay, Osthanes, 7 who was it that first devised these practices; %0afor it is thee that I accuse, thou uprooter of all human laws, %0athou inventor of these monstrosities ; devised, no doubt, with %0athe view that mankind might not forget thy name ! Who was %0ait that first thought of devouring each member of the human %0abody? By what conjectural motives was he induced ? What %0acan possibly have been the origin of such a system of medicine as %0athis? Who was it that thus made the very poisons less baneful %0athan the antidotes prescribed for them ? Granted that barbarous %0aand outlandish tribes first devised such practices, must the %0amen of Greece, too, adopt these as arts of their own ? %0a%0aWe read, for instance, in the memoirs of Democritus, still %0aextant, that for some diseases, the skull of a malefactor is most %0aefficacious, while for the treatment of others, that of one who %0ahas been a friend or guest is required. Apollonius, again, in¬ %0aforms us in his writings, that the most effectual remedy for %0atooth-ache is to scarify the gums with the tooth of a man who %0ahas died a violent death; and, according to Miletus, human gall %0ais a cure for cataract. 8 For epilepsy, Artemon has prescribed %0awater drawn from a spring in the night, and drunk from the %0askull of a man who has been slain, and whose body remains %0aunburnt. From the skull, too, of a man who had been hanged, %0aAntrnus made pills that were to be an antidote to the bite of a %0amad dog. Even more than this, man has resorted to similar re¬ %0amedies for the cure of four-footed beasts even—for tympanitis in %0aoxen, for instance, the horns have been perforated, and human %0abones inserted ; and when swine have been found to be diseased, %0a%0a6 Hence, as Ajasson remarks, the ignorance of anatomy displayed by the %0aancients. %0a%0a5 For further particulars as to Osthanes, see B. xxix. c. 80, and B. xx.\. %0acc. 5 and 6; also cc. 19 and 77 of the present Book. The reading, how¬ %0aever, is very doubtful. %0a%0a8 “ Oculorum suffusiones.” As Ajasson says, the remedy here mentioned %0areminds us of the more harmless one used by Tobias for the cure of the %0ablindness of his father Tobit. %0a%0a%0a%0apuny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0a278 %0a%0a%0afine wheat has been given them which has lain for a night in %0athe spot where a human being has been slain or burnt ! %0a%0aFar from us, far too from our writings, be such prescrip¬ %0ations 9 as these ! It will be for us to describe remedies only, %0aand not abominations ; 10 cases, for instance, in which the milk %0aof a nursing woman may have a curative effect, cases where %0athe human spittle may be useful, or the contact 11 of the human %0abody, and other instances of a similar nature. We donotlook %0aupon life as so essentially desirable that it must be prolonged %0aat any cost, be it what it may—and you, who are of that %0aopinion, be assured, whoever you may be, that you will die %0anone the less, even though you shall have lived in the midst %0aof obscenities or abominations ! %0a%0aLet each then reckon this as one great solace to his mind, %0athat of all the blessings whichNature has bestowed on man, %0athere is none greater than the death 1 - which comes at a season¬ %0aable hour; and that the very best feature in connexion with it %0ais, that every person has it in his own power to procure it for %0ahimself. 13 %0a%0aCnAP. 3. (2.)- WHETHER WORDS ARE POSSESSED OF ANY %0a%0aHEALING EFFICACY. %0a%0aIn reference to the remedies derived from man, there arises %0afirst of all one question, of the greatest importance and always %0aattended with the same uncertainty, whether words, charms, %0aand incantations, are of any efficacy or not? 14 For if such %0ais the case, it will be only proper to ascribe this efficacy to %0aman himself ; 15 though the wisest of our feUow T -men, I should %0aremark, taken individually, refuse to place the slightest faith %0ain these opinions. And yet, in our every-day life, we practi¬ %0acally show, each passing hour, that we do entertain this belief, %0a%0a5 He gives a great many, however, which are equally abominable. %0a%0a10 *' Piacula.” %0a%0a11 We may here discover the first rudiments of the doctrine of Animal %0aMagnetism. %0a%0a12 In accordance with the republican doctrines of Cato of Utica, Brutus, %0aCassius, and Portia. %0a%0a13 Holland remarks, “ Looke for no better divinitie in Plinie, a meere %0aPagan, Epicurean, and professed Atheist.” See B. vii. cc. 53, 54. %0a%0a14 Whether or not, they cannot, as Ajasson remarks, be regarded as %0aremedies derived from the human body, being no part of the human body. %0a%0a15 “ Homini acceptum fieri oportere conveniat.” This passage is pro¬ %0abably corrupt. %0a%0a%0achap. 3.] WOETHEli WOIiDS AHE OF liEAEIKG EFFICACST. 2/9 %0a%0athough at the moment we are not sensible of it. Thus for %0ainstance, it is a general belief that without a certain form of %0aprajer 18 it would be useless to immolate a victim, and that %0awith such an informality, the gods would be consulted to little %0apurpose. And then besides, there are different forms of %0aaddress to the deities, one form for entreating, 17 another form for %0aaverting their ire, and another for commendation. %0a%0aVe see too, how that our supreme magistrates use certain %0aformulae for their prayers: that not a single word may be %0aomitted or pronounced out of its place, it is the duty of one %0aperon to precede the dignitary by reading the formula before %0ahim from a written ritual, of another, to keep watch upon %0aever: word, and of a third to see that 18 silence is not ominously %0abroken; while a musician, in the meantime, is performing on the %0afluteto prevent any other words being heard. 19 Indeed, there %0aarenemorable instances recorded in our Annals, of cases where %0aeithir the sacrifice has been interrupted, and so blemished, %0aby iiprecations, or a mistake has been made in the utterance %0aofthtprayer; the result being that the lobe of the liver or %0athe hurt has disappeared in a moment, or has been doubled, 20 %0awhile he victim stood before the altar. There is still in exist¬ %0aence amost remarkable testimony, 21 in the formula which the %0aDecii,ather and son, pronounced on the occasions -when they %0adevote themselves. 22 There is also preserved the prayer %0auttereeby the Vestal Tuccia, 23 when, upon being accused of %0aincest, ie carried water in a sieve—an event which took place %0ain the jar of the City 609. Our own age even has seen a %0aman an a woman buried alive in tbe Ox Market, 24 Greeks by %0abirth, o else natives of some other 24 country with which we %0a%0a16 Begoing with an address to Janus and Vesta, imploring their inter¬ %0acession the other divinities, and concluding with an appeal to Janus. %0a%0a17 “Imtritis.” %0a%0a18 “Quavere linguis jubeat.” “ Favete linguis ” were the words used %0ain cnjoinii strict silence. %0a%0a1S By hi who is offering up the prayer. %0a%0a•" A tricadroitly performed by the priests, no doubt. %0a%0a21 Giveny Livy, in Books viii. and x. %0a%0aTo dci, in battle, for the good of their country. %0a%0a:s Presold by Valerius Maximus, B. viii. c. 1.

The prayer used upon the oocanoo %0aof this ceremonial, and which is usually pronounced first by %0athe Master of the College of the Quindecimvin* if read oy a %0aperson, must assuredly force him to admit the potency of %0aformulae; when it is recollected that it has been provri to %0abe effectual by the experience of eight hundred and tnrty %0a%0a^At’the present day, too, it is a general belief, that our V«tal %0avirgins have the power, by uttenng a certain prayer, to arost %0athe flight of runaway slaves, and to rivet them to the set, %0aprovided they have not gone beyond the precincts of the %0aCity If then these opinions be once received as truth, anal it %0ahe admitted that the gods do listen to certain prayers, (rare %0ainfluenced by set forms of words, we are bound to coidude %0ain the affirmative upon the whole question.

First describing, on the ground before him, the outline %0aof a temple with his staff—“ Is it so, Romans, as you say ?” %0asaid he; “here then must be the temple 29 of Jupiter, all good %0aand all powerful; it is here that we have found the head”— %0aand the constant asseveration of the Annals is, that the destiny %0aof the Roman empire would have been assuredly transferred to %0aEtruria, had not the deputies, forewarned by the son of the %0adimer, made answer—“ No, not here exactly, but at Rome, %0awe say, the head was found.” %0a%0aIt is related also that the same was the case when a certain %0afour-horse chariot, made of clay, and intended for the roof of %0athe same temple, had considerably increased while in the %0afurnace ; 80 and that on this occasion, in a similar manner, the %0adestinies of Rome were saved. Let these instances suffice %0athen to show, that the virtues of presages lie in our own hands, %0aand that they are valuable in each instance according as they %0aare received. 31 At all events, it is a principle in the doctrine %0aof the augurs, that neither imprecations nor auspices of any %0akind have any effect upon those who, when entering upon an %0aundertaking, declare that they will pay no attention whatever %0ato them; a greater instance than wffiich, of the indulgent dis¬ %0aposition of the gods towards us, cannot be found. %0a%0aAnd then besides, in the laws themselves of the Twelve %0aTables, do we not read the following words—“Whosoever shall %0ahave enchanted the harvest,” 32 and in another place, “ Whoso¬ %0aever shall have used pernicious incantations”? 33 Yerrius Flac- %0acus cites authors whom he deems worthy of credit, to show %0athat on the occasion of a siege, it was the usage, the first thing of %0aall, for the Roman priests to summon forth the tutelary divinity %0aof that particular town, and to promise him the same rites, or %0aeven a more extended worship, at Rome; and at the present day %0aeven, this ritual still forms part of the discipline of our pontiffs. %0a%0as * Ajasson thinks that there is an equivoque here upon the word “tern- %0aplum,” which signified not only a building, but certain parts of the heavens, %0aand corresponding lines traced on the earth by the augur’s staff. %0a%0a30 This story is mentioned by Plutarch, in the Life of Publicola. %0a%0a51 In which case it was considered necessary to repeat the words, “ Ac- %0acipio omen,” “ I accept the omen.” %0a%0a13 “Qui fruges excantassit.” %0a%0aM “ Qui nudum carmen incantassit." %0a%0a%0a282 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aHence it is, no doubt, that the name 34 of the tutelary deity of %0aHome has been so strictly kept concealed, lest any of our enemies %0ashould act in a similar manner. There is no one, too, who does %0anot dread being spell-bound by means of evil imprecations ; 3t and %0ahence the practice, after eating eggs or snails, of immedi¬ %0aately breaking 36 the shells, or piercing them with the spoon. %0aHence, too, those love-sick imitations of enchantments which %0awe find described by Theocritus among the Greeks, and by %0aCatullus, and more recently, Virgil , 37 among our own writers. %0aMany persons are fully persuaded that articles .of pottery may %0abe broken by a similar agency; and not a few are of opinion %0aeven that serpents can counteract incantations, and that this is %0athe only kind of intelligence they possess—so much so, in fact, %0athat by the agency of the magic spells of the Marsi, they may %0abe attracted to one spot, even when asleep in the middle of the %0anight. Some people go so far, too, as to write certain words 38 %0aon the walls of houses, deprecatory of accident by fire. %0a%0aBut it is not easy to say whether the outlandish and unpro¬ %0anounceable words that are thus employed, or the Latin ex¬ %0apressions that are used at random, and which must appear %0aridiculous to our judgment, tend the most strongly to stagger %0aour belief—seeing that the human imagination is always con¬ %0aceiving something of the infinite, something deserving of the %0anotice of the divinity, or indeed, to speak more correctly, some¬ %0athing that must command his intervention perforce. Homer 38 %0atells us that Ulysses arrested the flow of blood from a wound %0a%0a34 Ajasson is of opinion that this name was either Favra or Fona, Acca, %0aFlora, or Yalesia or Yalentia. %0a%0a' 35 “As in saying thus, The Devill take thee, or The Ravens peck out %0athine eyes, or I had rather see thee Pie peckt, and such like.”— Holland. %0a%0a36 It is a superstition still practised to pierce the shell of an egg after %0aeating it, “ lest the witches should come.” Holland gives the following %0aNote—“ Because afterwards no witches might pricke them with a needle %0ain the name and behalfe of those whom they would hurt and mischeefe, %0aaccording to the practice of pricking the images of any person in wax; %0aused in the witchcraft of these daies.” We learn from Ajasson that till %0arecently it was considered a mark of ill-breeding in France not to pierce %0athe shell after eating the egg.

III. p. 19, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a37 See the Eighth Eclogue of Virgil. %0a%0a38 “That is to say, Arse verse , out of Afranius, as Festus noteth, which %0ain the old Tuscane language signifieth, Averte ignem, Put backe the fire.” %0a— Holland. %0a%0a3J Odyss. xix. 457.

Cato 41 has %0apreserved a formula for the cure of sprains, and M. Yarro for %0athat of gout. The Dictator Caesar, they say, having on one %0aoccasion accidentally had a fall in his chariot, 42 was always in %0athe habit, immediately upon taking his seat, of thrice repeating %0aa certain formula, with the view of ensuring safety upon the %0ajourney ; a thing that, to my own knowledge, is done by many %0apersons at the present day. %0a%0aCHAP. 5.- A DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS USAGES. %0a%0aI would appeal, too, for confirmation on this subject, to the %0aintimate experience of each individual. "Why, in fact, upon %0athe first day of the new year, do we accost one another witli %0aprayers for good fortune, 43 and, for luck’s sake, wish each other %0aa happy new year ? AVhy, too, upon the occasion of public %0alustrations, do we select persons with lucky names, to lead the %0aTictiras ? Why, to counteract fascinations, do we Romans %0aobserve a peculiar form of adoration, in invoking the Nemesis %0aof the Greeks; whose statue, for this reason, has been placed %0ain the Capitol at Rome, although the goddess herself possesses %0ano Latin name? 44 Why, when we make mention of the dead, %0ado we protest that we have no wish 45 to impeach their good %0aname ? w Why is it that we entertain the belief that for every %0apurpose odd numbers are the most effectual ; 47 —a thing that is %0aparticularly observed with reference to the critical days in %0afevers? Why is it that, when gathering the earliest fruit, %0aapples, or pears, as the case may be, we make a point of saying %0a—“This fruit is old, may other fruit be sent ns that is new ? ” %0aWhy is it that we salute 48 a person when he sneezes, an obser¬ %0avance which Tiberius Caesar, they say, the most unsociable of %0amen, as we all know, used to exact, when riding in his chariot %0a%0a40 De Enthusiasmo. 41 See B. xvii. c. 47. %0a%0a42 In passing along the Velabrum,on the occasion of his Gallic triumph, %0athe axle of the carriage having broke. %0a%0a43 Sec Ovid’s Fasti, B. i. 1. 175, et scq., and Epist. de Ponto.

III. p. 123, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0a%0a284 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Cook XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aeven ? Some there are, too, who think it a point religiously %0ato be observed to mention the name as well of the person whom %0athey salute. %0a%0aAnd then, besides, it is a notion 49 universally received, that %0aabsent persons have warning that others are speaking of them, %0aby the tingling of the ears. Attalus 60 assures us, that if a %0aperson, the moment he sees a scorpion, says “ Duo,” 61 the rep- %0atile will stop short, and forbear to sting. And now that I am %0aspeaking of the scorpion, I recall to mind that in Africa no one %0aever undertakes any matter without prefacing with the word %0a“ Africawhile in other countries, before an enterprise is %0acommenced, it is the practice to adjure the gods that they %0awill manifest their good will. %0a%0aIn addition to this, it is very clear that there are some %0areligious observances,' unaccompanied by speech, which are %0aconsidered to be productive of certain effects. Thus, 62 when %0awe are at table, for instance, it is the universal practice, we %0asee, to take the ring from off the finger. Another person, %0aagain, will take some spittle from his mouth and place it with %0ahis finger behind the ear, to propitiate and modify disquietude %0aof mind. When we wish to signify applause, we have a proverb %0aeven which tells us we should press the thumbs. 63 When pay¬ %0aing adoration, we kiss the right hand, and turn the whole %0abody to the right: while the people of the Gallic provinces, on %0athe contrary, turn to the left, and believe that they show %0amere devoutness by so doing. To salute summer lightning %0awith clapping of the hands, is the universal practice with all %0anations. If, when eating, we happen to make mention of a %0afire that has happened, we avert the inauspicious omen by pour¬ %0aing water beneath the table. To sweep the floor at the moment %0athat a person is rising from table, or to remove the table %0aor tray, 64 as the case may be, while a guest is drinking, is %0alooked upon as a most unfortunate presage. There is a treatise, %0a%0a49 In France and England, at the present day, this notion, or rather, per¬ %0ahaps, the memory of it, is universally to be found.

Where a %0aperson has sneezed, it is considered highly ominous for the %0adish or table to be brought back again, and not a taste thereof %0ato be taken, after doing so; the same, too, where a person at %0atable eats nothing at all. %0a%0aThese usages have been established by persons who enter¬ %0atained a belief that the gods are ever present, in all our affairs %0aand at all hours, and who have therefore found the means of ap¬ %0apeasing them by our vices even. It has been remarked, too, %0athat there is never a dead silence on a sudden among the guests %0aat table, except when there is an even number present; when %0athis happens, too, it is a sign that the good name and repute of %0aevery individual present is in peril. In former times, when %0afood fell from the hand of a guest, it was the custom to return %0ait by placing it on the table, and it was forbidden 56 to blow %0aupon it, for the purpose of cleansing it. Auguries, too, have been %0aderived from the words or thoughts of a person at the moment %0asuch an accident befalls him ; and it is looked upon as one of %0athe most dreadful of presages, if this should happen to a pontiff, %0awhile celebrating the feast of Dis. 67 The proper expiation in %0asuch a case is, to have the morsel replaced on table, and then %0aburnt in honour of the Lar. 58 Medicines, it is said, will prove %0aineffectual, if they happen to have been placed on a table before %0athey are administered. It is religiously believed by many, %0athat it is ominous in a pecuniary point of view, for a person to %0apare his nails without speaking, on the market days 59 at Rome, %0aor to begin at the forefinger 60 in doing so : it is thought, too, %0a%0a55 It was not yet the custom to bring in several courses, each served up %0aon a separate table. %0a%0a,>6 Good manners possibly, more than superstition, may have introduced %0athis practice. %0a%0a57 Or Pluto.

It is not so long ago, that M. Servilius %0aNonianus, the principal citizen at Rome , 03 being apprehensive %0aof ophthalmia, had a paper, with the two Greek letters P and %0aA 61 written upon it, wrapped in linen and attached to his neck, %0abefore he would venture to name the malady, and before any %0aother person had spoken to him about it. Mucianus, too, who %0awas thrice consul, following a similar observance, carried about %0ahim a living fly, wrapped in a piece of white linen; and it %0awas strongly asserted, by both of them, that to the use of these %0aexpedients they owed their preservation from ophthalmia. %0aThere are in existence, also, certain charms against hail-storms, %0adiseases of various kinds, and burns, some of which have been %0aproved, by actual experience, to be effectual; but so great is the %0adiversity of opinion upon them, that I am precluded by a %0afeeling of extreme diffidence from entering into further par¬ %0aticulars, and must therefore leave each to form his own con¬ %0aclusions as he may feel inclined. %0a%0aCHAP. 6. (3.)-TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX OBSERVATIONS %0a%0aON REMEDIES DERIVED EKOM MAN. EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED %0aFROM CHILDREN. %0a%0aWe have already ", 65 when speaking of the singular peculiar¬ %0aities of various nations, made mention of certain men of a %0amonstrous nature, whose gaze is endowed with powers of %0afascination; and we have also described properties belonging to %0anumerous animals, which it would be superfluous here to repeat. %0aIn some men, the whole of the body is endowed with remark¬ %0aable properties, as in those families, for instance, which are a %0aterror to serpents; it being in their power to cure persons %0awhen stung, either by the touch or by r a slight suction of the %0awound. To this class belong the Psylli, the Marsi, and the people %0a60 * Twenty-eighth , according to our reckoning. %0a%0a61 Probably from their ominous resemblance to the Parcae, or Fates, with %0atheir spindles, 02 “Frugum.” %0a%0aes “ Princeps civitatis.” 64 “ Rho ” and “Alpha.” %0a%0a65 In B. vii. c. 2. %0a%0a%0aChap. 6.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES DEBITED FROM MAH. %0a%0a%0a287 %0a%0a%0acalled “Ophiogenes ,” 66 in the Isle of Cyprus. One Euagon, %0aa member of this family, while attending upon a deputation at %0aRome, was thrown by way of experiment, by order of the con¬ %0asuls, into a large vessel 67 filled with serpents; upon which, %0ato the astonishment of all, they licked his body all over with %0atheir tongues. One peculiarity of this family—if indeed it is %0astill in existence—is the strong offensive smell which proceeds %0afrom their body in the spring ; their sweat, too, no less than %0atheir spittle, was possessed of remedial virtues. The people %0awho are born at Tentyris, an island in the river Nilus, are %0aso formidable 68 to the crocodiles there, that their voice even is %0asufficient to put them to flight. The presence even, it is well %0aknown, of all these different races, will suffice for the cure of %0ainjuries inflicted by the animals to which they respectively %0ahave an antipathy; just in the same way that wounds are %0airritated by the approach of persons who have been stung by %0aa serpent at some former time, or bitten by a dog. Such %0apersons, too, by their presence, will cause the eggs upon which %0aa hen is sitting to be addled, and will make pregnant cattle %0acast their young and miscarry; for, in fact, so much of %0athe venom remains in their body, that, from being poisoned %0athemselves, they become poisonous to other creatures. The %0aproper remedy in such case is first to make them wash their %0ahands, and then to sprinkle with the water the patient who is %0aunder medical treatment. When, again, persons have been %0aonce stung by a scorpion they will never afterwards be attacked %0aby hornets, wasps, or bees: a fact at which a person will be %0athe less surprised when he learns that a garment which has %0abeen worn at a funeral will never be touched by moths ; 69 that %0ait is hardly possible to draw serpents from their holes except %0aby using the left hand; and that, of the discoveries made by %0aPythagoras, one of the most unerring, is the fact, that in the %0aname given to infants, an odd number of vowels is portentous %0aof lameness, loss of eyesight, or similar accidents, on 70 the right %0a%0aM In B. vii. c. 2, he speaks of these people—“ the serpent-born”—as %0anatives of Parium, a town of the Hellespont.

It is said, that if a person takes a stone or other missile %0awhich has slain three living creatures, a man, a boar, and a %0abear, at three blows, and throws it over the roof of a house %0ain which there is a pregnant woman, her delivery, however %0adifficult, will be instantly accelerated thereby. In such a case, %0atoo, a successful result will be rendered all the more probable, %0aif a light infantry lance 71 is used, which has been drawn from %0aa man’s body without touching the earth; indeed, if it is %0abrought into the house it will be productive of a similar result. %0aIn the same way, too, we find it stated in the writings of %0aOrpheus and Archelaiis, that arrows, drawn from a human %0abody without being allowed to touch the ground, and placed %0abeneath the bed, will have all the effect of a philtre; and, %0awhat is even more than this, that it is a cure for epilepsy if %0athe patient eats the flesh of a wild beast killed with an iron %0aweapon with which a human being has been slain. %0a%0aSome individuals, too, are possessed of medicinal properties %0ain certain parts of the body; the thumb of King Pyrrhus, for %0ainstance, as already 72 mentioned. At Elis, there used to %0abe shown one of the ribs 73 of Pelops, which, it was generally %0aasserted, was made of ivory. At the present day even, there %0aare many persons, who from religious motives will never clip %0athe hair growing upon a mole on the face. %0a%0achap. 7.—properties op the human spittle. %0a%0aBut it is the fasting spittle of a human being, that is, as %0aalready 71 stated by us, the sovereign preservative against the %0apoison of serpents; while, at the same time, our daily experience %0amay recognize its efficacy and utility, 75 in many other respects. %0aWe are in the habit of spitting, 76 for instance, as a preservative %0afrom epilepsy, or in other words, we repel contagion thereby: %0a%0a71 “ Hasta velitaris.” 72 In B. vii. c. 2. %0a%0a73 It is the shoulder-blade of Pelops that is generally mentioned in the %0aancient Mythology. Pliny omits to say of what medicinal virtues it was %0apossessed. 71 In B. vii. c. 2. %0a%0a75 It certainly does seem to be possessed of some efficacy for the removal %0aof spots and stains, but for no other purpose probably. %0a%0a76 In some parts of France, the peasants spit in the hand when in terror %0aof spectres at night. In our country, prize-fighters spit in the hand before %0abeginning the combat, and costermongers spit on their morning’s handsel, %0aor first earned money, for good luck. %0a%0a%0aChap. 7.] PUOPKETIES OF THE HUMAN SPITTLE- %0a%0a%0a289 %0a%0a%0ain a similar manner, too, we repel fascinations, and the evil %0apresages attendant upon meeting a person who is lame in the %0aright leg. We ask pardon of the gods, by spitting in 77 the %0alap, for entertaining some too presumptuous hope or expecta¬ %0ation. 76 On the same principle, it is the practice in all cases %0awhere medicine is employed, to spit three times on the ground, %0aand to conjure the malady as often; the object being to aid the %0aoperation of the remedy employed. It is usual, too, to mark %0aa boil, when it first makes its appearance, three times with %0afasting 79 spittle. What we are going to say is marvellous, %0abut it may easily be tested 80 by experiment: if a person re¬ %0apents of a blow given to another, either by hand or with a %0amissile, he has nothing to do but to spit at once into the palm %0aof the hand which has inflicted the blow, and all feelings 81 of %0aresentment will be instantly alleviated in the person struck. %0aThis, too, is often verified in the case of a beast of burden, %0awhen brought on its haunches with blows; for upon this remedy %0abeing adopted, the animal will immediately step out and mend %0aits pace. Some persons, however, before making an effort, spit %0ainto the hand in manner above stated, in order to make the %0ablow more heavy. 82 %0a%0aWe may well believe, then, that lichens and leprous spots %0amay be removed by a constant application of fasting spittle ; %0athat ophthalmia may be cured by anointing, as it were, the %0aeyes every morning with fasting spittle; that carcinomata %0amay be effectually treated, by kneading the root of the plant %0aknown as “ apple of the earth,” 86 with human spittle; that %0acrick in the neck may be got rid of by carrying fasting spittle %0ato the right knee with the right hand, and to the left knee %0awith the left; and that when an insect has got into the ear, it %0a%0a77 “In sinum.” 18 See Juvenal, Sat. v. 1. 112. %0a%0a79 Ajasson remarks that the human spittle contains hydrochlorate of %0asoda and potash; the remedial virtues of which, however, would be in¬ %0afinitely small. %0a%0a80 A quibble, Ajasson remarks. Did Pliny ever test it himself? He %0awould seem to imply it. %0a%0a81 “ Levatur illico in percusso culpa.’’ %0a%0a82 This is still the case with pugilists, and persons requiring to use strong %0aexertion. It is based, however, on a mere superstition, as Ajasson remarks. %0a%0a83 “Malum teme.” See B. xxv. c. 54, and B. xxvi. c. 56. Littre %0atranslates “ malum,” “ apple,” in the former passage; hut here he calls it %0a“curse of the earth.” %0a%0aVOL. V. %0a%0a%0au %0a%0a%0a290 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0ais quite sufficient to spit into that organ, to make it come out. %0aAmong the counter-charms too, are reckoned, the practice of %0aspitting into the urine the moment it is voided, of spitting into %0athe shoe of the right foot before putting it on, and of spitting %0awhile a person is passing a place in which he has incurred any %0akind of peril. %0a%0aMarcion of Smyrna, who has written a work on the virtues %0aof simples, informs us that the sea scolopendra will burst %0aasunder if spit upon; and that the same is the case with bram¬ %0able-frogs, 84 and other kinds of frogs. Opilius says that serpents %0awill do the same, if a person spits into their open mouth; and %0aSalpe tells us, that when any part of the body is asleep, the %0anumbness may be got rid of by the person spitting into his %0alap, or touching the upper eyelid with his spittle. If we are %0aready to give faith to such statements as these, we must be¬ %0alieve also in the efficacy of the following practices: upon the %0aentrance of a stranger, or when a person looks at an infant %0awhile asleep, it is usual for the nurse to spit three times upon %0athe ground ; and this, although infants are under the especial %0aguardianship of the god Fascinus, 65 the protector, not of infants %0aonly, but of generals as well, and a divinity whose worship is %0aentrusted to the Yestal virgins, and forms part of the Koman %0arites. It is the image of this divinity that is attached beneath %0athe triumphant car of the victorious general, protecting him, %0alike some attendant physician, against the effects of envy; M %0awhile, at the same time, equally salutary is the advice of the %0atongue, which warns him to be wise in time, 87 that so Fortune %0a%0a81 “Rubetas.” See B. viii. c. 48, B. xi. cc. 19, 76, and 116, and B. %0axxv. c. 76. %0a%0a85 This divinity was identical with Mutinus or Tutinus, and was %0aworshipped under the form of a phallus, the male generative organ. As %0athe guardian of infants, his peculiar form is still unconsciously represented %0ain the shape of the coral bauble with which infants are aided in cutting %0atheir teeth. %0a%0a88 Hence the expression “ prsefiscini,” “ Be it said without envy,” sup¬ %0aposed to avert the effects of the envious eye, fascination, or enchantment. %0a%0a81 “ Resipiscere” seems to be a preferable reading to “respicere,” adopted %0aby Sillig. This passage is evidently in a very corrupt state; but it is most %0aprobable that reference is made to the attendant who stood behind the %0ageneral in his triumph, and reminded him that he was a man—or, according %0ato Tzetzes, bade him look behind him. Pliny speaks of a servant attending %0athe triumphant general, with a golden crown, in B. xxxiii. c. 4. Ilardouiu %0aattempts another explanation, but a very contused and improbable one. %0a%0a%0aChap. 9.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM THE HUMAN HAIR. 2 { J 1 %0a%0amay be prevailed upon by his prayers, not to follow, as the %0adestroyer of his glory, close upon his back. %0a%0aCHAP. 8.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE WAX OF THE HUMAN %0a%0aEAR. %0a%0aThe human bite is also looked upon as one of the most dan¬ %0agerous of all. The proper remedy for it is human ear-wax ; %0aa thing that we must not be surprised at, seeing that, if ap¬ %0aplied immediately, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions even, %0aand serpents. The best, however, for this purpose, is that %0ataken from the ears of the wounded person. Agnails, too, %0ait is said, may be cured in a similar manner. A human tooth, %0areduced to powder, is a cure, they say, for the sting of a ser¬ %0apent. %0a%0aCHAP. 9.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN HAIR, %0a%0aTEETH, ETC. %0a%0aThe first hair, it is said, that is cut from an infant’s head, %0aand, in fact, the hair of all persons that have not reached the %0aage of puberty, attached to the limbs, will modify the attacks %0aof gout. A man’s hair, applied with vinegar, is a cure for the %0abite of a dog, and, used with oil or wine, for wounds on the %0ahead. It is said, too, if we choose to believe it, that the hair %0aof a man torn down from the cross, is good for quartan fevers. %0aAshes, too, of burnt human hair are curative of carcinomata. %0aIf a woman takes the first tooth that a child has shed, provided %0ait has not touched the ground, and has it set in a bracelet, and %0awears it constantly upon her arm, it will preserve her from %0aall pains in the uterus and adjacent parts. If the great toe %0ais tied fast to the one next to it, it will reduce tumours in the %0agroin; and if the two middle fingers of the right hand are %0aslightly bound together with a linen thread, it will act as a %0apreservative against catarrhs and ophthalmia. A stone, it is %0asaid, that has been voided by a patient suffering from calculi, %0aif attached to the body above the pubes, will alleviate the %0apains of others similarly afflicted, as well as pains in the liver ; %0ait will have the effect, also, of facilitating delivery. Granius 68 %0aadds, however, that for thi3 last purpose, the stone will be more %0aefficacious if it has been extracted with the knife. Delivery, %0awhen near at hand, will be accelerated, if the man by whom %0a88 See end of the present Book. %0a%0aU 2 %0a%0a%0a292 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0athe woman has conceived, unties his girdle, and, after tying it %0around her, unties it, adding at the same time this formula, “ I %0ahave tied it, and I will untie it,” and then taking his de¬ %0aparture. %0a%0aCHAP. 10.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN BLOOD, THU %0a%0aSEXUAL CONGRESS, ETC. %0a%0aThe blood of the human body, come from what part it may, %0ais most efficacious, according to Orpheus and Archelaiis, as an %0aapplication for quinzy : they say, too, that if it is applied to %0athe mouth of a person who has fallen down in a fit of epilepsy, %0ahe will come to himself immediately. Some say that, for %0aepilepsy, the great toes should be pricked, and the drops of %0ablood that^gxude therefrom applied to the face; or else, that a %0avirgin should touch the patient with her right thumb—a cir¬ %0acumstance that has led to the belief that persons suffering from %0aepilepsy should eat the flesh of animals in a virgin state. %0aJjlschines of Athens used to cure quinzy, carcinoma, and affec¬ %0ations of the tonsillary glands and uvula, with the ashes of %0aburnt excrements, a medicament to which he gave the name %0aof “ botryon.” 89 %0a%0aThere are many kinds of diseases which disappear entirely %0aafter the first sexual congress, 90 or, in the case of females, at the %0afirst appearance of menstruation; indeed, if such is not the %0aease, they are apt to become chronic, epilepsy in particular. %0aEven more than this—a man, it is said, who has been stung %0aby a serpent or scorpion, experiences relief from the sexual %0acongress; but the woman, on the other hand, is sensible of %0adetriment. We are assured, too, that if persons, when washing %0atheir feet, touch the eyes three times with the water, they will %0anever be subject to ophthalmia or other diseases of the eyes. %0a%0aCHAP. 11.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE DEAD. %0a%0aScrofula, imposthumes of the parotid glands, and throat %0adiseases, they say, may be cured by the contact of the hand of %0aa person who has been carried off by an early death : jndeed %0athere are some who assert that any dead body will produce the %0asame effect, provided it is of the same sex as the patient, and %0a%0a89 Properly meaning “a cluster of grapes.” %0a%0a90 Ajasson remarks that there is a considerable degree of truth in this %0aassertion. He gives a long list of French works on the subject. %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] REVERIES AND DEVICES OF THE MAGICIANS. 293 %0a%0athat the part affected is touched with the back of the left %0ahand. 91 To bite off a piece from wood that has been struck 1 ' %0aby lightning, the hands being held behind the back, and then %0ato apply it to the tooth, is a sure remedy, they say, for tooth¬ %0aache. Some persons recommend the tooth to be fumigated %0a•with the smoke of a burnt tooth, which l5as belonged to another %0aperson of the same sex; or else to attach to the person a dog¬ %0atooth, as it is called, which has been extracted from a body %0abefore burial. Earth, they say, taken from out of a human %0askull, acts as a depilatory to the eyelashes; it is asserted, also, %0athat any plant which may happen to have grown there, if %0achewed, will cause the teeth to come out; and that if a circle %0ais traced round an ulcer with a human bone, it will be effec¬ %0atually prevented from spreading. %0a%0aSome persons, again, mix water in equal proportions from %0athree different wells, and, after making a libation with part of %0ait in a new earthen vessel, administer the rest to patients suf¬ %0afering from tertian fever, when the paroxysms come on. So, %0atoo, in cases of quartan fever, they take a fragment of a nail %0afrom a cross, or else a piece of a halter 93 that has been used %0afor crucifixion, and, after wrapping it in wool, attach it to the %0apatient’s neck; taking care, the moment he has recovered, to %0aconceal it in some hole to which the light of the sun cannot %0apenetrate. %0a%0aCHAP. 12.-VARIOUS REVERIES AND DEVICES OF THE MAGICIANS. %0a%0aThe following are some of the reveries of magic. 93 A whet¬ %0astone upon which iron tools have been frequently sharpened, %0aif put, without his being aware of it, beneath the pillow of a %0aperson sinking under the effects of poison, will make him give %0aevidence and declare what poison has been administered, and %0aat what time and place, though at the same time he will not %0adisclose the author of the crime. When a person has been %0a6truck by lightning, if the body is turned upon the side which %0ahas sustained the injury, he will instantly recover the power %0a%0a91 This superstition still exists among the lower classes of this country, %0awith reference to the beneficial effects of stroking neck diseases with the %0ahand of a man who has been hanged. %0a%0a92 Made of “ spartum.” See B. xix. cc. 6, 7. %0a%0a93 Of which the Persian Magi were the most noted professors. %0a%0a%0a294 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII, %0a%0a%0aof speech—that is quite certain. M For the cure of inguinal %0atumours, some persons take the thrum of an old web, and alter %0atying seven or nine knots in it, mentioning at each knot the %0aname of some widow woman or other, attach it to the part %0aaffected. To assuage the pain of a wound, they recommend %0athe party to take a nail or any other substance that has been %0atrodden under foot, and to wear it, attached to the body with %0athe thrum of a web. To get rid of w r arts, some lie in a %0afootpath with the face upwards, when the moon is twenty days %0aold at least, and after fixing their gaze upon it, extend their %0aarms above the head, and rub themselves with anything %0awithin their reach. If a person is extracting a corn at the %0amoment that a star shoots, he will experience an immediate %0acure, 95 they say. By pouring vinegar upon the hinges of a %0adoor, a thick liniment is formed, which, applied to the fore¬ %0ahead, will alleviate headache : an effect equally produced, we %0aare told, by binding the temples with a halter with which a %0aman has been hanged. When a fish-bone happens to stick in %0athe throat, it will go down immediately, if the person plunges %0ahis feet into cold water; but where the accident has happened %0awith any other kind of bone, the proper remedy is to apply %0ato the head some fragments of bones taken from the same dish. %0aIn cases where bread has stuck in the throat, the best plan is %0ato take some of the same bread, and insert it in both ears. %0a%0aCHAP. 13.- REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN EXCRETIONS. %0a%0aIn Greece, where everything is turned to account, the %0aowners of the gymnasia have introduced the very excretions 5 * %0aeven of the human body among the most efficient remedies; %0aso much so, indeed, that the scrapings from the bodies of the %0aathletes are looked upon as possessed of certain properties of %0aan emollient, calorific, resolvent, and expletive nature, re¬ %0asulting from the compound of human sweat and oil. These %0ascrapings are used, in the form of a pessary, for inflammations %0aand contractions of the uterus : similarly employed, they act %0aas an emmenagogue, and are useful for reducing condylomata %0aand inflammations of the rectum, as also for assuaging pains %0a%0a91 The “constat” here, whether it belongs to the magicians, or to Pliny %0ahimself, is highly amusing, as Ajasson remarks. %0a%0a95 Sillig Appears to be right in his conjecture that the “vel” here %0ashould be omitted. 96 See B. xv. c. 5. %0a%0a%0aChap. 14 ] BEMEDIE8 DEPENDING UPON THE WILD. 295 %0a%0ain the sinews, sprains, and nodosities of the joints. The %0ascrapings obtained from the baths are still more efficacious for %0athese purposes, and hence it is that they form an ingredient in %0amaturative preparations. Such scrapings as are impregnated %0awith wrestlers’ oil, 97 used in combination with mud, have a %0amollifying effect upon the joints, and are more particularly %0aefficacious as a calorific and resolvent; but in other respects %0atheir properties are not so strongly developed. %0a%0aThe shameless and disgusting researches that have been %0amade will quite transcend all belief, when we find authors of %0athe very highest repute proclaiming aloud that the male %0aseminal fluid is a sovereign remedy for the sting of the scor¬ %0apion ! In the case too, of women afflicted with sterility, they %0arecommend the application of a pessary, made of the first %0aexcrement that is voided by an infant at the moment of its %0abirth; the name they give it is “meconium.” 99 They have %0aeven gone so far, too, as to 6crape the very filth from off the %0awalls of the gymnasia, and to assert that this is also possessed %0aof certain calorific properties. These scrapings are used as a %0aresolvent for inflamed tumours, and are applied topically to %0aulcers upon aged people and children, and to excoriations and %0abums. %0a%0aCEAP. 14.-EEMEDIES DEPENDING UPON THE HUMAN WILL. %0a%0aIt would be the less becoming then for me to omit all %0amention of the remedies which depend upon the human will. %0aTotal abstinence from food or drink, or from wine only, from %0aflesh, or from the use of the bath, in cases where the health %0arequires any of these expedients, is looked upon as one of the %0amost effectual modes of treating diseases. To this class of %0aremedies must be added bodily exercise, exertion of the voice, 99 %0aanointings, and frictions according to a prescribed method: %0afor powerful friction, it should be remembered, has a binding %0aeffect upon the body, while gentle friction, on the other hand, %0aacts as a laxative; so too, repeated friction reduces the %0abody, while used in moderation it has a tendency to make %0allesh. But the most beneficial practice of all is to take walking %0a%0a97 “ Ceroma.” A mixture of oil and wax. %0a%0a98 Properly, “ poppy juice.” %0a%0a99 Or “ clara lectio,” “reading aloud,” as Celsus calls it, recommending %0ait for persons of slow digestion. %0a%0a%0a296 %0a%0a%0apunt’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aor carriage 1 exercise; this last being performed in various ways. %0aExercise on horseback is extremely good for affections of the %0astomach and hips, a voyage for phthisis, 2 and a change of %0alocality 3 for diseases of long standing. So, too, a cure may %0asometimes be effected by sleep, by a recumbent position in bed, %0aor by the use of emetics in moderation. To lie upon the back %0ais beneficial to the sight, to lie with the face downwards is %0agood for a cough, and to lie on the side is recommended for %0apatients suffering from catarrh. %0a%0aAccording to Aristotle and Eabianus, it is towards spring and %0aautumn that we are most apt to dream; and they tell us that %0apersons are most liable to do so when lying on the back, but %0anever when lying with the face downwards. Theophrastus %0aassures us that the digestion is accelerated by lying on the %0aright side; while, on the other hand, it is retarded by lying %0awith the face upwards. The most powerful, however, of all %0aremedies, and one which is always at a person’s own command, %0ais the sun: violent friction, too, is useful by the agency of %0alinen towels and body-scrapers. 4 To pour warm water on the %0ahead before taking the vapour-bath, and cold water after it, is %0alooked upon as a most beneficial practice; so, too, is the habit %0aof taking cold water before food, of drinking it every now and %0athen while eating, of taking it just before going to sleep, and, %0aif practicable, of waking every now and then, and taking a %0adraught. It is worthy also of remark, that there is no living %0acreature but man 5 that is fond of hot drinks, a proof that they %0aare contrary to nature. It has been ascertained by experiment, %0athat it is a good plan to rinse the mouth with undiluted wine, %0abefore going to sleep, for the purpose of sweetening the breath; %0ato rinse the mouth with cold water an odd number of times %0aevery morning, as a preservative against tooth-ache; and to %0awash the eyes with oxycrate, as a preventive of ophthalmia. %0aIt has been remarked also, that the general health is improved %0aby a varying regimen, subject to no fixed rules. %0a%0a1 “Gestatio.” Exercise on horseback, in a carriage drawn by horses, %0aor in a litter. See B. xxvi. c. 1. %0a%0a2 See B. xxxi. c. 33. A sea voyage, to Madeira, for instance, is still re¬ %0acommended for consumptive patients. %0a%0a3 Change of locality is still recommended for diseases of the spleen, as %0a%0athey are called. * “ Strigilium.” %0a%0as Except monkeys and some domesticated animals, Ajasson remarks. %0a%0a%0aChap. 16.] REMEDIES FBOM THE SEXUAL CONGRESS. 297 %0a%0a(5.) Hippocrates informs us that the viscera of persons who %0ado not take the morning meal 6 become prematurely aged and %0afeeble; hut then he has pronounced this aphorism, it must be %0aremembered, by way of suggesting a healthful regimen, and not %0ato promote gluttony; for moderation in diet is, after all, the %0athing most conducive to health. L. Luculhis gave charge to %0aone of his slaves to overlook him in this respect; and, a thing %0athat reflected the highest discredit on him, when, now an aged %0aman and laden with triumphs, he was feasting in the Capitol %0aeven, his hand had to be removed from the dish to which he %0awas about to help himself. Surely it was a disgrace for a man %0ato be governed by his own slave 1 more easily than by himself! %0a%0aCHAP. 15. (6.)-REMEDIES DEEIVED FBOM SNEEZING. %0a%0aSneezing, provoked by a feather, relieves heaviness in the %0ahead; it is said too, that to touch the nostrils of a mule with %0athe lips, will arrest sneezing and hiccup. For this last pur¬ %0apose, Yarro recommends us to scratch the palm, first of one %0ahand and then of the other; while many say that it is a good %0aplan to shift the ring from off the left hand to the longest finger %0aof the right, and then to plunge the hands into hot water. %0aTheophrastus says, that aged persons sneeze with greater diffi¬ %0aculty than others. %0a%0aCHAP. 16.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SEXUAL CONGRESS. %0a%0aDemocritus spoke in condemnation of the sexual congress, as® %0abeing merelyanact through which one human being springs from %0aanother; and really, by Hercules ! the more rarely it is used %0athe better. Still however, athletes, we find, when they become %0adull and heavy, are re-established by it: the voice, too, is re¬ %0astored by it, when from being perfectly clear, it has degenerated %0ainto hoarseness. The congress of the sexes is a cure also for %0apains in the loins, dimness of the eyesight, 9 alienation of the %0amental difficulties, and melancholy. %0a%0a6 “ Non prandentium.” %0a%0a1 Callisthenes the physician is the person supposed to be alluded to. %0aLucullus did not seem to be of opinion that a man “ must be a fool or a %0aphysician at forty.” %0a%0a8 “Ut in qua homo alius exsiliret ex homine.” _ The true meaning of %0athis it seems impossible, with certainty, to ascertain: though a more in¬ %0adelicate one than that given might be easily suggested. %0a%0a* On the contrary, some authorities say that it is apt to cause dimness of %0aright. %0a%0a%0a293 %0a%0a%0apliny's natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 17.-VARIOUS OTHER REMEDIES. %0a%0aTo sit by a pregnant woman, or by a person to whom any %0aremedy is being administered, with the fingers of one hand %0ainserted between those of the other, acts as a magic spell; a %0adiscovery that was made, it is said, when Alcmena 10 was %0adelivered of Hercules. If the fingers are thus joined, clasping %0aone or both knees, or if the ham of one leg is first put upon %0athe knee of the other, and then changed about, the omen is of %0astill worse signification. Hence it is, that in councils held by %0agenerals and persons in authority, our ancestors forbade these %0apostures, as being an impediment to all business. 11 They have %0agiven a similar prohibition also with reference to sacrifices and %0athe offering of public vows ; but as to the usage of uncovering %0athe head in presence of the magistrates, that has been enjoined, %0aYarro says, not as a mark of respect, but with a view to %0ahealth, the head being strengthened 12 by the practice of keeping %0ait uncovered. %0a%0aWhen anything has got into the eye, it is a good plan to %0aclose the other; and when water has got into the right ear, %0athe person should hop about on the left foot, with the head %0areclining upon the right shoulder, the reverse being done %0awhen the same has happened to the left ear. If the secretion %0aof the phlegm produces coughing, the best way of stopping it %0ais for another person to blow in the party’s face. When the %0auvula is relaxed, another person should take the patient with %0ahis teeth by the crown, 13 and lift him from the ground ; while %0afor pains in the neck, the hams should be rubbed, and for %0apains in the hams the neck. If a person is seized in bed with %0acramp in the sinews of the legs or thighs, he should set his %0afeet upon the ground: so, too, if he has cramp on the left %0aside, he should take hold of the great toe of the left foot with %0athe right hand, and if on the right side, the great toe of the %0aright foot with the left hand. For cold shiverings or for %0aexcessive bleeding at the nostrils, the extremities of the body %0ashould be well rubbed with sheep’s wool. To arrest inconti¬ %0anence of urine, the extremities of the generative organs should %0a%0a10 See Ovid, Met. ix. 273, et seq. %0a%0a11 Much more probably, because they were considered to be significant %0aof anything but seriousness and attention. %0a%0a12 Exemplified in the case of the Egyptians, Herodotus says. %0a%0a13 The remedy would seem to be worse than the evil. %0a%0a%0aChap. 18.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM TIIE TJRINE. 299 %0a%0abe tied with a thread of linen or papyrus, and a binding passed %0around the middle of the thigh. For derangement of the %0astomach, it is a good plan to press the feet together, or to %0aplunge the hands into hot water. %0a%0aIn addition to all this, in many cases it is found highly be¬ %0aneficial to speak but little; thus, for instance, Mtecenas Me- %0alissus, 11 we are told, enjoined silence on himself for three %0ayears, in consequence of spitting blood after a convulsive fit. %0aWhen a person is thrown from a carriage, or when, while %0amounting an elevation or lying extended at full length, he %0ais menaced with any accident, or if he receives a blow, it is %0asingularly beneficial to hold the breath ; a discovery for which %0awe are indebted to an animal, as already 15 stated. %0a%0aTo thrust an iron nail into the spot where a person’s head %0ala}' at the moment he was seized with a fit of epilepsy, is said %0ato have the effect of curing him of that disease. For pains in %0athe kidneys, loins, or bladder, it is considered highly soothing %0ato void the urine lying on the face at full length in a reclining %0abath. It is quite surprising how much more speedily wounds %0awill heal if they are bound up and tied with a Hercules’ knot : 16 %0aindeed, it is said, that if the girdle which we wear every day %0ais tied with a knot of this description, it will be productive of %0acertain beneficial effects, Hercules having been the first to %0adiscover the fact. %0a%0aDemetrius, in the treatise which he has compiled upon the %0anumber Four, alleges certain reasons why drink should never %0abe taken in proportions of four cyathi or sextarii. As a pre¬ %0aventive of ophthalmia, it is a good plan to rub the parts be¬ %0ahind the ears, and, as a cure for watery eyes, to rub the fore¬ %0ahead. As to the presages which are derived from man him¬ %0aself, there is one to the effect that so long as a person is able %0ato see himself reflected in the pupil of the patient’s eye, %0athere need be no apprehension of a fatal termination to the %0amalady. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE URINE. %0a%0aThe urine, 17 too, has been the subject not only of numerous %0a%0a14 See end of B. vii. 15 In B. viii. c. 58. %0a%0a16 A knot tied very hard, and in which no ends were to be seen. %0a%0a17 This excretion was, till lately, thought of great importance, as in¬ %0adicative of the health of the patient. %0a%0a%0a300 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. [Book XXVIII %0a%0a%0atheories with authors, but of various religious observances as %0awell, its properties being classified under several distinctive %0aheads: thus, for instance, the urine of eunuchs, they say, is %0ahighly beneficial as a promoter of fruitfulness in females. But %0ato turn to those remedies which we may he allowed to name %0awithout impropriety—the urine of children who have not %0aarrived at puberty is a sovereign remedy for the poisonous %0asecretions of the asp known as the “ ptyas,” 18 from the fact %0athat it spits its venom into the eyes of human beings. It is %0agood, too, for the cure of albugo, films and marks upon the %0aeyes, white specks 19 upon the pupils, and maladies of the eye¬ %0alids. In combination with meal of fitches, it is used for the %0acure of burns, and, with a head of bulbed leek, it is boiled %0adown to one half, in a new earthen vessel, for the treatment of %0asuppurations of the ears, or the extermination of worms breed¬ %0aing in those organs : the vapour, too, of this decoction acts as %0aan emmenagogue. Salpe recommends that the eyes should %0abe fomented with it, as a means of strengthening the sight; %0aand that it should be used as a liniment for sun scorches, %0ain combination with white of egg, that of the ostrich being %0athe most effectual, the application being kept on for a couple %0aof hours. %0a%0aUrine is also used for taking out ink spots. Male urine %0acures gout, witness the fullers for instance, 20 who, for this %0areason, it is said, are never troubled with that disease. With %0astale urine some mix ashes of calcined oyster-shells, for the %0acure of eruptions on the bodies of infants, and all kinds of %0arunning ulcers: it is used, too, as a liniment for corrosive sores, %0aburns, diseases of the rectum, chaps upon the body, and stings %0ainflicted by scorpions. The most celebrated midwives have %0apronounced that there is no lotion which removes itching sen¬ %0asations more effectually; and, with the addition of nitre, 21 they %0aprescribe it for the cure of ulcers of the head, porrigo, and %0acancerous sores, those of the generative organs in particular. %0aBut the fact is, and there is no impropriety in saying so, that %0aevery person’s own urine is the best for his own case, due %0a%0a18 From the Greek irrvut, “ to spit.” %0a%0ais « Argema.” %0a%0a30 Who had to use lant, or stale urine, in their business. %0a%0a21 At a future period we shall have to discuss the identity of the %0a“nitrum ” of Pliny.

Kneaded %0aup with ashes, it is good for the bite of a mad dog, and for the %0acure of stings inflicted by serpents. As to the bite of the %0ascolopendra, the effects of urine are said to be quite mar¬ %0avellous—the person who has been injured has only to touch %0athe crown of his head with a drop of his own urine, and he %0awill experience an instantaneous cure. %0a%0aCHAP. 19.—INDICATIONS OF HEALTH DERIVED FROM THE URINE. %0a%0aCertain indications of the health are furnished by the urine. %0aThus, for example, if it is white at first in the morning and %0aafterwards high-coloured, the first signifies that the digestion is %0agoing on, the last that it is completed. When the urine is red, %0ait is a bad sign; but when it is swarthy, it is the worst sign %0aof all. So, too, when it is thick or full of bubbles, it is a bad %0asign; and when a white sediment forms, it is a symptom of %0apains in the region of the viscera or in the joints. A green- %0acoloured urine is indicative of disease of the viscera, a pale urine %0aof biliousness, and a red urine of some distemper in the blood. %0aThe urine is in a bad state, too, when certain objects form in %0ait, like bran or fine clouds in appearance. A thin, white, urine %0aalso is in a diseased state ; but when it is thick and possessed %0aof an offensive smell, it is significant of approaching death : so, %0atoo, when with children it is thin and watery. %0a%0aThe adepts in magic expressly forbid a person, when about %0ato make water, to uncover the body in the face of the sun 22 or %0amoon, or to sprinkle with his urine the shadow of any object %0awhatsoever. Hesiod 23 gives a precept, recommending persons to %0amake water against an object standing full before them, that no %0adivinity may be offended by their nakedness being uncovered. %0aOsthanes maintains that every one who drops some urine %0aupon his foot in the morning will be proof against all noxious %0amedicaments. %0a%0aCHAP. 20.

The smell of a %0awoman’s hair, burnt, will drive away serpents, and hysterical %0asuffocations, it is said, may be dispelled thereby. The ashes %0aof a woman’s hair, burnt in an earthen vessel, or used in %0acombination with litharge, will cure eruptions and prurigo of %0athe eyes: used in combination with honey they will remove %0awarts and ulcers upon infants ; with the addition of honey and %0afrankincense, they will heal wounds upon the head, and fill up %0aall concavities left by corrosive ulcers; used with hogs’ lard, %0athey will cure inflammatory tumours and gout; and applied topi¬ %0acally to the part affected, they will arrest erysipelas and hae¬ %0amorrhage, and remove itching pimples on the body which %0aresemble the stings of ants. %0a%0aCHAP. 21. —REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOMAN’S MILK. %0a%0aAs to the uses to which woman’s milk has been applied, it %0ais generally agreed that it is the sweetest and the most deli¬ %0acate of all, and that it is the best 25 of remedies for chronic %0afevers and coeliac affections, when the woman has just weaned %0aher infant more particularly. In cases, too, of sickness at %0astomach, fevers, and gnawing sensations, it has been found by %0aexperience to be highly beneficial; as also, in combination %0awith frankincense, for abscesses of the mamill®. When the %0aeyes are bloodshot from the effects of a blow, or affected with %0apain or defluxion, it is a very good plan to inject woman’s milk %0ainto them, more particularly in combination with honey and %0ajuice of daffodil, or else powdered frankincense. In all cases, %0ahowever, the milk of a woman who has been delivered of a %0amale child is the most efficacious, and still more so if she has %0ahad male twins; provided always she abstains from wine and %0afood of an acrid nature. Mixed with the white of an egg in %0aa liquid state, and applied to the forehead in wool, it arrests %0a%0a21 The use o.f the word “ prodidere ” shows that treatises had been %0awritten on these abominable subjects.

See c. 23, and the %0aend of this Book. %0a%0a25 There is probably no foundation for this assertion. %0a%0a%0aChap. 21.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOMAN'S MILK. 303 %0a%0adefluxions of the eyes. If a frog 26 has spirted its secretions 27 %0ainto the eye, woman’s milk is a most excellent remedy ; and %0afor the bite of that reptile it is used both internally and ex¬ %0aternally. %0a%0aIt is asserted that if a person is rubbed at the same moment %0awith the milk of both mother and daughter, he will be proof %0afor the rest of his life against all affections of the eyes. %0aMixed with a small quantity of oil, woman’s milk is a cure for %0adiseases of the ears; and if they are in pain from the effects %0aof a blow, it is applied warm with goose-grease. If the ears %0aemit an offensive smell, a thing that is mostly the case in %0adiseases of long standing, wool is introduced into those organs, %0asteeped in woman’s milk and honey. While symptoms of %0ajaundice are still visible in the eyes, woman’s milk is injected, %0ain combination with elaterium. 28 Taken as a drink, it is pro¬ %0aductive of singularly good effects, where the poison of the %0asea-hare, the buprestis, 29 or, as Aristotle tells us, the plant %0adorycniunr 10 has been administered ; as a preventive also of the %0amadness produced by taking henbane. Woman’s milk also, %0amixed with hemlock, is recommended as a liniment for gout; %0awhile some there are who employ it for that purpose in com¬ %0abination with wool-grease 31 or goose-grease ; a form in which %0ait is used as an application for pains in the uterus. Taken as %0aa drink, it arrests diarrhoea, llabirius 32 says, and acts as an %0aemmenagogue; but where the woman has been delivered of a %0afemale child, her milk is of use only for the cure of face %0adiseases. %0a%0aWoman’s milk is also a cure for affections of the lungs ; and, %0amixed with the urine of a youth who has not arrived at pu¬ %0aberty, and Attic honey, in the proportion of one spoonful %0aof each, it removes singing in the ears, I find. Dogs which %0ahave once tasted the milk of a woman who has been delivered %0aof a male child, will never become mad, they say. %0a%0a26 “Rana.” He means the “ rubeta” probably, or “bramble-frog,” %0aso often mentioned by him.

For, in the first %0aplace, hailstorms, they say, whirlwinds, and lightning 31 even, %0awill be scared away by a woman uncovering her body while %0aher monthly courses are upon her. The same, too, with all %0aother kinds of tempestuous weather; and out at sea, a storm %0amay be lulled by a woman uncovering her body merely, even %0athough not menstruating at the time. As to the menstrual %0adischarge itself, a thing that in other respects, as 35 already %0astated on a more appropriate occasion, is productive of the most %0amonstrous effects, there are some ravings about it of a most %0adreadful and unutterable nature. Of these particulars, how¬ %0aever, I do not feel so much shocked at mentioning the follow¬ %0aing. If the menstrual discharge coincides with an eclipse of %0athe moon or sun, the evils resulting from it are irremediable; %0aand no less so, when it happens while the moon is in conjunc¬ %0ation with the sun ; the congress with a woman at such a period %0abeing noxious, and attended with fatal effects to the man. At %0athis period also, the lustre of purple is tarnished by the touch %0aof a woman : so much more baneful is her influence at this %0atime than at any other. At any other time, also, if a woman %0astrips herself naked while she is menstruating, and walks %0around a field of wheat, the caterpillars, worms, beetles, and %0aother vermin, will fall from off the ears of corn. Metrodorus %0aof Scepsos tells us that this discovery was first made in Cappa¬ %0adocia ; and that, in consequence of such multitudes of can- %0a%0a83 “ Fascia.” Either a stomacher, or a fillet for the head. %0a%0a34 The mention of lightning here, Hardouin seems to look upon as an %0ainterpolation. 35 In B. vii. c. 13. %0a%0a%0aTHE MENSTRUAL DISCHARGE. %0a%0a%0a305 %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] %0a%0atharides being found to breed there, it is the practice for %0awomen to walk through the middle of the fields with their %0agarments tucked up above the thighs. 36 In other places, again, %0ait is the usage for women to go barefoot, with the hair %0adishevelled and the girdle loose : due precaution must be taken, %0ahowever, that this is not done at sun-rise, for if so, the crop %0awill wither and dry up. Young vines, too, it is said, are in¬ %0ajured irremediably by the touch of a woman in this state ; and %0aboth rue and ivy, plants possessed of highly medicinal virtues, %0awill die instantly upon being touched by her. %0a%0aMuch as I have already stated on the. virulent effects of this %0adischarge, I have to state, in addition, that bees, it is a well- %0aknown fact, will forsake their hives if touched by a menstruous %0awoman; that linen boiling in the cauldron will turn black, that %0athe edge of a razor will become blunted, and that copper ves¬ %0asels will contract a fetid smell and become covered with verdi- %0agrease, on coming in contact with her. A mare big with foal, %0ait' touched by a woman in this state, will be sure to miscarry; %0anay, even more than this, at the very sight of a woman, %0athough seen at a distance even, should she happen to be %0amenstruating for the first time after the loss of her virginity, %0aor for the first time, while in a state of virginity. The bitu¬ %0amen 37 that is found in Judaea, will yield to nothing but the %0amenstrual discharge ; its tenacity being overcome, as already %0astated, by the agency of a tliread from a garment which has %0abeen brought in contact with this fluid. Tire itself even, an %0aelement which triumphs over every other substance, is unable %0ato conquer this; for if reduced to ashes and then sprinkled %0aupon garments when about to be scoured, it will change their %0apurple tint, and tarnish the brightness of the colours. Indeed %0aso pernicious are its properties, that women themselves, the %0asource from which it is derived, are far from being proof against %0aits effects; a pregnant woman, for instance, if touched with %0ait, or indeed if she so much as steps over it, will be liable to %0amiscarry. %0a%0aLais and Elepliantis 38 have given statements quite at va¬ %0ariance, on the subject of abortives ; they mention the efficacy %0a%0a36 Columella describes this practice in verse, in B. x., and in B. xi. c. 3* %0aJSlian also mentions it. %0a%0a37 See B. vii. c. 13.

Bithus of Dyrrha- %0achium informs us that a mirror, 39 which has been tarnished by %0athe gaze of a menstruous female, will recover its brightness if %0athe same woman looks steadily upon the back of it; he states, %0aalso, that all evil influences of this nature will be entirely %0aneutralized, if the woman carries the fish known as the sur %0amullet about her person. %0a%0aOn the other hand, again, many writers say that, baneful as %0ait is, there are certain remedial properties in this fluid; that it %0ais a good plan, for instance, to use it as a topical application for %0agout, and that women, while menstruating, can give relief by %0atouching scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotid %0aglands, inflamed tumours, erysipelas, boils, and defluxions of %0athe eyes. According to La'is and Salpe, the bite of a mad dog, %0aas well as tertian or quartan fevers, may be cured by putting %0asome menstruous blood in the wool of a black ram and enclo¬ %0asing it in a silver bracelet; and we learn from Diotirnus of %0aThebes that the smallest portion will suffice of any kind of %0acloth that has been stained therewith, a thread even, if in¬ %0aserted and worn in a bracelet. The midwife Sotira informs %0aus that the most efficient cure for tertian and quartan fevers is %0ato rub the soles of the patient’s feet therewith, the result being %0a,still more successful if the operation is performed by the woman %0aherself, without the patient being aware of it; she says, too, %0athat this is an excellent method for reviving persons when %0aattacked with epilepsy. %0a%0aIcetidas the physician pledges his word that quartan fever %0amay be cured by sexual intercourse, provided the woman is %0ajust beginning to menstruate. It is universally agreed, too, that %0awhen a person has been bitten by a dog and manifests a dread %0aof water and of all kinds of drink, it will be quite sufficient %0ato put under his cup a strip of cloth that has been dipped in %0a- 39 See B. vii. c. 13. %0a%0a%0aChap. 24.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ELEPHANT. 30/ %0a%0athis fluid; the result being that the hydrophobia will immedi¬ %0aately disappear. This arises, no doubt, from that powerful %0asympathy which has been so much spoken of by the Greeks, %0aand the existence of which is proved by the fact, 40 already men¬ %0ationed, that dogs become mad upon tasting this fluid. It is a well- %0aknown fact, too, that the menstruous discharge, reduced to ashes, %0aand applied with furnace soot and wax, is a cure for ulcers upon %0aall kinds of beasts of burden; and that stains made upon a gar¬ %0ament with it can only be removed by the agency of the urine %0aof the same female. Equally certain it is, too, that this fluid, re¬ %0aduced to ashes and mixed with oil of roses, is very useful, applied %0ato the forehead, for allaying head-ache, in women more parti¬ %0acularly , as also that the nature of the discharge is most viru¬ %0alent in females whose virginity has been destroyed solely by %0athe lapse of time. %0a%0aAnother thing universally acknowledged and one which I %0aam ready to believe with the greatest pleasure, is the fact, that %0aif the door-posts are only touched with the menstruous fluid %0aall spells of the magicians will be neutralized—a set of men %0athe most lying in existence, as any one may ascertain. I will %0agive an example of one of the most reasonable of their pre¬ %0ascriptions lake the parings of the toe-nails and finger-nails %0aof a sick person, and mix them up with wax, the party saying %0athat he is seeking a remedy for a tertian, quartan, or quotidian %0afever, as the case may be; then stick this wax, before sunrise, %0aupon the door of another person—such is the prescription they %0agive for these diseases! What deceitful persons they must be %0aif there is no truth in it! And how highly criminal, if they %0areally do thus transfer diseases from one person to another! %0aSome of them, again, whose practices are of a less guilty %0anature, recommend that the parings of all the finger-nails %0ashould be thrown at the entrance of ant-holes, the first ant to be %0ataken which attempts to draw one into the hole; this, they say, %0amust be attached to the neck of the patient, and he will ex¬ %0aperience a speedy cure. %0a%0aCHiP. 24. (8.)-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM FOREIGN ANIMALS: %0a%0aTHE ELEPHANT, EIGHT REMEDIES. %0a%0aSuch then are the remedies from human beings which may %0awith any degree of propriety be described, and many of those %0aonly with the leave and good-will of the reader. The rest are %0a40 See B. vii. c. 13. x 9 %0a%0a%0aSOS %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural histort. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aof a most execrable and infamous nature, such, in fact, as to %0amake me hasten to close my description of the remedies de¬ %0arived from man : we yvill therefore proceed to speak of the more %0aremarkable animals, and the effects produced by them. The %0ablood of the elephant, the male in particular, arrests all those %0adefluxions known by the name of “ rheumatismi.” Ivory %0ashavings, it is said, in combination with Attic honey, are good %0afor the removal of spots upon the face : with the sawdust, too, %0aof ivory, hangnails are removed. By the touch of an elephant’s %0atrunk head-ache is alleviated, if the animal happens to sneeze %0aat the time more particularly. The right side of the trunk, %0aattached to the body with red earth of Lemnos, acts powerfully %0aas an aphrodisiac. Elephant’s blood is good for consumption, %0aand the liver for epilepsy. %0a%0aCHAP. 25.-TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE LION. %0a%0aLion’s fat, mixed with oil of roses, protects the skin of the %0aface from all kinds of spots, and preserves the whiteness of the %0acomplexion; it is remedial also for such parts of the body as %0ahave been frozen by snow, and for swellings in the joints. The %0afrivolous lies of the magicians assert that persons who are %0aanointed with lion’s fat, will more readily win favour with %0akings and peoples; more particularly when the fat has been %0aused that lies between the eyebrows of the animal—a place, in %0afact, where there is no fat to be found ! The like effects they %0apromise also from the possession of a lion’s tooth, one from the %0aright side in particular, as also the shaggy hairs that are %0afound upon the lower jaw. The gall, used as an ointment in %0acombination with water, improves the eyesight, and, employed %0awith the fat of the same animal, is a cure for epilepsy ; but %0aa slight taste only must be taken of it, and the patient must %0arun immediately after swallowing it, in order to digest it. A %0alion’s heart, used as food, is curative of quartan fevers, and %0athe fat, taken with oil of roses, of quotidian fevers. Wild %0abeasts will fly from persons anointed with lion’s fat, and it is %0athought to be a preservative even against treacherous practices. %0a%0aCHAP. 26.-TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CAMEL. %0a%0aA camel’s 41 brains, dried and taken in vinegar, are a cure, they %0a%0a41 Pliny has omitted the milk of the camel, which, according to Taver¬ %0anier, is an excellent cure for dropsy. %0a%0a%0aChap. 27.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HYJ2NA. 309 %0a%0asay, for epilepsy: the same, too, with the gall, taken with %0ahoney ; which is a remedy also for quinzy. A camel’s tail %0adried, it is said, is productive of diarrhoea, and ashes of burnt %0acamel’s dung, mixed with oil, make the hair curl. These %0aashes, applied topically, are very useful for dysentery, as also %0ataken in drink, the proper dose being a pinch in three fingers %0aat a time ; they are curative also of epilepsy. Camel’s urine %0ait is said, is very useful to fullers, and is good for the cure of %0arunning sores. Barbarous nations, we are told, are in the habit %0aof keeping it till it is five years old, and then taking it as a %0apurgative, in doses of one semisextarius. The hairs of the %0atail, it is said, plaited and attached to the left arm, are a cure %0afor quartan fevers. %0a%0aCHAP. 27.—SEVENTY-NINE EEMED1ES DEEIVED FROM THE HYASNA. %0a%0aBut of all animals, it is the hyaena that has been held in %0athe highest admiration by the magicians, who have gone so %0afar as to attribute to it certain magical virtues even, and the %0apower of alluring 42 human beings and depriving them of their %0asenses. Of its change of sex each year, and other monstrous %0apeculiarities 43 in its nature, we have spoken already ; 44 we %0awill now proceed to describe the medicinal virtues that are %0aascribed to it. %0a%0aThe hyaena, it is said, is particularly terrible to panthers; so %0amuch so, indeed, that they will not attempt to make the slight¬ %0aest resistance to it, and will never attack a man who has any %0aportion of a hyaena’s skin about him. A thing truly marvel¬ %0alous to tell of, if the hides of these two animals are hung up %0afacing one another, the hair will fall from off 1 the panther’s skin! %0a"When the hyaena flies before the hunter, it turns off on the %0aright, and letting the man get before it, follows in his track ; %0ashould it succeed in doing which, the man is sure to lose his %0asenses and fall from his horse even. But if, on the other hand, %0ait turns off to the left, it is a sign that the animal is losing %0astrength, and that it will soon be taken. The easiest method, %0ahowever, of taking it, they say, is for the hunter to tie his %0agirdle with seven knots, and to make as many knots in the %0a%0a42 See B. viii. c. 44. %0a%0a42 One peculiarity not mentioned by Pliny, is, that its skin, like that of %0athe sea-calf, was said to be proof against the effects of lightning. %0a%0a44 In B. viii. c. 44. %0a%0a%0a3)0 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0awhip with which he guides his horse. In addition to all this, %0aso full of quirks and subtleties are the vain conceits of the %0amagicians, they recommend the hyaena to be captured while %0athe moon is passing through the sign of Gemini, and every %0ahair of it to be preserved, if possible. They say, too, that the %0askin of the head is highly efficacious, if attached to a person %0asuffering from head-ache; that the gall, applied to the fore¬ %0ahead, is curative of ophthalmia; and that if the gall is boiled %0adown with three cyathi of Attic honey and one ounce of saffron, %0ait will be a most effectual preservative against that disease, %0athe same preparation being equally good for the dispersion of %0afilms on the eyes and cataract. If, again, this preparation is %0akept till it is old, it will be all the better for improving the %0asight, due care being taken to preserve it in a box of Cyprian %0acopper : they assert also, that it is good for the cure of argema, %0aeruptions and excrescences of the eyes, and marks upon those %0aorgans. For diseases 45 of the crystalline humours of the eyes, %0ait is recommended to anoint them with the gravy of hyaena’s %0aliver roasted fresh, incorporated with clarified honey. %0a%0aWe learn also, from the same sources, that the teeth of the %0ahyaena are useful for the cure of tooth-ache, the diseased tooth %0abeing either touched with them, or the animal’s teeth being %0aarranged in their regular order, and attached to the patient; %0athat the shoulders of this animal are good for the cure of pains %0ain the arms and shoulders ; that the teeth, extracted from the %0aleft side of the jaw, and wrapped in the skin of a sheep or he- %0agoat, are an effectual cure for pains in the stomach; that the %0alights of the animal, taken with the food, are good for cceliac %0aaffections; that the lights, reduced to ashes and applied with oil, %0aare also soothing to the stomach; that the marrow of the back¬ %0abone, used with old oil and gall, is strengthening to the sinews; %0athat the liver, tasted thrice just before the paroxysms, is good %0afor quartan fevers ; that the ashes of the vertebrae, applied in %0ahyaena’s skin with the tongue and right foot of a sea-calf and a %0abull’s gall, the whole boiled up together, are soothing for gout; %0athat for the same disease hyaena’s gall is advantageously em¬ %0aployed in combination with stone of Assos; 46 that for cold shiver- %0aings, spasms, sudden fits of starting, and palpitations of the %0a%0a45 “ Glaucomata.” Littre considers, on the authority of M. Sichel, that %0a“ Glaucoma ” and “ suffusio ” are different names for the same disease- %0acataract. « See B. xxxvi. c. 27. %0a%0a%0aChap. 27 .] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM THE HTJENA. 311 %0a%0aheart, it is a good plan to eat some portion of a hysena’s heart %0acooked, care being taken to reduce the rest to ashes, and to %0aapply it with the brains of the animal to the part affected; %0athat this last composition, or the gall applied alone, acts as %0aa depilatory, the hairs being first plucked out which are %0awanted not to grow again; that by this method superfluous hairs %0aof the eyelids may be removed; that the flesh of the loins, %0aeaten and applied with oil, is a cure for pains in the loins; and %0athat sterility in females may be removed by giving them the %0aeye of this animal to eat, in combination with liquorice and dill, %0aconception within three days being warranted as the result. %0a%0aPersons afflicted with night-mare and dread of spectres, will %0aexperience relief, they say, b) r attaching one of the large teeth %0aof a hyaena to the body, with a linen thread. In fits of delirium %0atoo, it is recommended to fumigate the patient with the smoke %0aof one of these teeth, and to attach one in front of his chest, %0awith the fat of the kidneys, or else the liver or skin. They %0aassert also that a pregnant woman will never miscarry, if she %0awears suspended from her neck, the white flesh from a hyaena’s %0abreast, with seven hairs and the genitals of a stag, the whole %0atied up in the skin of a gazelle. The genitals, they say, eaten %0awith honey, act as a stimulant upon a person, according to %0athe sex, and this even though it should be the case of a man %0awho has manifested an aversion to all intercourse with females. %0a%0aNay, even more than all this, we are assured that if the %0agenitals and a certain joint of the vertebrae are preserved in %0aa house with the hide adhering to them, they will ensure peace %0aand concord between all members of the family ; hence it is %0athat this part is known as the “joint of the spine ,” 47 or “ At- %0alantian 48 knot.” This joint, which is the first, is reckoned among %0athe remedies for epilepsy. %0a%0aThe fumes of the burnt fat of this animal will put ser¬ %0apents to flight, they say; and the jawbone, pounded with anise %0aand taken with the food, is a cure for shivering fits. A fumi¬ %0agation made therewith has the effect of an emmenagogue ; and %0asuch are the frivolous and absurd conceits of the professors of %0athe magic art, that they boldly assert that if a man attaches to %0a%0a4 ' “ Spinae ” seems a preferable reading to “ ruinge,” adopted by Sillig. %0a%0a48 “ Nodum Atlantion.” From the Greek drKag, “ much enduring,” %0aJulius Pollux says, because it was fitted for supporting burdens.

Bogs, they say, will never %0abark at persons who have a hyaena’s tongue in the shoe, %0abeneath the sole of the foot. The left side of the brain, applied %0ato the nostrils, is said to have a soothing effect upon all %0adangerous maladies either in men or beasts. They say, too, that %0athe skin of the forehead is a preservative against all fascina¬ %0ations ; that the flesh of the neck, whether eaten or dried and %0ataken in drink, is good for pains in the loins; that the sinews %0aof the back and shoulders, used as a fumigation, are good for %0apains in the sinews; that the bristles of the snout, applied to %0aa woman’s lips, have all the effect of a philtre; and that the %0aliver, administered in drink, is curative of griping pains and %0aurinary calculi. %0a%0aThe heart, it is said, taken with the food or drink, is remedial %0afor all kinds of pains in the body; the milt for pains in the %0aspleen; the caul, in combination with oil, for inflammatory ul¬ %0acers ; and the marrow for pains in the spine and weakness in the %0asinews. The strings of the kidneys, they say, if taken with %0awine and frankincense, will restore fruitfulness, in cases where %0ait has been banished through the agency of noxious 6pells; the %0auterus, taken in drink with the rind of a sweet pomegranate, %0ais highly beneficial for diseases of the uterus ; and the fat of %0athe loins, used as a fumigation, removes all impediments to %0adelivery, and accelerates parturition. The marrow of the back, %0aattached to the body as an amulet, is an effectual remedy for %0afantastic illusions, 60 and the genitals of the male animal, used %0aas a fumigation, are good for the cure of spasms. For oph¬ %0athalmia, ruptures, and inflammations, the feet, which are kept %0afor the purpose, are touched; the left feet for affections on the %0aright side of the body, and the right feet for affections on the %0aleft. The left foot, if laid upon the body of a woman in travail, %0awill be productive, they say, of fatal effects; but the right foot, %0asimilarly employed, will facilitate delivery. The vesicle %0awhich has contained the gall, taken in wine or with the food, is %0a%0a49 We shall have occasion to make enquiry as to the identity of the %0a“ alumen” of Pliny on a future occasion. %0a%0a50 “ Vanas species.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 27 ] BEilEDJES DERIVED FBOM THE HT^HA. 313 %0a%0a%0abeneficial for the cardiac disease; and the bladder, taken in %0awine, is a good preservative against incontinence of urine. %0aThe urine, too, which is found in the bladder, taken with oil, %0asesame, and honey, is said to be useful for diseases of long %0astanding. %0a%0aThe first rib and the eighth, used as a fumigation, are said %0ato he useful for ruptures ; the vertebrae for women in travail; %0aand the blood, in combination with polenta, 51 for griping pains %0ain the bowels. If the door-posts are touched with this blood, %0athe various arts of the magicians will be rendered of no effect; %0athey will neither be able to summon the gods into their pre¬ %0asence nor to converse with them, whatever the method to which %0athey have recourse, whether lamps or basin, water or globe, 52 %0aor any other method. %0a%0aThe flesh of the hyaena, taken as food, is said to be efficacious %0afor the bite of a mad dog, and the liver still more so. The %0aflesh or bones of a human being which have been found in the %0abelly of a slain hyaena, used as a fumigation, are said to be %0aremedial for gout: but if among these remains the nails are %0afound, it is looked upon as a presage of death to some one among %0athose who have captured it. The excrements or bones which %0ahave been voided by the animal at the moment when killed, %0aare looked upon as counter-charms to magic spells. The dung %0afound in the intestines is dried and administered in drink fox- %0adysentery ; and it is applied to all parts of the body with %0agoose-grease, in the form of a liniment, in the case of persons %0awho have received injury from some noxious medicament. By %0arubbing themselves with the grease, and lying upon the skin, %0aof a hyeena, persons who have been bitten by dogs are cured. %0a%0aOn the other hand, the ashes of the left pastern-bone, they %0ajay, boiled with weasel’s blood, and applied to a person’s body, %0awill ensure universal hatred; a similar effect being equally %0aproduced by the eye when boiled. But the most extraordinary %0athing of all is, their assertion that the extremity of the rectum %0aof this animal is a preservative against all oppression on the %0apart of chiefs and potentates, and an assurance of success in all %0apetitions, judgments, and lawsuits, and this, if a person only %0acarries it about him. The anus, according to them, has so %0apowerful an effect as a philtre, that if it is worn on the left %0aarm, a woman will be sure to follow the wearer the moment %0a51 See B. xviii. c. 14. Si “ Pila.” %0a%0a%0a314 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0ahe looks at her. The hairs, too, of this part, reduced to ashes, %0aand applied with oil to the body of a man who is living a life %0aof disgraceful effeminacy, will render him not only modest, %0athey assure us, but of scrupulous morals even. %0a%0aCHAP. 28.- NINETEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CROCODILE. %0a%0aFor fabulous stories connected with it the crocodile may %0achallenge the next place ; and, indeed for cunning, the one 55 %0awhich lives both upon land and in the water is fully its equal: %0afor I would here remark, that there are two varieties of this %0aanimal. The teeth of the right jaw of the amphibious croco¬ %0adile, attached to the right arm as an amulet, acts as an aphro¬ %0adisiac, that is, if we choose to believe it. The eye-teeth of %0athe animal, filled with frankincense—for they are hollow—are %0aa cure for periodical fevers, care being taken to let the patient %0aremain five days without seeing the person who has attached %0athem to his body. A similar virtue is attributed to the small %0astones which are found in the belly of this animal, as being a %0acheck to the cold shiverings in fevers, when about to come on; %0aand with the same object the ^Egyptians are in the habit of %0aanointing their sick with the fat of the crocodile. %0a%0aThe other kind of crocodile 54 resembles it, but is much in¬ %0aferior in size: it lives upon land only, and among the most %0aodoriferous flowers ; hence it is that its intestines are so greatly %0ain request, being filled as they are with a mass of agreeable %0aperfumes. This substance is called “ crocodilea,” and it is %0alooked upon as extremely beneficial for diseases of the eyes, %0aand for the treatment of films and cataract, being applied with %0aleek-juice in the form of an ointment. Applied with oil of %0aCyprus, 55 it removes blemishes growing upon the face; and, em¬ %0aployed with water, it is a cure for all those diseases, the %0anature of which it is to spread upon the face, while at the same %0atime it restores the natural tints of the skin. An application %0aof it makes freckles disappear, as well as all kinds of spots and %0a%0a53 Identified by Ajasson with the chatmes, or common crocodile of the %0aNile. %0a%0a54 See B. viii. c. 38. Identified by Ajasson with the souchos of Geoffroy %0aSaint-Hilaire. It is equally amphibious with the other ; and the account %0aof its habits given by Pliny is probably founded on the fact that Upper %0aEgypt, which it inhabits, is covered with a more aromatic vegetation than %0athe other parts of that country. %0a%0a65 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%0a%0aChap. 29.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CHAMELEON. 315 %0a%0apimples; and it is taken for epilepsy, in doses of two oboli, in %0aoxymel. Used in the form of a pessary it acts as an emmena- %0agogue. The best kind of crocodilea, is that which is the whitest, %0afriable, and the lightest in weight: when rubbed between the %0afingers it should ferment like leaven. The usual method is %0ato wash it, as they do white lead. It is sometimes adulterated %0awith amylum 86 or with Cimolian earth, but the most common %0amethod of sophistication is to catch the crocodiles and feed %0athem upon nothing but rice. It is recommended as one of %0athe most efficient remedies for cataract to anoint the eyes with %0acrocodile’s gall, incorporated with honey. We are assured %0aalso that it is highly beneficial for affections of the uterus to %0amake fumigations with the intestines and rest of the body, or %0aelse to envelope the patient with wool impregnated with the %0asmoke. %0a%0aThe ashes of the skin of either crocodile, applied with vinegar %0ato such parts of the body as are about to undergo an incision, %0aor indeed the very smell of the skin when burning, will render %0athe patient insensible to the knife. The blood of either croco¬ %0adile, applied to the eyes, effaces marks upon those organs and %0aimproves the sight. The body, with the exception of the head %0aand feet, is eaten, boiled, for the cure of sciatica, and is found %0avery useful for chronic coughs, in children more particularly : %0ait is equally good, too, for the cure of lumbago. These animals %0ahave a certain fat also, which, applied to the hair, makes it fall %0aoff; persons anointed with this fat are effectually protected %0aagainst crocodiles, and it is the practice to drop it into wounds %0ainflicted by them. A crocodile’s heart, attached to the body %0ain the wool of a black sheep without a speck of any other %0acolour, due care too being taken that the sheep was the first %0alamb yeaned by its dam, will effectually cure a quartan fever, %0ait is said. %0a%0aCHAP. 29. —FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CHAMELEON. %0a%0aTo these animals we shall annex some others that are equally %0aforeign, and very similar in their properties. To begin then %0awith the chamseleon, which Democritus has considered worthy %0ato be made the subject of an especial work, and each part of %0awhich has been consecrated to some particular purpose—This %0abook, in fact, has afforded me no small amusement, revealing %0a56 See B. xviii. c. 17. %0a%0a%0a316 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aas it does, and exposing the lies and frivolities of the Greeks.— %0aIn size, the chamseleon resembles the crocodile last mentioned, %0aand only differs from it in having the back-bone arched at u %0amore acute angle, and a larger tail. There is no animal, it is %0athought, more 57 timid than this, a fact to which it owes its %0arepeated changes of colour. 58 It has a peculiar ascendancy over %0athe hawk tribe; for, according to report, it has the power of %0aattracting those birds, when flying above it, and then leaving %0athem a voluntary prey for other animals. Democritus 89 asserts %0athat if the head and neck of a chamaeleon are burnt in a %0afire made with logs of oak, it will be productive of a storm %0aattended with rain and thunder ; a result equally produced by %0aburning the liver upon the tiles of a house. As to the rest of %0athe magical virtues which he ascribes to this animal, we shall %0aforbear to mention them, although we look upon them as un¬ %0afounded ; 60 except, indeed, in some few instances where their %0avery ridiculousness sufficiently refutes his assertions. %0a%0aThe right eye, he says, taken from the living animal and %0aapplied with goats’ milk, removes diseases of the crystalline %0ahumours of the eyes; and the tongue, attached to the body as %0aan amulet, is an effectual preservative against the perils of %0achild-birth. He asserts also that the animal itself will facilitate %0aparturition, if in the house at the moment; but if, on the %0aother hand, it is brought from elsewhere, the consequences, he %0asays, will be most dangerous. The tongue, he tells us, if taken %0afrom the animal alive, will ensure a favourable result to suits %0aat law; and the heart, attached to the body with black wool %0aof the first shearing, is a good preservative against the attacks %0aof quartan fever. %0a%0aHe states also that the right fore-paw, attached to the left %0aarm in the skin of the hyaena, is a most effectual preserva¬ %0ative against robberies and alarms at night; that the pap on %0athe right side is a preventive of fright and panics; that the %0aleft foot is sometimes burnt in a furnace with the plant which %0aalso has the name of “chamaeleon,” 61 and is then made up, with %0asome unguent, into lozenges; and that these lozenges, kept in %0a%0a57 It is a timid animal, but Pliny’s authorities have exaggerated its %0atimidity. %0a%0a58 This change of colour is in reality owing to change of locality. %0a%0a59 A.

As to the left shoulder of the chamseleon, I should %0abe quite ashamed to say to what monstrous purposes Democri¬ %0atus devotes it; how that dreams may be produced by the %0aagency thereof, and transferred to any person we may think %0aproper; how that these dreams may be dispelled by the em¬ %0aployment of the right foot; and how that lethargy, which has %0abeen produced by the right foot of this animal, may be removed %0aby .the agency of the left side. %0a%0aSo, too, head-ache, he tells us, may be cured by sprinkling %0awine upon the head, in which either flank of a chamseleon has %0abeen macerated. If the feet are rubbed with the ashes of the %0aleft thigh or foot, mixed with sow’s milk, gout, he says, will %0abe the result. It is pretty generally believed, however, that %0acataract and diseases of the crystalline humours of the eyes %0amay be cured by anointing those organs with the gall for three %0aconsecutive days ; that serpents may be put to flight by drop¬ %0aping some of it into the fire ; that weasels may be attracted by %0awater into which it has been thrown ; and that, applied to the %0abody, it acts as a depilatory. The liver, they say, applied with %0athe lungs of a bramble-frog, is productive of a similar effect: %0ain addition to which, we are told that the liver counteracts the %0aeffects of philtres; that persons are cured of melancholy by %0adrinking from the warm skin of a chamseleon the juice of %0athe plant known by that name; and that if the intestines of %0athe animal and their contents—we should bear in mind that %0ain reality the animal lives without food 62 —are mixed with %0aapes’ urine, and the doors of an enemy are besmeared with the %0amixture, he will, through its agency, become the object of %0auniversal hatred. %0a%0aWe are told, too, that by the agency of the tail, the %0acourse of rivers and torrents may be stopped, and serpents %0astruck with torpor; that the tail, prepared with cedar and %0amyrrh, and tied to a double branch of the date-palm, will %0adivide waters that are smitten therewith, and so disclose every- %0a%0a62 See B. viii. c. 61.

It is quite evident that this %0aphilosopher, a man who has shown himself so sagacious in %0aother respects, and so useful to his fellow-men, has been led %0aaway, in this instance, by too earnest a desire to promote the %0awelfare of mankind. %0a%0aCHAP. 30.-POUR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SCINCT8. %0a%0aSimilar in appearance to the preceding animals is the %0ascincus, 64 which by some writers has been called the land %0acrocodile ; it is, however, whiter in appearance, and the skin is %0anot so thick. But the main difference between it and the cro¬ %0acodile is in the arrangement of the scales, which run from the %0atail towards the head. The largest of these animals is the Indian %0ascincus, and next to it that of Arabia; they are brought here %0asalted. The muzzle and fat of the scincus, taken in white %0a•wine, act as an aphrodisiac; when used with satyrion 65 and %0arocket-seed more particularly, in the proportion of one drachma %0aof each, mixed with two drachmae of pepper; the ■whole being %0amade up into lozenges of one drachma each, and so taken in %0adrink. The flesh from the flanks, taken internally in a similar %0amanner, in doses of two oboli, with myrrh and pepper, is %0agenerally thought to be productive of a similar effect, and to %0abe even more efficacious for the purpose. According to Apelles, %0athe flesh of the scincus is good for wounds inflicted by poisoned %0aarrows, whether taken before or after the wound is inflicted: %0ait is used as an ingredient, also, in the most celebrated anti¬ %0adotes. Sextius tells us, that, taken in doses of more than one %0adrachma, in one semisextarius of wine, the flesh is productive of %0adeadly results: he adds, too, that a broth prepared from it, %0ataken with honey, acts as an antaphrodisiac. %0a%0aCHAP. 31.—SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HirPOPOTAMCS. %0a%0aBetween the crocodile, too, and the hippopotamus there is a %0acertain affinity, frequenting as they do the same river, and %0abeing both of them of an amphibious nature.

The skin of the left side of %0athe forehead, attached to the groin, acts as an antaphrodisiac; and %0aan application of the ashes of the same part will cause the hair %0ato grow when lost through alopecy. The testes are taken in %0awater, in doses of one drachma, for the cure of injuries inflicted %0aby serpents. The blood is made use of by painters. %0a%0aCHAP. 32.-FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE LYNX. %0a%0aTo foreign countries, also, belongs the lynx, which of all %0aquadrupeds is possessed of the most piercing sight. It is said %0athat in the Isle of Carpathus a most powerful medicament is %0aobtained by reducing to ashes the nails of the lynx, together %0awith the hide ; that these ashes, taken in drink, have the %0aeffect of checking abominable desires in men; and that, if they %0aare sprinkled upon women, all libidinous thoughts will be %0arestrained. They are good too for the removal of itching %0asensations in any part of the body. The urine of the lynx is %0aa remedy for strangury; for which reason the animal, it is %0asaid, is in the habit of rooting up the ground and covering it %0athe moment it is voided. 67 It is mentioned, too, that this urine %0ais an effectual remedy for pains in the throat. Thus much %0awith reference to foreign animals. %0a%0aCHAP. 33. (9.)-REMEDIES FURNISHED IN COMMON BY ANIMALS %0a%0aOF THE SAME CLASS, WHETHER WILD OR TAME. FIFTY-FOUR %0a%0aMEDICINAL USES OF MILK, WITH OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%0aWe will now return to our own part of the world, speaking, %0afirst of all, of certain remedies common to animals in general, %0abut excellent in their nature; such as the use of milk, for %0aexample. The most beneficial milk to every creature is the %0amother’s 66 milk. It is highly dangerous for nursing women to %0a%0a66 In B. viii. c. 40. 67 See B_. viii. e. 57. %0a%0a88 Except, of course, when the mother is in a state of disease. %0a%0a%0a320 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVI11. %0a%0a%0aconceive: children that are suckled by them are known among %0aus as “ colostrati,” 69 their milk being thick, like cheese in ap¬ %0apearance—the name “ colostra,” 70 it should be remembered, is %0agiven to the first milk secreted after delivery, which assumes a %0aspongy, coagulated form. The most nutritive milk, in all %0acases, is woman’s milk, and next to that goats’ milk, to which %0ais owing, probably, the fabulous story that Jupiter was suckled %0aby a goat. 71 The sweetest, next to woman’s milk, is camels’ %0amilk ; but the most efficacious, medicinally speaking, is asses’ %0amilk. It is in animals of the largest size and individuals %0aof the greatest bulk, that the milk is secreted with the greatest %0afacility. .Goats’ milk agrees the best with the stomach, that %0aanimal browsing more than grazing. Cows’ milk is considered %0amore medicinal, while ewes’ milk is sweeter and more nutri¬ %0ative,- but not so well adapted to the stomach, it being more %0aoleaginous than any other. %0a%0aEvery kind of milk is more aqueous in spring than in sum¬ %0amer, and the same in all cases where the animal has grazed %0aupon a new pasture. The best milk of all is that which adheres %0ato the finger nail, when placed there, and does not run from off %0ait. Milk is most harmless when boiled, more particularly if %0asea pebbles 73 have been boiled with it. Cows’ milk is the most %0arelaxing, and all kinds of milk are less apt to inflate when %0aboiled. Milk is used for all kinds of internal ulcerations, %0athose of the kidneys, bladder, intestines, throat, and lungs in %0aparticular ; and externally, it is employed for itching sensations %0aupon the skin, and for purulent eruptions, it being taken fasting %0afor the purpose. We have already 73 stated, when speaking of %0athe plants, how that in Arcadia cows’ milk is administered for %0aphthisis, consumption, and cachexy. Instances are cited, also, %0aof persons who have been cured of gout in the hands and feet, %0aby drinking asses’ milk. %0a%0aTo these various kinds of milk, medical men have added %0aanother, to which they have given the name of “ schiston;” 14 %0a%0a09 See B. xi. c. 96. Dalcchamps remarks that Pliny is in error here: %0athis name being properly given to infants which have been put to the breast %0atoo soon after child-birth. And so it would appear from the context. %0a%0a70 The “biestings.” 71 Amalthaea. %0a%0a72 Dioscorides says “river pebbles." 73 In B. xxv. c. 53. %0a%0a74 From the Greek ox inT '°“divided ” milk, or “curds.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 33.] %0a%0a%0aMEDICINAL USES OF MILK. %0a%0a%0a321 %0a%0a%0athe following being the usual method of preparing it. Goats’ %0amilk, which is used in preference for the purpose, is boiled in %0aa new earthen vessel, and stirred with branches of a fig-tree %0anewly gathered, as many cyathi of honied wine being added to %0ait as there are semisextarii of milk. When the mixture boils, %0acare is taken to prevent it running over, by plunging into it a %0asilver cyathus measure filled with cold water, none of the water %0abeing allowed to escape. When taken off the fire, the constitu¬ %0aent parts of it divide as it cools, and the whey is thus separated %0afrom the milk. Some persons, again, take this whey, which is %0anow very strongly impregnated with wine, and, after boiling %0ait down to one third, leave it to cool in the open air. The %0abest way of taking it, is in doses of one semisextarius, at stated %0aintervals, during five consecutive days ; after taking it, riding %0aexercise should be used by the patient. This whey is admi¬ %0anistered in cases of epilepsy, melancholy, paralysis, leprosy, %0aelephantiasis, and diseases of the joints. %0a%0aMilk is employed as an injection where excoriations have %0abeen caused by the use of strong purgatives; in cases also %0awhere dysentery is productive of chafing, it is similarly em¬ %0aployed, boiled with sea pebbles or a ptisan of barley. Where, %0ahowever, the intestines are excoriated, cows’ milk or ewes’ %0amilk is the best. New milk is used as an injection for dysen¬ %0atery ; and in an unboiled state, it is employed for affections of %0athe colon and uterus, and for injuries inflicted by serpents. It %0ais also taken internally as an antidote to the venom of cantha- %0arides, the pine-caterpillar, the buprestis, and the salamander. %0aCows’ milk is particularly recommended for persons who have %0ataken colchicum, hemlock, dorycnium, 75 or the flesh of the sea- %0ahare; and asses’ milk, in cases where gypsum, white-lead, %0asulphur, 76 or quick-silver, have been taken internally. This %0alast is good too for constipation attendant upon fever, and is %0aremarkably useful as a gargle for ulcerations of the throat. It %0ais taken, also, internally, by patients suffering from atrophy, for %0athe purpose of recruiting their exhausted strength; as also in %0acases of fever unattended with head-ache. The ancients held %0ait as one of their grand secrets, to administer to children, before %0ataking food, a semisextarius of asses’ milk, or for want of that, %0agoats’ milk; a similar dose, too, was given to children troubled %0a75 See B. xxi. c. 105. %0a%0a' 6 He perhaps means a sulphate, and not sulphur, which is harmless. %0a%0aVOL.

It is considered a sove¬ %0areign remedy for hardness of breathing, to take cows’ milk %0awhey, mixed with nasturtium. In cases of ophthalmia, too, the %0aeyes are fomented with a mixture of one semisextarius of %0amilk and four drachmae of pounded sesame. %0a%0aGoats’ milk is a cure for diseases of the spleen ; hut in such %0acase the goats must fast a couple of days, and be fed on ivy- %0aleaves the third ; the patient, too, must drink the milk for three %0aconsecutive days, without taking any other nutriment. Milk, %0aunder other circumstances, is detrimental to persons suffering %0afrom head-ache, liver complaints, diseases of the spleen, and %0aaffections of the sinews; it is bad for fevers, also, vertigo— %0aexcept, indeed, where it is required as a purgative—oppression of %0athe head, coughs, and ophthalmia. Sows’ milk is extremely use¬ %0aful in cases of tenesmus, dysentery, and phthisis; authors have %0abeen found too, to assert that it is very wholesome for females. %0a%0aCHAP. 34.—TWELVE REMEDIES DEHIVED FROM CHEESE. %0a%0aWe have already" 7 spoken of the different kinds of cheese %0awhen treating of the mamillae and other parts of animals. %0aSextius attributes the same properties to mares’ milk cheese %0athat he does to cheese made of cows’ milk : to the former he %0agives the names of “ hippace.” Cheese is best for the sto¬ %0amach when not salted, or, in other words, when new cheese is %0aused. Old [salted] cheese has a binding effect upon the %0abowels, and reduces the flesh, but is more wholesome to %0athe stomach [than new salted cheese]. Indeed, we may pro¬ %0anounce of aliments in general, that salt meats reduce the system, %0awhile fresh food has a tendency to make flesh. Fresh cheese, %0aapplied with honey, effaces the marks of bruises. It acts, %0aalso, emolliently upon the bowels; and, taken in the form of %0atablets, boiled in astringent wine and then toasted with honey on %0aa platter, it modifies and alleviates griping pains in the bowels. %0a%0aThe cheese known as “ saprum,” 78 is beaten up, in wine, with %0asalt and dried sorb apples, and taken in drink, for the cure of %0acceliac affections. Goats’ milk cheese, pounded and applied to %0athe part affected, is a cure for carbuncle of the generative organs; %0asour cheese, also, with oxymel, is productive of a similar effect. %0aIn the bath it is used as a friction, alternately with oil, for the %0aremoval of spots. %0a%0a77 In B. xi. c. 97. 78 From the Greek aairpov , “rotten” cheese. %0a%0a79 Like our cream cheese, or new milk cheese, probably. %0a%0a%0aChap. 35.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BUTTER. %0a%0a%0a323 %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 35. -TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BUTTER. %0a%0aFrom milk, too, butter is produced ; held as the most delicate %0aof food among barbarous 80 nations, and one which distinguishes 61 %0athe wealthy from the multitude at large. It is mostly made %0afrom cows’ milk, and hence its name ; 82 but the richest butter %0ais that made from ewes’ milk. There is a butter made also %0afrom goats’ milk ; but previously to making it, the milk should %0afirst be warmed, in winter. In summer it is extracted from %0athe milk by merely shaking it to and fro in a tall vessel, with %0aa small orifice at the mouth to admit the air, but otherwise %0aclosely stopped, a little water 83 being added to make it curdle %0athe sooner. The milk that curdles the most, floats upon the sur¬ %0aface; this they remove, and, adding salt to it, give it the name %0aof “oxygala.” 81 They then take the remaining part and boil %0ait down in pots, and that portion of it which floats on the %0asurface is butter, a substance of an oily nature. The more 88 %0arank it is in smell, the more highly it is esteemed. When old, %0ait forms an ingredient in numerous compositions. It is of an %0aastringent, emollient, repletive, and purgative nature. %0a%0a60 The people of Germany and Scythia, for instance. %0a%0a81 In this passage also it is generally supposed that he refers to the %0anomadic life of barbarous nations, in which multitudes of sheep and %0acattle constituted the chief wealth. It is, however, not improbable that %0ahe means to say that among the Romans it was only the wealthy who could %0aafford to use it. %0a%0a82 hovTvpov , “cow cheese.” %0a%0a83 Qy. whether for “aquae,” “water,” we should not read “acidi” %0ahere, “ sour milk,” as at the beginning of the next Chapter ? Beckmann %0asuggests “aceti,” “vinegar.”— Hist. Inv. I. 505, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%0aw Beckmann says on this passage, “ What Pliny says respecting oxygala %0ais attended with difficulties : aud I am fully persuaded that his words are %0acorrupted, though I find no variations marked in MSS. by which this con¬ %0ajecture can be supported.”— Hist. Inv. I. 505. He suggests another %0aarrangement of the whole passage, but without improving it, for the diffi¬ %0aculty would appear to be totally imaginary; as it is quite clear that by %0a“oxygala,” or “sour milk," Pliny means the thickest part of the curd, %0awhich is first removed and then salted, forming probably a sort of cream %0acheese. Though his meaning is clear, he may very possibly give an %0aerroneous description of the process. %0a%0a85 The remark of Holland on this passage is curious—“ Some would %0a•mend this place, and for ‘ magis,’ ‘ more,’ put ‘ minus,’ ‘ less,’ in a con¬ %0atrary sense; but I suppose he writeth in regard of barbarous people, who %0amake more account of such ranke butyr: like as the uncivile Irish in %0athese daies.” %0a%0a%0a324 print's NATURAL HISTORY.

This pre¬ %0aparation is extremely wholesome to the stomach: of its pro¬ %0aperties we shall have occasion 86 to speak in another place. %0a%0aCHAP. 37. -THE VARIOUS USES OF FAT AND OBSERVATIONS UPON %0a%0aIT, FIFTY-TWO IN NUMBER. %0a%0aAmong the remedies common to living creatures, fat is the %0asubstance held in the next highest esteem, that of swine in %0aparticular, which was employed by the ancients for certain %0areligious purposes even : at all events, it is still the usage for %0athe newly-wedded bride, when entering her husband’s house, %0ato touch the door-posts with it. There are two methods of %0akeeping hogs’ lard, either salted or fresh ; indeed, the older it %0ais, the better. The Greek writers have now given it the name %0aof “ axungia,” 8 ' or axle-grease, in their works. Nor, in fact, %0ais it any secret, why swine’s fat should be possessed of such %0amarked properties, seeing that the animal feeds to such a great %0aextent upon the roots of plants—owing too, to which, its dung %0ais applied to such a vast number of purposes. It will be as %0awell, therefore, to premise, that I shall here speak only of the %0ahog that feeds in the open field, and no other; of which kind %0ait is the female that is much the most useful—if she has never %0afarrowed, more particularly. But it is the fat of the wild boar %0athat is held in by far the highest esteem of all. %0a%0aThe distinguishing properties, then, of swine’s-grease, are %0aemollient, calorific, resolvent, and detergent. Some physicians %0arecommend it as an ointment for the gout, mixed with goose- %0agrease, bull-suet, and wool-grease: in cases, however, where %0athe pain is persistent, it should be used in combination with %0awax, myrtle, resin, and pitch. Hogs’ lard is used fresh for %0athe cure of burns, and of blains, too, caused by snow: with %0aashes of burnt barley and nutgalls, in equal proportions, it is em¬ %0aployed for the cure of chilblains. It is good also for excoriations %0aof the limbs, and for dispelling weariness and lassitude arising %0afrom long journeys. For the cure of chronic cough, new %0alard is boiled down, in the proportion of three ounces to three %0a%0aHe has forgotten to do so, however. %0a%0a37 .

Old %0alard too, if it has been kept without salt, made up into pills %0aand taken internally, is a cure for phthisis: but it is a general %0arule not to use it salted in any cases except where detergents are %0arequired, or where there are no symptoms of ulceration. For %0athe cure of phthisis, some persons boil down three ounces of %0ahogs’ lard and honied wine, in three cyathi of ordinary wine ; %0aand after swathing the sides, chest, and shoulders of the patient %0awith compresses steeped in the preparation, administer to him, %0aevery four days, some tar with an egg: indeed, so potent is %0athis composition, that if it is only attached to the knees even, %0athe flavour of it will ascend to the mouth, and the patient %0awill appear to spit it out, 88 as it were. %0a%0aThe grease of a sow that has never farrowed, is the most %0auseful of all cosmetics for the skin of females; but in all cases, %0ahogs’ lard is good for the cure of itch-scab, mixed with pitch %0aand beef-suet in the proportion of one-third, the whole being %0amade lukewarm for the purpose. Fresh hogs’ lard, applied as %0aa pessary, imparts nutriment to the infant in the womb, and %0aprevents abortion. Mixed with white lead or litharge, it re¬ %0astores scars to their natural colour ; and, in combination with %0asulphur, it rectifies malformed nails. It prevents the hair also %0afrom falling off; and, applied with a quarter of a nutgall, it %0aheals ulcers upon the head in females. When well smoked, it %0astrengthens the eyelashes. Lard is recommended alsofor phthisis, %0aboiled down with old wine, in the proportion of one ounce to a %0asemisextarius, till only three ounces are left; some persons add %0aa little honey to the composition. Mixed with lime, it is used %0aas a liniment for inflamed tumours, boils, and indurations of %0athe mamillse: it is curative also of ruptures, convulsions, %0acramps, and sprains. Used with white hellebore, it is good %0afor corns, chaps, and callosities; and, with pounded earthen¬ %0aware 89 which has held salted provisions, for iraposthumes of %0athe parotid glands and scrofulous sores. Employed as a fric¬ %0ation in the bath, it removes itching sensations and pimples : but %0afor the treatment of gout there is another method of preparing %0ait, by mixing it with old oil, and adding pounded sarcopha¬ %0agus 90 stone and cinquefoil bruised in wine, or else with lime %0a%0a98 Hence it was a notion in the sixteenth century, that pitch and hogs’ %0alard is a cure for syphilis, by promoting salivation. %0a%0a89 “"Farina salsamentariae testae.” 90 See B. xxxvi. c. 27. %0a%0a%0a326 %0a%0a%0aplint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aor ashes. A peculiar kind of plaster is also made of it for the %0acure of inflammatory ulcers, seventy-five denarii of hogs’ lard %0abeing mixed with one hundred of litharge. %0a%0aIt is reckoned a very good plan also to anoint ulcers with %0aboars’ grease, and, if they are of a serpiginous nature, to add %0aresin to the liniment. The ancients used to employ hogs’ lard %0ain particular for greasing the axles of their vehicles, that the %0awheels might revolve the more easily, and to this, in fact, it owes %0aits name of “ axungia.” When hogs’ lard has been used for this %0apurpose, incorporated as it is with the rust of the iron upon %0athe wheels, it is remarkably useful as an application for dis¬ %0aeases of the rectum and of the generative organs. The ancient %0aphysicians, too, set a high value upon the medicinal properties %0aof hogs’ lard in an unmixed state: separating it from the %0akidneys, and carefully removing the veins, they used to wash %0aand rub it well in rain water, after which they boiled it several %0atimes in a new earthen vessel, and then put it by for keeping. %0aIt is generally agreed that it is more emollient, calorific, and %0aresolvent, when salted; and that it is still more useful when %0ait has been rinsed in wine. %0a%0aMassurius informs us, that the ancients set the highest %0avalue of all upon the fat of the wolf: and that it was for this %0areason that the newly-wedded bride used to anoint the door¬ %0aposts of her husband’s house with it, in order that no noxious %0aspells might find admittance. %0a%0achap. 38. —SUET. %0a%0aCorresponding with the grease of the swine, is the suet 91 that %0ais found in the ruminating animals, a substance employed in %0aother ways, but no less efficacious in its properties. The pro¬ %0aper mode of preparing it, in all cases, is to take out the veins %0aand to rinse it in sea or salt-water, after which it is beaten up %0ain a mortar, with a sprinkling of sea-water in it. This done, %0ait is boiled in several waters, until, in fact, it has lost all smell, %0aand is then bleached by continual exposure to the sunthat of %0athe most esteemed quality being the fat which grows about the %0akidneys. In case stale suet is required for any medicinal pur¬ %0apose, it is recommended to melt it first, and then to wash it in %0acold water several times; after which, it must again be melted %0awith a sprinkling of the most aromatic wine that can be pro- %0a91 “ Sebum ”—Suet or tallow. %0a%0a%0aChap. 40.] %0a%0a%0aGALL. %0a%0a%0a327 %0a%0a%0acured, it being then boiled again and again, until the rank %0a6mell has totally disappeared. %0a%0aMany persons recommend that the fat of bulls, lions, pan¬ %0athers, and camels, in particular, should be thus prepared. As %0ato the various uses to which these substances are applied, we %0ashall mention them on the appropriate occasions. %0a%0aCHAP. 39.-MARROW. %0a%0aCommon too, to all these animals, is marrow ; a substance %0awhich in all cases is possessed of certain emollient, expletive, %0adesiccative, and calorific properties. The most highly esteemed %0aof all is deer’s marrow, the next best being that of the calf, and %0athen that of the goat, both male and female. These substances %0aare prepared before autumn, by washing them in a fresh state, %0aand drying them in the shade ; after which they are passed %0athrough a sieve, and then strained through linen, and put by %0ain earthen pots for keeping, in a cool spot. %0a%0aCHAP. 40.-GALL. %0a%0aBut among the substances which are furnished in common %0aby the various animals, it is the gall, we may say, that is the %0amost efficacious of all. The properties of this substance are of %0aa calorific, pungent, resolvent, extractive, and dispersive nature. %0aThe gall of the smaller animals is looked upon as the most %0apenetrating; for which reason it is that it is generally con¬ %0asidered the most efficacious for the composition of eye-salves. %0aBull’s gall is possessed of a remarkable degree of potency, %0ahaving the effect of imparting a golden tint to the surface %0aof copper even and to vessels made of other metals. Gall in every %0acase is prepared in the following manner: it is taken fresh, %0aand the orifice of the vesicle in which it is contained being tied %0afast with a strong linen thread* it is left to steep for half %0aan hour in boiling water ; after which it is dried in the shade, %0aand then put away for keeping, in honey. %0a%0aThat of the horse is condemned, being reckoned among the %0apoisons only. Hence it is that the Flamen 92 of the Sacrifices %0ais not allowed to touch a horse, notwithstanding that it is the %0a%0a92 Or Flamen Dialis. Festus gives another reason: lest the Flamen %0ashould travel to a distance, and so neglect his duties. %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a328 %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0acustom to immolate one 93 of these animals at the public sacri¬ %0afices at Rome. %0a%0a%0aCHAP. 41.—BLOOD. %0a%0aThe blood, also, of the horse is possessed of certain corrosive %0aproperties ; and so, too, is mare’s blood—except, indeed, where %0athe animal has not been covered—it having the effect of %0acauterizing the margins of ulcers, and so enlarging them. %0aBull’s blood too, taken fresh, is reckoned 94 among the poisons; %0aexcept, indeed, at jEgira, 93 at which place the priestess of the %0aEarth, when about to foretell coming events, takes a draught %0aof bull’s blood before she descends into the cavern : so power- %0aful, in fact, is the agency of that sympathy so generally spoken %0aof, that it may occasionally originate, we find, in feelings of re¬ %0aligious awe, 96 or in the peculiar nature of the locality. %0a%0aDrusus, 97 the tribune of the people, drank goats’ blood, it is %0asaid ; it being his object by his pallid looks to suggest that his %0aenemy, Q. Csepio, had given him poison, and so expose him to %0apublic hatred. So remarkably powerful is the blood of the he- %0agoat, that there is nothing better in existence for sharpening %0airon implements, the rust produced by this blood giving them %0aa better edge even than a file. Considering, however, that the %0ablood of all animals cannot be reckoned as a remedy in common, %0awill it not be advisable, in preference, to speak of the effects %0athat are produced by that of each kind ? %0a%0aCHAP. 42.-PECULIAR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM VARIOUS ANIMALS, %0a%0aAND CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE MALADIES. REMEDIES %0a%0aAGAINST THE POISON OF SERPENTS, DERIVED FROM THE STAG, %0a%0aTHE FAWN, THE OPHION, THE SHE-GOAT, THE KID, AND THE %0a%0aASS. %0a%0aWe will therefore classify the various remedies, according %0ato the maladies for which they are respectively used; and, first %0aof all, those to which man has recourse for injuries inflicted by %0a%0a93 The “ Equus October,” sacrificed to Mars on the Campus Martius in %0aOctober. This sacrifice was attended with some very ridiculous ceremonies. %0a%0a94 This, as already observed, was probably a fallacy. %0a%0a95 See B. iv. c. 6. %0a%0a96 His meaning is, that the excitement produced by religious feeling %0aneutralizes that antipathy which, under ordinary circumstances, is manifested %0atowards the system by bull’s blood. %0a%0a97 See B. xxxiii. c. 6. %0a%0a%0achap. 42.] 11 EHEDIES AGAINST SEliPENTS. 329 %0a%0aserpents. That deer are destructive to those reptiles 98 no one %0ais ignorant; as also of the fact that they drag them from their %0aholes when they find them, and so devour them. And it is %0anot only while alive and breathing that deer are thus fatal to %0aserpents, but even when dead and separated limb from limb. %0aThe fumes of their horns, while burning, will drive away %0aserpents, as already 99 stated; but the bones, it is said, of the %0aupper part of a stag’s throat, if burnt upon a fire, will bring those %0areptiles together. Persons may sleep upon a deer’s skin in %0aperfect safety, and without any apprehension of attacks by %0aserpents; its rennet too, taken with vinegar, is an effectual anti¬ %0adote to the stings of those reptiles ; indeed, if it has been only %0atouched by a person, he will be for that day effectually pro¬ %0atected from them. The testes, dried, or the genitals of the %0amale animal, are considered to be very wholesome, taken in %0awine, and so are the umbles, generally known as the “ centi- %0apellio.” 1 Persons having about them a deer’s tooth, or who %0ahave taken the precaution of rubbing the body with a deer or %0afawn’s marrow, will be sure to repel the attacks of all serpents. %0a%0aBut the most effectual remedy of all is thought to be the %0arennet of a fawn that has been cut from the uterus of the %0adam, as already 3 mentioned in another place. Deer’s blood, %0aburnt upon a fire of lentisk wood, with dracontium, 3 cunilago, 4 %0aand alkanet, will attract serpents, they say; while, on the %0aother hand, if the blood is removed and pyrethrum 6 substituted %0afor it, they will take to flight. %0a%0aI find an animal mentioned by Greek writers, smaller than %0athe stag, but resembling it in the hail’, and to which they give %0athe name of “ ophion.” 6 Sardinia, they say, is the only coun¬ %0atry that produces it; I am of opinion, however, that it is now %0aextinct, and for that reason I shall not enlarge upon its medi¬ %0acinal properties. %0a%0a(10.) As a preservative against the attacks of serpents, the %0abrains and blood of the wild boar are held in high esteem: %0athe liver also, dried and taken in wine with rue ; and the fat, %0a%0a99 See B. viii. c. 50. 99 In B. viii. c. 50. %0a%0a1 Or “ hundred skins.” Called the mirefeuilkt in French. %0a%0a* In B. viii. c. 50. 3 See B. xxiv. c. 91. %0a%0a4 See B. xx. c. 63. %0a%0a6 The Antherais pyrethrum of Linnaeus, Spanish camomile or pellitory. %0a%0a9 Possibly the Musiuou of B. viii. c. 49.

Similar properties are attributed %0ato the liver of the domesticated boar and the outer filaments, %0aand those only, of the gall, these last being taken in doses of %0afour denarii; the brains also, taken in wine, are equally ef¬ %0afectual. The fumes of the burning horns or hair of a she-goat %0awill repel serpents, they say: the ashes, too, of the horns, used %0aeither internally or externally, are thought to be an antidote %0ato their poison. A similar effect is attributed to goats’ milk, %0ataken with Taminian 1 grapes ; to the urine of those animals, %0ataken with squill vinegar; to goats’ milk cheese, applied with %0aoriganum ; 8 and to goat suet, used with wax. %0a%0aIn addition to all this, as will be seen hereafter, there are a %0athousand other remedial properties attributed to this animal; %0aa fact which surprises me all the more, seeing that the goat, %0ait is said, is never free from fever. 9 The w r ild animals of the %0asame species, which are very numerous, as already 10 stated, %0ahave a still greater efficacy attributed to them; but the he- %0agoat has certain properties peculiar to itself, and Democritus %0aattributes properties Btill more powerful to the animal when it %0ahas been the only one yeaned. It is recommended also to apply %0ashe-goat’s dung, boiled 11 in vinegar, to injuries inflicted by %0aserpents, as also the ashes of fresh dung mixed with wine. %0aAs a general rule, persons who find that they are recovering %0abut slowly from injuries inflicted by a serpent, will find their %0ahealth more speedily re-established by frequenting the stalls %0awhere goats are kept. Those, however, whose object is a more %0aassured remedy, attach immediately to the "wound the paunch %0aof a she-goat killed for the purpose, dung and all. Others, %0aagain, use the flesh of a kid just killed, and fumigate it with %0athe singed hair, the smell of which has the effect of repelling %0aserpents. %0a%0aFor stings of serpents, as also for injuries inflicted by the %0ascorpion and shrew-mouse, some employ the skin of a goat %0anewly killed, as also the flesh and dung of a horse that has %0abeen out at pasture, or a hare’s rennet in vinegar. They say, %0atoo, that if a person has the body well rubbed with a hare’s %0arennet, he will never receive injury from venomous animals. %0aWhen a person has been stung by a scorpion, she-goat’s dung, %0a%0a7 See B. xxiii. cc. 13, 14. 8 See B. xx. c. 67. %0a%0a9 See B. viii. c. 76. 10 In B. viii. c. 76. %0a%0a11 A remedy of which H.

Nay, %0awhat is even more than this, if a person applies his mouth to %0aan ass’s ear, and says that he has been stung by a scorpion, the %0awhole of the poison, they say, will immediately pass away %0afrom him and be transferred to the animal. All venomous %0acreatures, it is said, are put to flight by a fumigation made %0aby burning an ass’s lights. It is considered an excellent %0aplan too, to fumigate persons, when stung by a scorpion, with %0athe 6moke of burnt calves’ dung. %0a%0aCHAT. 43. —REMEDIES FOE THE BITE OF THE MAD DOG. KEMED1ES %0a%0aDERIVED FROM THE CAiF, THE HE-GOAT, AND VARIOUS OTHER %0a%0aANIMALS. %0a%0aWhen a person has been bitten by a mad dog, it is the %0apractice to make an incision round the wound to the quick, %0aand then to apply raw veal to it, and to make the patient %0atake either veal broth or hogs’ lard, mixed with lime internally. %0aSome persons recommend a he-goat’s liver, and maintain that %0aif it is applied to the wound the patient will never be attacked %0awith hydrophobia. She-goat’s dung, too, is highly spoken of, %0aapplied with wine, as also the dung of the badger, cuckoo, and %0aswallow, boiled and taken in drink. %0a%0aFor bites inflicted by other animals, dried goats’ milk cheese %0ais applied with origanum and taken with the drink; and for %0ainjuries caused by the human 12 teeth, boiled beef is applied; %0aveal, however, is still more efficacious for the purpose, provided %0ait is not removed before the end of four days. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. —REMEDIES TO BE ADOPTED AGAINST ENCHANTMENTS. %0a%0aThe dried muzzle of a wolf, they say, is an effectual preser¬ %0avative against the malpractices of magic; and it is for this %0areason that it is so commonly to be seen fastened to the doors of %0afarm-houses. A similar degree of efficacy, it is thought, %0abelongs to the skin of the neck, when taken whole from the %0aanimal. Indeed, so powerful is the influence of this animal, %0ain addition to what we have already 13 stated, that if a horse %0a%0a12 Cloquet says that the application would be useless. %0a%0a13 In b. viii. c. 34. %0a%0a%0a332 PLINY’S NATTJBAL HISTOBY.

Poisons are neutralized by %0ataking asses’ milk; henbane more particularly, mistletoe, hem¬ %0alock, the flesh of the sea-hare, opocarpathon , 16 pharicon , 17 and %0adorycnium : 18 the same, too, where coagulated milk 19 has been %0aproductive of bad effects, for the biestings , 20 or first curdled %0amilk, should be reckoned as nothing short of a poison . 21 We %0ashall have to mention many other uses to which asses’ milk is %0aapplied ; but it should be remembered that in all cases it must %0abe used fresh, or, if not, as new as possible, and warmed, for %0athere is nothing that more speedily loses its virtue. The %0abones, too, of the ass are pounded and boiled, as an antidote to %0athe poison of the sea-hare. The wild ass 22 is possessed of %0asimilar properties in every, respect, but in a much higher %0adegree. %0a%0aOf the wild horse 23 the Greek writers have made no mention, %0ait not being a native of their country ; we have every reason to %0abelieve, however, that it has the same properties as the animal %0ain a tame state, but much more fully developed. Mares’ milk %0aeffectually neutralizes the venom of the sea-hare and all %0anarcotic poisons. Nor had the Greeks any knowledge from %0aexperience of the urus 24 and the bison , 24 although in India the %0aforests are filled with herds of wild oxen : it is only reasonable, %0a%0a14 Cloquet and Ajasson admit the truth of this statement: the latter %0asuggests that it may be owing to electricity. %0a%0a15 It is no longer reckoned among the poisons. %0a%0a76 Juice of carpathum, a substance which does not appear to have been %0aidentified; but supposed by Bruce to have been a gum called sassa, with %0awhich aloes are adulterated in Abyssinia, a thing that Galen tells us was %0adone with the carpathum of the ancients.

It is asserted also, that cows’ milk is a general %0acounter-poison, in the cases above-mentioned, more particularly, %0aas also where the poison of ephemeron 25 has settled internally, %0aor cantharides have been administered ; it acting upon the %0apoison by vomit. Broth, too, made from goats’ flesh, neutral¬ %0aizes the effects of cantharides, in a similar manner, it is said. %0aTo counteract the corrosive poisons which destroy by ulcer¬ %0aation, veal or beef-suet is resorted to; and in cases where a %0aleech has been swallowed, butter is the usual remedy, with %0avinegar heated with a red-hot iron. Indeed, butter employed %0aby itself is a good remedy for poisons, for where oil is not %0ato be procured, it is an excellent substitute for it. Used with %0ahoney, butter heals injuries inflicted by millepedes. The %0abroth of boiled tripe, it is thought, is an effectual repellent of %0athe above-mentioned poisons, aconite and hemlock more par¬ %0aticularly ; veal-suet also has a similar repute. %0a%0aFresh goats’ milk cheese is given to persons who have taken %0amistletoe, and goats’ milk itself is a remedy for cantharides. %0aTaken with Taminian 26 grapes, goats’ milk is an antidote to the %0aeffects of ephemeron. Goats’ blood, boiled down with the mar¬ %0arow, is used as a remedy for the narcotic 21 poisons, and kids’ blood %0afor the other poisons. Kid’s rennet is administered where per¬ %0asons have taken mistletoe, the juice of the white chamseleon, 28 %0aor bull’s blood; for which last, hare’s rennet in vinegar is also %0aused by way of antidote. For injuries inflicted by the pasti- %0anaca, 29 and the stings or bites of all kinds of marine animals, %0ahare’6 rennet, kid’s rennet, or lamb’s rennet is taken, in doses %0aof one drachma, in wine. Hare’s rennet, too, generally forms %0aan ingredient in the antidotes for poisons. %0a%0aThe moth that is seen fluttering about the flame of a lamp %0ais generally reckoned in the number of the noxious substances : %0aits bad effects are neutralized by the agency of goat’s liver. %0aGoat's gall, too, is looked upon as an antidote to venomous %0a%0a25 See B. sxv. c. 107, and B. xxvi. c. 75. %0a%0a26 See B. xxiii. cc. 13, 14. %0a%0a27 “Toxica”—properly, those poisons in which the barbarous nations %0adipped their arrows. %0a%0a26 See B. xxii. c. 21. 29 Or, sting-ray. %0a%0a%0a334 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0apreparations from the field weazel. 30 But we will now return %0ato the other remedies, classified according to the various diseases. %0a%0aCHAr. 46. (11.) -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE HEAD, ANU %0a%0aFOR ALOPECY. %0a%0aBears’ grease, 31 mixed with ladanum 32 and the plant adi- %0aantum, 33 prevents the hair from falling off; it is a cure also %0afor alopecy and defects in the eyebrows, mixed with the fungus %0afrom the wick of a lamp, and the soot that is found in the %0anozzle. Used with wine, it is good for the cure of porrigo, a %0amalady which is also treated with the ashes of deer’s horns in %0awine: this last substance also prevents the growth of vermin %0ain the hair. For porrigo some persons employ goat’s gall, in %0acombination with Cimolian chalk and vinegar, leaving the pre- %0apration to dry for a time on the head. Sow’s gall, too, mixed %0awith bull’s urine, is employed for a similar purpose ; and when %0aold, it is an effectual cure, with the addition of sulphur, for %0afurfuraceous eruptions. The ashes, it is thought, of an ass’s %0agenitals, will make the hair grow more thickly, and prevent it %0afrom turning grey ; the proper method of applying it being to %0ashave the head and to pound the ashes in a leaden mortar with %0aoil. Similar effects are attributed to the genitals of an ass’s %0afoal, reduced to ashes and mixed with urine ; some nard being %0aadded to render the mixture less offensive. In cases of alopecy %0athe part affected is rubbed with bull’s gall, warmed with %0aEgyptian alum. Running ulcers of the head are successfully %0atreated with bull’s urine, or stale human urine, in combination %0awith cyclaminos 34 and sulphur : but the most effectual remedy is %0acalf’s gall, a substance which, heated with vinegar, has also the %0aeffect of exterminating lice. Yeal suet, pounded with salt and %0aapplied to ulcers of the head, is a very useful remedy : the fat, %0atoo, of the fox is highly spoken of, but the greatest value is %0aset upon cats’ dung, applied in a similar manner with mustard. %0a%0aPowdered goats’ horns, or the horns reduced to ashes, those %0aof the he-goat in particular, with the addition of nitre, tama¬ %0arisk-seed, butter, and oil, are remarkably effectual for prevent¬ %0aing the hair from coming off, the head being first shaved for %0athe purpose. So too, the ashes of burnt goats’ flesh, applied %0a%0a30 See B. xxix. c. 16. %0a%0a31 This substance still maintains its reputation, as preservative of the %0a%0ahair. 32 See B. xii. c. 37, and B. xxvi. c. 30. %0a%0a33 See B. xxii. c. 30. 34 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%0a%0aChap. 47.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOR THE EYES. %0a%0a%0a335 %0a%0a%0ato the eye-brows -with oil, impart to them a black tint. By %0ausing goats’ milk, they say, lice may be exterminated; and the %0adung of those animals, with honey, is thought to be a cure for %0aalopecy : the ashes, too, of the hoofs, mixed with pitch, prevent %0athe hair from coming off. %0a%0aThe ashes of a burnt hare, mixed with oil of myrtle, alle¬ %0aviate head-ache, the patient drinking some water that has %0abeen left in the trough after an ox or ass has been drinking %0athere. The male organs of a fox, worn as an amulet, are %0aproductive, if we choose to believe it, of a similar effect: the %0asame, too, with the ashes of a burnt deer’s horn, applied with %0avinegar, rose oil, or oil of iris. %0a%0aCHAP. 47. -REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. %0a%0aFor defluxions 35 of the eyes, beef suet, boiled with oil, is %0aapplied to the parts affected; and for eruptions of those organs, %0aashes of burnt deer’s horns are similarly employed, the tips of %0athe horns being considered the most effectual for the purpose. %0aFor the cure of cataract, it is reckoned a good plan to apply %0aa wolf’s excrements: the same substance, too, reduced to %0aashes, is used for the dispersion of films, in combination with %0aAttic honey. Bear’s gall, too, is similarly employed ; and for %0athe cure of epinyctis, wild boar’s lard, mixed with oil of %0aroses, is thought to be very useful. An ass’s hoof, reduced to %0aashes and applied with asses’ milk, is used for the removal of %0amarks in the eyes and indurations of the crystalline humours. %0aBeef marrow, from the right fore leg, beaten up with soot, %0ais employed for affections of the eyebrows, and for diseases %0aof the eyelids and corners of the eyes. For the same purpose, %0aalso, a sort of calliblepharon 36 is prepared from soot, the best %0aof all being that made from a wick of papyrus mixed with %0aoil of sesame ; the soot being removed with a feather and %0acaught in a new vessel prepared for the purpose. This mix¬ %0ature, too, is very efficacious for preventing superfluous eye¬ %0alashes from growing again when once pulled out. %0a%0aBull’s gall is made up into eye-salves 37 with white of egg, %0a%0a35 If they are occasioned by irritation, Ajasson thinks that Pliny’s re¬ %0amedy may be of some utility. %0a%0aM A cosmetic for “ beautifying the eye-brows.” %0a%0a37 “Collyria.” %0a%0a%0a336 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0athese salves being steeped in water and applied to the eyes for %0afour days successively. Veal suet, with goose-grease and the %0aextracted juice of ocimum, is remarkably good for diseases of %0athe eye-lids. Veal marrow, with the addition of an equal %0aproportion of wax and oil or oil of roses, an egg being added %0ato the mixture, is used as a liniment for indurations of the eye¬ %0alids. Soft goats’ milk cheese is used as an application, with %0awarm water, to allay defluxions of the eyes; but when they %0aare attended with swelling, honey is used instead of the water. %0aIn both cases, however, the eyes should be fomented with %0awarm whey. In cases of dry ophthalmia, it is found a very %0auseful plan to take the muscles 38 lying within a loin of pork, %0aand, after reducing them to ashes, to pound and apply them to %0athe part affected. %0a%0aShe-goats, they say, are never affected with ophthalmia, %0afrom the circumstance that they browse upon certain kinds of %0aherbs: the same, too, with the gazelle. Hence it is that we %0afind it recommended, at the time of new moon, to swallow the %0adung of these animals, coated with wax. As they are able to %0asee, too, by night, it is a general belief that the blood of a he- %0agoat is a cure for those persons affected with dimness of sight %0ato whom the Greeks have given the name of “ nyctalopes .”' 19 %0aA similar virtue is attributed to the liver of a she-goat, boiled %0ain astringent wine. Some are in the habit of rubbing the eyes %0awith the thick gravy 40 which exudes from a she-goat’s liver %0aroasted, or with the gall of that animal: they recommend the %0aflesh also as a diet, and say that the patient should expose %0ahis eyes to the fumes of it while boiling: it is a general %0aopinion, too, that the animal should be of a reddish colour. %0aAnother prescription is, to fumigate the eyes with the steam %0aarising from the liver boiled in an earthen jar, or, according to %0asome authorities, roasted. %0a%0aGoats’ gall is applied for numerous purposes: with honey, %0afor films upon the eyes; with one-third part of white hellebore, %0afor cataract; with wine, for spots upon the eyes, indurations of %0athe cornea, films, webs, and argema; with extracted juice %0aof cabbage, for diseases of the eyelids, the hairs being first %0apulled out, and the preparation left to dry on the parts affected; %0a%0a38 This is the translation suggested by Dalechamps for “ lumbulis.” %0a%0a39 “ Seers by night.” u “ Same.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 48.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOE THE EARS. %0a%0a%0a337 %0a%0a%0aand with woman's milk, for rupture of the coats of the eye. %0aFor all these purposes, the gall is considered the most effica¬ %0acious, when dried. Nor is the dung of this animal held in %0adisesteem, being applied with honey for defluxions of the eyes. %0aThe marrow, too, of a goat, or a hare’s lights, we find used %0afor pains in the eyes; and the gall of a goat, with raisin wine %0aor honey, for the dispersion of films upon those organs. It is %0arecommended also, for ophthalmia, to anoint the eyes with %0awolf’s fat or swine’s marrow : we find it asserted, too, that per¬ %0asons who carry a wolf’s tongue, inserted in a bracelet, will %0aalways be exempt from ophthalmia. %0a%0aCHAP. 48 . -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES AND AFFECTIONS OF %0a%0aTHE EARS. %0a%0aPains and diseases of the ears are cured by using the urine %0aof a wild boar, kept in a glass vessel, or the gall of a wild %0aboar, swine, or ox, mixed with castor-oil and oil of roses in %0aequal proportions. But the best remedy of all is bull’s gall, %0awarmed with leek juice, or with honey, if there is any suppu¬ %0aration. Bull’s gall too, warmed by itself in a pomegranate %0arind, is an excellent remedy for offensive exhalations from the %0aears: in combination with woman’s milk, it is efficacious as a %0acure for ruptures of those organs. Some persons are of opinion %0athat it is a good plan to wash the ears with this preparation in %0acases where the hearing is affected ; while others again, after %0awashing the ears with warm water, insert a mixture composed %0aof the old slough of a serpent and vinegar, wrapped up in a %0adossil of wool. In cases, however, where the deafness is very %0aconsiderable, gall warmed in a pomegranate rind with myrrh %0aand rue, is injected into the ears; sometimes, also, fat bacon %0ais used for this purpose, or fresh asses’ dung, mixed with oil %0aof roses: in all cases, however, the ingredients should be %0awarmed. %0a%0aThe foam from a horse’s mouth is better still, or the ashes %0aof fresh horse dung, mixed with oil of roses : fresh butter too %0ais good; beef-suet mixed -with goose-grease; the urine of a %0abull or she-goat; or fullers’ lant, heated to such a degree that %0athe steam escapes by the neck of the vessel. For this purpose %0aalso, one third part of vinegar is mixed with a small portion of %0athe urine of a calf, which has not begun to graze. They apply %0aalso to the ears calf’s dung, mixed with the gall of that animal %0a%0aVOL. V.

Veal-suet, too, is used, with goose-grease and extract of %0aocimum; or else veal marrow, mixed with bruised cummin %0aand injected into the ears. For pains in the ears, the liquid %0aejected by a boar in copulation is used, due care being taken to %0areceive it before it falls to the ground. For fractures of the %0aears, a glutinous composition is made from the genitals of a %0acalf, which is dissolved in water when used; and for other %0adiseases of those organs, foxes’ fat is employed, goat’s gall %0amixed with rose-oil warmed, or else extracted juice of leeks: %0ain all cases where there is any rupture, these preparations are %0aused in combination with woman’s milk. Where a patient is %0asuffering from hardness of hearing, ox-gall is employed, with %0athe urine of a he or she-goat; the same, too, where there is %0aany suppuration. %0a%0aWhatever the purpose for which they are wanted, it is the %0ageneral opinion that these substances are more efficacious when %0athey have been smoked in a goat’s horn for twenty days. %0aHare’s rennet, too, is highly spoken of, taken in Aminean 41 %0awine, in the proportion of one third of a denarius of rennet to %0aone half of a denarius of saeopenum . 43 Bears’ grease, mixed %0awith equal proportions of wax and bull-suet, is a cure for %0aimposthumes of the parotid glands: some persons add hy- %0apocisthis 43 to the composition, or else content themselves with %0aemploying butter only, after first fomenting the parts affected %0awith a decoction of fenugreek, the good effects of which are %0aaugmented by strychnos. The testes, too, of the fox, are very %0auseful for this purpose; as also bull’s blood, dried and reduced %0ato powder. She-goats’ urine, made warm, is used as an injec¬ %0ation for the ears; and a liniment is made of the dung of those %0aanimals, in combination with axle-grease. %0a%0aCHAP. 49 . -REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACHE. %0a%0aThe ashes of deer's horns strengthen loose teeth and allay %0atooth-ache, used either as a friction or as a gargle. Some persons, %0ahowever, are of opinion that the horn, unburnt and reduced to %0apowder, is still more efficacious for all these purposes. Denti¬ %0africes are made both from the powder and the ashes. Another %0a%0a41 See B. xiv. c. 4. 43 See B. xx. c. 75. %0a%0a43 See B. xxvi. c. 31. %0a%0a%0aChap- 49-] %0a%0a%0aBEMEDIES FOE TOOTH-ACHE. %0a%0a%0a339 %0a%0a%0aexcellent remedy is a wolf’s head, reduced to ashes: it is a %0awell-known fact, too, that there are bones generally found in %0athe excrements of that animal; these bones, attached to the %0abody as an amulet, are productive of advantageous effects. For %0athe cure of tooth-ache, hare’s rennet is injected into the ear : %0athe head also of that animal, reduced to ashes, is used in the %0aform of a dentifrice, and, with the addition of nard, is a correc¬ %0ative of bad breath. Some persons, however, think it a better %0aplan to mix the ashes of a mouse’s head with the dentifrice. %0aIn the side of the hare there is a bone found, similar to a %0aneedle in appearance : for the cure of tooth-ache it is recom¬ %0amended to scarify the gums with this bone. The pastern-bone %0aof an ox, ignited and applied to loose teeth which ache, has %0athe effect of strengthening them in the sockets ; the same bone, %0areduced to ashes, and mixed with myrrh, is also used as a denti¬ %0africe. The ashes of burnt pig’s feet are productive of a similar %0aeffect, as also the calcined bones of the cotyloid cavities in which %0athe hip-bones move. It is a well-known fact, that, introduced %0ainto the throat of beasts of burden, these bones are a cure for %0aworms, and that, in a calcined state, they are good for strength¬ %0aening the teeth. %0a%0aWhen the teeth have been loosened by a blow, they are %0astrengthened by using asses’ milk, or else ashes of the burnt %0ateeth of that animal, or a horse’s lichen, reduced to powder, %0aand injected into the ear with oil. By lichen 45 1 do not mean %0athe hippomanes, a noxious substance which I purposely forbear %0ato enlarge upon, but an excrescence which forms upon the %0aknees of horses, and just above the hoofs. In the heart 40 of %0athis animal there is also found a bone which bears a close %0aresemblance to the eye-teeth of a dog : if the gums are scarified %0awith this bone, or with a tooth taken from the jaw-bone of a %0adead horse, corresponding in place with the tooth affected, the %0apain will be removed, they say. Anaxilaiis assures us that if %0athe liquid which exudes from a mare w r hen covered, is ignited %0aon the wick of a lamp, it will give out a most marvellous %0arepresentation 47 of horses’ heads ; and the same with reference %0a%0a44 See B. xxi. c. 105. 45 See B. viii. c. 66. %0a%0a46 See B. xi. c. 70. Ajnsson remarks that this bone is only found in %0aanimals that have undergone much fatigue, and that it results from the %0aconsolidation of certain tendinous fibres which form the ligament of the heart. %0a%0a41 “ Capitum visus ” seems to be a more probable reading than “ capi- %0a%0az 2 %0a%0a%0a340 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIIr. %0a%0a%0ato the she-ass. As to the hippomanes, it is possessed of proper¬ %0aties so virulent and so truly magical, that if it is only thrown %0ainto fused metal 48 which is being cast into the resemblance of %0aan Olympian mare, it will excite in all stallions that approach %0ait a perfect frenzy for copulation. %0a%0aAnother remedy for diseases of the teeth is joiners’ glue, %0aboiled in water and applied, care being taken to remove it very %0aspeedily, and instantly to rinse the teeth with wine in which %0asweet pomegranate-rind has been boiled. It is considered, %0aalso, a very efficacious remedy to wash the teeth with goats’ %0amilk, or bull’s gall. The pastern-bones of a she-goat just %0akilled, reduced to ashes, and indeed, to avoid the necessity for %0arepetition, of any other four-footed beast reared in the farm¬ %0ayard, are considered to make an excellent dentifrice. %0a%0aCHAP. 50 . ( 12 .) -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FACE. %0a%0aIt is generally believed that asses’ milk effaces wrinkles in %0athe face, renders the skin more delicate, and preserves its white¬ %0aness : and it is a well-known fact, that some women are in the %0ahabit of washing their face with it seven 49 hundred times daily, %0astrictly observing that number. Poppaea, the wife of the %0aEmperor Nero, was the first to practise this; indeed, she had %0asitting-baths, prepared solely with asses’ milk, for which pur¬ %0apose whole troops of she-asses 50 used to attend her on her jour- %0anies. 51 Purulent eruptions on the face are removed by an %0aapplication of butter, but white lead, mixed with the hutter, %0ais an improvement. Pure butter, alone, is used for serpigi¬ %0anous eruptions of the face, a layer of barley-meal being pow¬ %0adered over it. The caul of a cow that has just calved, is %0aapplied, while still moist, to ulcers of the face. %0a%0aThe following recipe may seem frivolous, but still, to please %0athe women, 52 it must not be omitted; the pastern-bone of a %0awhite steer, they say, boiled forty days and forty nights, till it is %0a%0aturn usus ” given by Sillig. Be it what it may, the meaning of the pas¬ %0asage is doubtful. %0a%0a48 See ASlian, Var. Hist. xiv. 18. %0a%0a49 There surely must be a wrong reading here, or he cannot intend this %0a%0ato be understood literally. 50 See B. xi. c. 96. %0a%0a51 One of the mistresses of Louis XV. not only did this, but (in a spirit %0aof great charity and consideration, of course) gave the milk to the poor %0aafter she had thus used it. %0a%0a** “ Ad desideria mulierum.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 50 ] EEMKDIKG FOE D1SEASE8 OF THE FACE. 3-31 %0a%0aquite dissolved, and then applied to the face in a linen cloth, %0awill remove wrinkles and preserve the whiteness of the s kin . %0aAn application of bull’s dung, they say, will impart a rosy %0atint to the cheeks, and not crocodilea 53 even is better for the %0apurpose ; the face, however, must be washed with cold water, %0aboth before and after the application. Sun-burns and all other %0adiscolorations of the skin, are removed by the aid of calves’ %0adung kneaded up by hand with oil and gum ; ulcerations and %0achaps of the mouth, by an application of veal or beef-suet, %0amixed with goose-grease and juice of ocimum. There is %0aanother composition, also, made of veal - suet with stag’s %0amarrow and leaves of white-thorn, the whole beaten up %0atogether. Marrow, too, mixed with resin, even if it be cow %0amarrow only, is equally good; and the broth of cow-beef is %0aproductive of similar effects. A most excellent remedy for %0alichens on the face is a glutinous substance prepared from the %0agenitals of a male calf, melted with vinegar and live sulphur, %0aand stirred together with the branch of a fig-tree : this com¬ %0aposition is applied twice a day, and should be used quite fresh. %0aThis glue, similarly prepared from a decoction of honey and %0avinegar, is a cure for leprous spots, which are also removed by %0aapplying a he-goat’s liver warm. %0a%0aElephantiasis, too, is removed by an application of goats’ %0agall; and leprous spots and furfuraceous eruptions by em¬ %0aploying bull’s gall with the addition of nitre, or else asses’ urine %0aabout the rising of the Dog-star. Spots on the face are re¬ %0amoved by either bull’s gall or ass’s gall diluted in water by %0aitself, care being taken to avoid the sun or w r ind after the skin %0ahas peeled off. A similar effect is produced, also, by using bull’s %0agall or calf’s gall, in combination with seed of cunila and the %0aashes of a deer’s horn, burnt at the rising of Canicula. %0a%0aAsses’ fat, in particular, restores the natural colour to scars %0aand spots on the skin caused by lichen or leprosy. A he-goat’s %0agall, mixed with cheese, live sulphur, and sponge reduced %0ato ashes, effectually removes freckles, the composition being %0abrought to the consistency of honey before being applied. %0aSome persons, however, prefer using dried gall, and mix with it %0awarm bran, in the proportion of one obolus to four oboli of honey, %0athe spots being rubbed briskly first. He-goat suet, too, is highly %0a%0a%0aM See c. 28 of this Book. %0a%0a%0a342 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’8 NATURAL III8T0KY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aefficacious, used in combination with gith, sulphur, and iris; this %0amixture being also employed, with goose-grease, stag’s marrow, %0aresin, and lime, for the cure of cracked lips. I find it stated %0aby certain authors, that persons who have freckles on the skin %0aare looked upon as disqualified from taking any part in the %0asacrifices prescribed by the magic art. %0a%0aCHAP. 51.- REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE TONSILLARY GLANDS, %0a%0aAND FOR SCROFULA. %0a%0aCow’s milk or goat’s milk is good for ulcerations of the %0atonsillary glands and of the trachea. It is used in the form of %0aa gargle, warm from the udder or heated, goat’s milk being %0athe best, boiled with mallows and a little salt. A broth made %0afrom tripe is an excellent gargle for ulcerations of the tongue and %0atrachea; and for diseases of the tonsillary glands, the kidneys of a %0afox are considered a sovereign remedy, dried and beaten up with %0ahoney, and applied externally. For quinzy, bull’s gall or goat’s %0agall is used, mixed with honey. A badger’s liver, taken in %0awater, is good for offensive breath, and butter has a healing %0aeffect upon ulcerations of the mouth. When a pointed or %0aother substance has stuck in the throat, by rubbing it exter¬ %0anally with cats’ dung, the substance, they say, ■will either come %0aup again or pass downwards into the stomach. %0a%0aScrofulous sores are dispersed by applying the gall of a wild %0aboar or of an ox, warmed for the purpose: but it is only when the %0asores are ulcerated that hare’s rennet is used, applied in a linen %0acloth with wine. The ashes of the burnt hoof of an ass or %0ahorse, applied with oil or water, is good for dispersing scrofu¬ %0alous sores; warmed urine also; the ashes of an ox’s hoof, %0ataken in water; cow-dung, applied hot with vinegar; goat- %0asuet with lime ; goats’ dung, boiled in vinegar; or the testes %0aof a fox. Soap, 51 too, is very useful for this purpose, an %0ainvention of the Gauls for giving a reddish 55 tint to the hair. %0aThis substance is prepared from tallow and ashes, the best ashes %0afor the purpose being those of the beech and yoke-elm : there %0aare two kinds of it, the hard soap and the liquid, both of them %0amuch used by the people of Germany, the men, in particular, %0amore than the women. %0a%0a54 See Beckmann’s Hist.

For the painful cramp, attended with %0ainflexibility, to which people give the name of “ opisthotony,” %0athe urine of a she-goat, injected into the ears, is found very %0auseful; as also a liniment made of the dung of that animal, %0amixed with bulbs. %0a%0aIn cases where the nails have been crushed, it is an excel¬ %0alent plan to attach to them the gall of any kind of animal. %0aWhitlows upon the fingers should be treated with dried %0abull’s gall, dissolved in warm water. Some persons are in the %0ababit of adding sulphur and alum, of each an equal weight. %0a%0aCnAP. 53. -REMEDIES FOR COUGH AND FOR SPITTING OF BLOOD. %0a%0aA wolf’s liver, administered in mulled wine, is a cure for %0acough; a bear’s gall also, mixed with honey; the ashes of the %0atips of a cow’s horn ; or else the saliva of a horse, taken in the %0adrink for three consecutive days—in which last case the horse %0awill be sure to die, they say. 66 A deer’s lights are useful for %0athe same purpose, dried with the gullet of the animal in the %0a6moke, and then beaten up with honey, and taken daily as an %0aelectuary: the spitter 67 deer, be it remarked, is the kind that %0ais the most efficacious for the purpose. %0a%0aSpitting of blood is cured by taking ashes of burnt deer’s %0ahorns, or else a hare’s rennet in drink, in doses of one-third %0aof a denarius, with Samian earth and myrtle-wine. The dung %0aof this last animal, reduced to ashes and taken in the evening, %0awith wine, is good for coughs that are recurrent at night. %0aThesmoke, too, of a hare’s fur, inhaled, has the effect of bring¬ %0aing off from the lungs such humours as are difficult to be dis¬ %0acharged by expectoration. Purulent ulcerations of the chest %0aand lungs, and bad breath proceeding from a morbid state of %0athe lungs, are successfully treated with butter boiled with an %0aequal quantity of Attic honey till it assumes a reddish hue, a %0aspoonful of the mixture being taken by the patient every %0amorning: some persons, however, instead of honey prefer %0ausing larch-resin for the purpose.

Fluxes are healed by %0ataking the ashes of burnt deer’s horns ; and discharges of blood %0aby drinking the blood of a kid just killed, made hot, in doses %0aof three cyathi, with equal proportions of vinegar and tart %0awine ; or else by taking kid’s rennet, with twice the quantity %0aof vinegar. %0a%0aCHAP. 55. -REMEDIES FOR LIVER COMPLAINTS AND FOR ASTHMA. %0a%0aLiver complaints are cured by taking a wolf’s liver dried, in %0ahonied wine ; or by using the dried liver of an ass, with twice %0athe quantity of rock-parsley and three nuts, the whole beaten %0aup with honey and taken with the food. The blood, too, of a %0ahe-goat is prepared and taken with the food. For persons suf¬ %0afering from asthma, the most efficient remedy of all is the blood %0aof wild horses 69 taken in drink ; and next to that, asses’ milk %0aboiled with bulbs, the whey being the part used, with the %0aaddition of nasturtium steeped in water and tempered with %0ahoney, in the proportion of one cyathus of nasturtium to three %0asemi-sextarii of whey. The liver or lights of a fox, taken in %0ared wine, or bear’s gall in water, facilitate the respiration. %0a%0aCHAP. 56. -REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE LOINS. %0a%0aFor pains in the loins and all other affections which require %0aemollients, frictions with bears’ grease should be used ; or else %0aashes of stale boars’ dung or swine’s dung should be mixed %0awith wine and given to the patients. The magicians, too, %0ahave added to this branch of medicine their own fanciful %0adevices. In the first place of all, madness in he-goats, they %0asay, may be effectually calmed by stroking the beard ; and if %0athe beard is cut off, the goat will never stray to another flock. %0a%0a53 Asses’ milk is still recommended for pulmonary phthisis. %0a%0a63 See B. viii. c. 16. %0a%0a%0aCliap. 57.] EEMEDIES FOE AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. 345 %0a%0aTo the above composition they add goats’ dung, and recom¬ %0amend it to be held in the hollow of the hand, as hot as possible, %0aa greased linen cloth being placed beneath, and care being %0ataken to hold it in the right hand if the pain is on the left %0aside, and in the left hand if the pain is on the right. They %0arecommend also that the dung employed for this purpose should %0abe taken up on the point of a needle made of copper. The %0amode of treatment is, for the patient to hold the mixture in %0ahis hand till the heat is felt to have penetrated to the loins, %0aafter which the hand is rubbed with a pounded leek, and the %0aloins with the same dung annealed with honey. They prescribe %0aalso for the same malady the testes of a hare, to be eaten by the %0apatient. In cases of sciatica they are for applying cow-dung %0awarmed upon hot ashes in leaves : and for pains in the kidneys %0athey recommend a hare’s kidneys to be swallowed raw, or %0aperhaps boiled, but without letting them be touched by the %0ateeth. If a person carries about him the pastern-bone of a %0ahare, he will never be troubled with pains in the bowels, %0athey say. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. -EEMEDIES FOE AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. %0a%0aAffections of the spleen are alleviated by taking the gall of %0aa wild boar or hog in drink ; ashes of burnt deer’s horns in %0avinegar ; or, what is best of all, the dried spleen of an ass, the %0agood effects being sure to be felt in the course of three days. %0aThe first dung voided by an ass’s foal—a substance known as %0a“ polea” 60 by the people of Syria—is administered in oxymel %0afor these complaints; a dried horse tongue, too, is taken in %0awine, a sovereign remedy which, Caecilius Bion tells us, he first %0aheard of when living among the barbarous nations. The milt %0aof a cow or ox is used in a similar manner; but when it is %0aquite fresh, the practice is to roast or boil it and take it with %0athe food. For pains in the liver a topical application is made %0aby bruising twenty heads of garlick in one sextarius of vinegar, %0aand applying them in a piece of ox bladder. For the same %0amalady the magicians recommend a calf’s milt, bought at the %0aprice set upon it and without any haggling, that berng an %0aimportant point, and one that should be religiously observed. %0aThis done, the milt must be cut in two lengthwise, and attached %0a%0a60 This would appear to be a Greek word in reality. %0a%0a%0a.346 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII, %0a%0a%0ato the patient’s shirt, 61 on either side; after which, the patient %0amust put it on and let the pieces full at his feet, and must %0athen pick them up, and dry them in the shade. While this %0alast is doing, the diseased liver of the patient will gradually %0acontract, they say, and he will eventually be cured. The %0alights, too, of a fox are very useful for this purpose, dried on %0ahot ashes and taken in water; the same, too, with a kid’s %0amilt, applied to the part affected. %0a%0aCHAT. 58. (14.)- REMEDIES FOR BOWEL COMPLAINTS. %0a%0aTo arrest looseness of the bowels, deer’s blood is used ; the %0aashes also of deer’s horns ; the liver of a wild boar, taken fresh %0aand without salt, in wine ; a swine’s liver roasted, or that of a %0ahe-goat, boiled in five semisextarii of wine ; a hare’s rennet %0aboiled, in quantities the size of a chick-pea, in wine, or, if %0athere are symptoms of fever, in water. To this last some %0apersons add nut-galls, while others, again, content themselves %0awith hare’s blood boiled by itself in milk. Ashes, too, of %0aburnt horse-dung are taken in water for this purpose; or else %0aashes of the part of an old bull’s horn which lies nearest the %0aroot, sprinkled in water; the blood, too, of a he-goat boiled %0aupon charcoal; or a decoction made from a goat’s hide boiled %0awith the hair on. %0a%0aFor relaxing the bowels a horse’s rennet is used, or else the %0ablood, marrow, or liver of a she-goat. A similar effect is pro¬ %0aduced by applying a wolf’s gall to the navel, with elaterium; 0 %0aby taking mares’ milk, goats’ milk with salt and honey, or a %0ashe-goat’s gall with juice of cyclaminos, 63 and a little alum—in %0awhich last case some prefer adding nitre and water to the %0amixture. Bull’s gall, too, is used for a similar purpose, beaten %0aup with wormwood and applied in the form of a suppository; or %0abutter is taken, in considerable doses. %0a%0aCoeliac affections and dysentery are cured by taking cow’s %0aliver; ashes of deer’s horns, a pinch in three fingers swallowed %0ain water; hare’s rennet, kneaded up in bread, or, if there is %0aany discharge of blood, taken with polenta ; M or else boar’s %0a%0a61 “ Tunica.” 62 See B. xx. c. 2. %0a%0a63 See B. xxv. c. 67.

Among the remedies, also, for the %0acceliac flux and dysentery, veal broth is reckoned, a remedy very %0acommonly used. If the patient takes asses’ milk for these %0acomplaints, it will be all the better if honey is added; and no %0aless efficacious for either complaint are the ashes of asses’ dung %0ataken in wine ; or else polea, the substance above 65 -mentioned. %0aIn 6uch cases, even when attended with a discharge of blood, %0awe find a horse’s rennet recommended, by some persons known %0aas “hippace;” ashes of burnt horse-dung; horses’ teeth %0apounded; and boiled cows’ milk. In cases of dysentery, it is %0arecommended to add a little honey ; and, for the cure of grip¬ %0aing pains, ashes of deer’s horns, bull’s gall mixed with cum¬ %0amin, or the flesh of a gourd, should be applied to the navel. %0aFor both complaints new cheese made of cows’ milk is used, %0aas an injection; butter also, in the proportion of four serni- %0asextarii to two ounces of turpentine, or else employed with a de¬ %0acoction of mallows or with oil of roses. Veal-suet or beef-suet %0ais also given, and the marrow of those animals is boiled with %0ameal, a little wax, and some oil, so as to form a sort of pottage. %0aThis marrow, too, is kneaded up with bread for a similar pur¬ %0apose; or else goats’ milk is used, boiled down to one half. In %0acases, too, where there are gripings in the bowels, wine of the %0afirst running 60 is administered. For the last-named pains, some %0apersons are of opinion that it is a sufficient remedy to take %0aa single dose of hare’s rennet in mulled wine; though others %0aagain, who are more distrustful, are in the habit of applying a %0aliniment to tbe abdomen, made of goats’ blood, barley-meal, %0aand resin. %0a%0aFor all defluxions of the bowels it is recommended to apply %0a6oft cheese, aud for cceliac affections and dysentery old cheese, %0apowdered, one cyathus of cheese being taken in three cyathi of %0aordinary wine. Goats’ blood is boiled down with the marrow %0aof those animals for the cure of dysentery ; and the cceliac flux %0ais effectually treated with the roasted liver of a she-goat, or, %0awhat is still better, the liver of a he-goat boiled in astringent %0awine, and administered in the drink, or else applied to the navel %0awith oil of myrtle. Some persons boil down the liver in three %0aBextarii of water to half a sextarius, and then add rue to it. %0a%0a65 In Chap. 57 of this Book. %0a%0a06 i* Protropum.” See B. xiv. cc. 9. 11. %0a%0a%0a348 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history.

This last, however, must be taken %0aby itself and swallowed immediately, being generally recom¬ %0amended to be taken in water moderately cool. Some persons, %0atoo, boil goats’ suet in water, with a mixture of polenta, cum¬ %0amin, anise, and vinegar; and for the cure of coeliac affections, %0athey rub the abdomen with a decoction of goats’ dung and %0ahoney. %0a%0aFor both the coeliac flux and dysentery, kid’s rennet is %0aemployed, taken in myrtle wine in pieces the size of a bean, %0aor else kid’s blood, prepared in the form of a dish known by %0athe name of “ sanguiculus.” 67 For dysentery an injection is %0aemployed, made of bull glue dissolved in warm water. Flatu¬ %0alency is dispelled by a decoction of calf’s dung in wine. For %0aintestinal affections deer’s rennet is highly recommended, %0aboiled with beef and lentils, and taken with the food; hare’s %0afur, also reduced to ashes and boiled with honey; or boiled %0agoat’s milk, taken with a small quantity of mallows and some %0asalt; if rennet is added, the remedy will be all the more effec¬ %0atual. Goat suet, taken in any kind of broth, is possessed of %0asimilar virtues, care being taken to swallow cold water imme¬ %0adiately after. The ashes of a kid’s thighs are said to be mar¬ %0avellously efficacious for intestinal hernia ; as also hare’s dung, %0aboiled with honey, and taken daily in pieces the size of a bean; %0aindeed, these remedies are said to have proved effectual in cases %0aAvhere a cure has been quite despaired of.

The antler of a young stag, %0areduced to ashes and taken in wine, mixed with African snails', %0acrushed with the shells on, is considered a very useful remedy. %0a%0aCHAI>. 60. (15.)- KEHEDIES FOB AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDEE, %0a%0aAND FOB UBINAEY CALCULI. %0a%0aDiseases of the bladder, and the torments attendant upon %0acalculi, are treated with the urine of a wild boar, or the %0abladder of that animal taken as food; both of them being still %0amore efficacious if they have been thoroughly soaked first. %0aThe bladder, when eaten, should be boiled first, and if the %0apatient is a female, it should be a sow’s bladder. There are %0afound in the liver of the wild boar certain small stones, 72 or %0awhat in hardness resemble small stones, of a white hue, and %0aresembling those found in the liver of the common swine: if %0athese stones are pounded and taken in wine, they will expel %0acalculi, it is said. So oppressed is the wild boar by the bur¬ %0aden of his urine, 73 that if he has not first voided it, he is %0aunable to take to flight, and suffers himself to be taken as %0athough he were enchained to the spot. This urine, they say, %0ahas a consuming effect upon urinary calculi. The kidneys of %0aa hare, dried and taken in wine, act as an expellent upon %0acalculi. We have already 74 mentioned that in the gammon of %0athe hog there are certain joint-bones; a decoction made from %0athem is remarkably useful for urinary affections. The kidneys %0aof an ass, dried and pounded, and administered in undiluted %0airiue, are a cure for diseases of the bladder. The excrescences %0athat grow on horses’ legs, taken for forty days in ordinary %0awine or honied wine, expel urinary calculi.

Running ulcers of those parts are %0atreated with veal-suet and marrow, boiled in wine, or with the %0agall of a she-goat, mixed with honey and the extracted juice %0aof the bramble. 76 In cases where these ulcers are serpiginous, %0ait is recommended to use goats’ dung with honey or vinegar, %0aor else butter by itself. Swellings of the testes are reduced by %0ausing veal-suet with nitre, or the dung of the animal boiled in %0avinegar. The bladder of a wild boar, eaten roasted, acts as a %0acheck upon incontinence of urine; a similar effect being pro¬ %0aduced by the ashes of the feet of a wild boar or swine sprinkled %0ain the drink; the ashes of a sow’s bladder taken in drink; the %0abladder or lights of a kid ; a hare’s brains taken in wine; the %0atestes of a male hare grilled ; the rennet of that animal taken %0a-with goose-grease and polenta ; 77 or the kidneys of an ass, beaten %0aup and taken in undiluted wine. %0a%0aThe magicians tell us, that after taking the ashes of a boar’s %0agenitals in sweet wine, the patient must make -water in a dog %0akennel, and repeat the following formula—“ This I do that I %0amay not wet my bed as a dog does.” On the other hand, a %0aswine’s bladder, attached to the groin, facilitates the discharge %0aof the urine, provided it has not already touched the ground. %0a%0aCHAP. 61. —REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS %0aAND OF THE FUNDAMENT. %0a%0aFor diseases of the fundament, a sovereign remedy is bear’s %0agall, mixed with the grease; to which some persons are in the %0a%0a75 Ajasson remarks that arsenic should be used with the greatest care in %0asuch a case. %0a%0a76 “ Rubi.” lie probably means the bramble-berry. %0a%0a77 See B. xviii. c. 14. %0a%0a%0aChap. 61.] REMEDIES FOR THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 351 %0a%0akbit of adding litharge and frankincense.

The pro¬ %0aportions in which they are mixed will be regulated by the %0acircumstances of the case, care being taken to see that they are %0aof a consistency which admits of their being easily applied. %0aBull’s gall upon lint is a remarkably useful, remedy, and has %0athe effect of making chaps of the fundament cicatrize with %0agreat rapidity. Swellings of those parts are treated with veal %0asuet—that from the loins in particular—mixed with rue. For %0aother affections, goats’ blood is used, with polenta. Goats’ %0agall, too, is employed by itself, for the cure of condylomata, and %0asometimes, wolf’s gall, mixed with wine. %0a%0aBears’ blood is curative of inflamed tumours and apost- %0aemes upon these parts in general; as also bulls’ blood, dried %0aand powdered. The best remedy, however, is considered to %0abe the stone which the wild ass 78 voids with his urine, it is %0asaid, at the moment he is killed. This stone, which is in a %0asomewhat liquefied state at first, becomes solid when it reaches %0athe ground : attached to the thigh, it disperses all collections %0aof humours and all kinds of suppurations: it is but rarely %0afound, however, and it is not every wild ass that produces it, %0abut as a remedy it is held in high esteem. Asses’ urine too, %0aused in combination with gith, is highly recommended; the %0aashes of a horse’s hoof, applied with oil and water; a horse’s %0ablood, that of a stone-horse in particular ; the blood, also, of an %0aox or cow, or the gall of those animals. Their flesh too, applied %0awarm, is productive of similar results; the hoofs reduced to %0aashes, and taken in water or honey; the urine of a she-goat; %0athe flesh of a he-goat, boiled in water; the dung of these %0aanimals, boiled with honey; or else a boar’s gall, or swine’s %0aurine, applied in wool. %0a%0aRiding on horseback, we well know, galls and chafes the %0ainside of the thighs: the best remedy for accidents of this %0anature is to rub the parts with the foam which collects at a %0ahorse’s mouth.

Others, again, %0aprefer he-goat suet, mixed with the dung of a she-goat and %0asaffron, or else with mustard, or sprigs of ivy pounded and %0aused with perdicium , 81 or with flowers of wild cucumber. Cow- %0adung is also used, with lees of vinegar. Some persons speak %0ahighly in praise of the dung of a calf which has not begun to %0agraze, or else a bull’s blood, without any other addition; a %0afox, also, boiled alive till only the bones are left; a wolf boiled %0aalive in oil to the consistency of a cerate ; he-goat suet, with %0aan equal proportion of helxine , 82 and one-third part of mus¬ %0atard ; or ashes of goats’ dung, mixed with axle-grease. They %0asay, too, that for sciatica, it is an excellent plan to apply this %0adung boiling 83 hot beneath the great toes ; and that, for diseases %0aof the joints, it is highly efficacious to attach bears’ gall or %0ahares’ feet to the part affected. Gout, they say, may be allayed %0aby the patient always carrying about with him a hare’s foot, %0acut off from the animal alive. %0a%0aBears’ grease is a cure for chilblains and all kinds of chaps %0aupon the feet; with the addition of alum, it is still more effi¬ %0acacious. The same results are produced by using goat-suet; %0aa horse’s teeth powdered ; the gall of a wild boar or hog; or %0aelse the lights of those animals, applied with their grease; and %0athis, too, where the soles are blistered, or the feet have been %0acrushed by a substance striking against them. In cases where %0athe feet have been frozen, ashes of burnt hare’s fur are used; %0aand for contusions of the feet, the lights of that animal are %0aapplied, sliced or reduced to ashes.' Blisters occasioned by the %0asun are most effectually treated by using asses’ fat, or else %0abeef-suet, with oil of roses.

Corns are treated with beef-suet and pow¬ %0adered frankincense ; chilblains with burnt leather, that of an %0aold shoe, in particular ; and injuries produced by tight shoes %0awith ashes of goat-skin, tempered with oil. %0a%0aThe pains attendant upon varicose veins are mitigated by %0ausing ashes of burnt calves’ dung, boiled with lily roots and a %0alittle honey : a composition which is equally good for all kinds %0aof inflammations and sores, that tend to suppurate. It is very %0auseful, also, for gout and diseases of the joints, when it is the %0adung of a bull-calf that is used more particularly. For exco¬ %0ariations of the joints, the gall of a wild boar or swine is applied, %0ain a warm linen cloth : the dung, also, of a calf that has not %0abegun to graze; or else goat-dung, boiled in vinegar with honey. %0aYeal-suet rectifies malformed nails, as also goat-suet, mixed with %0asandaraeh.

The testes, %0aalso, of swine are prescribed, dried and beaten up in sows’ %0amilk, the patient abstaining from wine some day's before and %0aafter taking the mixture. The lights of a hare, too, are recom¬ %0amended, salted, and taken with one third of frankincense, for %0athirty consecutive days, in white wine : hare’s rennet also ; %0aand asses’ brains, smoked with burning leaves, and adminis¬ %0atered in hydromel, in doses of half an ounce per day. An %0aass’s hoofs arc reduced to ashes, and taken for a month toge¬ %0ather, in doses of two spoonfuls; the testes, also, of an ass, %0asalted and mixed with the drink, asses’ milk or water in par¬ %0aticular. The secundines, also, of a she-ass are recommended, %0amore particularly when it is a male that has been foaled : placed %0abeneath the nostrils of the patient, when the fits are likely to %0acome on, this substance will effectually repel them. %0a%0aVOL. v. %0a%0a%0aA A %0a%0a%0a354 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Dook XXVIII. %0a%0a%0aThere are some persons who recommend the patient to eat %0athe heart of a black he-ass in the open air with bread, upon %0athe first or second day of the moon: others, again, prescribe %0athe flesh of that animal, and others the blood, diluted with %0avinegar, and taken for forty days together. Some mix horse- %0astale for this purpose, with smithy water fresh from the forge, %0aemploying the same mixture for the cure of delirium. Epilepsy %0ais also treated with mares’ milk, or the excrescences from a %0ahorse’s legs, taken in honey and vinegar.

There is one kind of fever gene¬ %0arally known as “ amphemerine ;” 87 it is to be cured, they say, %0aby the patient taking three drops of blood from an ass’s ear, and %0aswallowing them in two semi-sextarii of water.

Who , 89 pray, could have ever made such a %0adiscovery as this ? And what, too, can be the meaning of this %0acombination ? Why, of all things in the world, was the toe %0aof a horned owl made choice of? %0a%0aOther adepts in this art, who are more moderate in their %0asuggestions, recommend for quartan fever, the salted liver of a %0acat that has been killed while the moon was on the wane, to be %0ataken in wine just before the paroxysms come on. The ma¬ %0agicians recommend, too, that the toes of the patient should be %0arubbed with the ashes of burnt cow-dung, diluted with a boy’s %0aurine, and that a hare’s heart should be attached to the hands; %0athey prescribe, also, hare’s rennet, to be taken in drink just %0abefore the paroxysms come on.

The %0aashes, too, of burnt cow-dung, and of bulls’ dung in particular %0a—animals that are reared in herds, I mean—are highly esteemed. %0aThis dung, the name given to which is “ bolbiton ,” 95 is re¬ %0aduced to ashes, and taken in doses of three spoonfuls to one %0asemisextarius of honied wine; that of the female animal being %0aused where the patient is a woman, and that of the other sex %0ain the case of males; a distinction about which the magicians %0ahave made a sort of grand mystery. The dung of a bull-calf is %0aalso applied topically for this disease, and ashes of burnt calves’ %0adung are taken with seed of staphylinos , 96 in equal proportions, %0ain wine.

For swellings, swine’s %0adung is used, warmed in an earthen pot, and beaten up with %0aoil. The best emollient for all kinds of indurations upon the %0abody is wolf’s fat, applied topically. In the case of sores %0awhich are wanted to break, the most effectual plan is to apply %0acow-dung warmed in hot ashes, or else goats’ dung boiled in %0avinegar or wine. For the cure of boils, beef-suet is applied %0awith salt; but if they are attended with pain, it is melted with %0aoil, and no salt is used. Goat-suet is employed in a similar %0amanner. %0a%0aCHAP. 71.— REMEDIES FOR BURNS.

The Rhodian glue is the purest of all, %0aand it is this that painters and physicians mostly use.

Strains %0aand contusions are healed Avith wild boars’ dung, that has been %0agathered in spring and dried. A similar method is employed %0awhere persons have been dragged by a chariot or lacerated by %0athe wheels, or have received contusions in any other Avay, the %0aapplication being quite as effectual, should the dung happen %0ato be fresh. Some think it a better plan, however, to boil it %0ain vinegar ; and if only powdered and taken in vinegar, they %0avouch for its good effects Avhere persons are ruptured, wounded %0ainternally, or suffering from the effects of a fall. %0a%0aOthers again, who are of a more scrupulous tendency , 99 take %0athe ashes of it in Avater ; and the Emperor Nero, it is said, was %0ain the habit of refreshing himself Avith this drink, Avhen he at¬ %0atempted to gain the public applause at the three-horse chariot %0araces . 1 Swine’s dung, it is generally thought, is the next %0abest to that of the goat. %0a%0aCHAP. 73.

The dung, however, of male animals is the %0amost efficacious for this purpose, being mixed with vinegar, and %0aapplied with avooI, in all cases of haemorrhage. In the same way, %0atoo, the ashes of a horse’s head or thigh, or of burnt calves’ dung, %0aare used with A T inegar ; the ashes also of a goat’s horns or dung, %0a%0a98 "Where the sinew has been wounded and exposed, either vinegar or %0ahoney, Ajasson remarks, Avould be a highly dangerous application. ° %0a%0a99 “ Keverentiores.” 1 “ Trigario.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 74.] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES FOR ULCERS. %0a%0a%0a359 %0a%0a%0awith vinegar. But it is the thick blood that issues from the %0aliver of a he-goat when cut asunder, that is looked upou as the %0amost efficacious ; or else ihe ashes of the burnt liver of a goat %0aof either sex, taken in wine or applied to the nostrils with %0avinegar. The ashes, too, of a leather wine-bottle—but only %0awhen made of he-goat skin—are used very efficiently witti %0aan equal quantity of resin, for the purpose of stanching blood, %0aand knitting together the lips of the wound. A kid’s rennet %0ain vinegar, or the thighs of that animal, reduced to ashes, are %0asaid to be productive of a similar result. %0a%0aCHAP. 74.-REMEDIES FOR ULCERS AND CARCINOMATOUS SORES. %0a%0aUlcers upon the legs and thighs are cured by an application %0aof bears’ grease, mixed with red earth : and those of a serpigi¬ %0anous nature by using wild boar’s gall, with resin and white %0alead; the jaw-bone of a wild boar or swine, reduced to ashes ; %0aswine’8 dung in a dry state; or goats’ dung, made luke-warm %0ain vinegar. For other kinds of ulcers butter is used, as a %0adetergent, and as tending to make new flesh; ashes of deer’s %0aantlers, or deer’s marrow ; or else bull’s gall, mixed with %0aoil of Cyprus 2 or oil of iris. Wounds inflicted with edged %0aweapons are .rubbed with fresh swine’s dung, or with dried %0aswine’s dung, powdered. When ulcers are phagedaenic or %0afistulous, bull’s gall is injected, with leek-juice or woman’s %0amilk; or else bull’s blood, dried and powdered, with the plant %0acotyledon. 3 %0a%0aCarcinomatous sores are treated with hare’s rennet, sprin¬ %0akled upon them with an equal proportion of capers in wine; %0agangrenes, with bears’ grease, applied with a feather; and %0aulcers of a serpiginous nature with the ashes of an ass’s hoofs, %0apowdered upon them. The blood of the horse cqrrodes the %0ailesh by virtue of certain septic powers which it possesses; %0adried horse-dung, too, reduced to ashes, has a similar effect. %0aThose kinds of ulcers which are commonly known as “phage¬ %0adaenic,” are treated with the ashes of a cow’s hide, mixed with %0ahoney. Calves’ flesh, as also cow-dung mixed with honey, pre¬ %0avents recent wounds from swelling. The ashes of a leg of veal, %0aapplied with woman’s milk, are a cure for sordid ulcers, and the %0amalignant sore known as “ cacoethes :” 4 bull-glue, melted, is %0a%0a2 See B. xii. c. 51. 3 See B. xxv. c. 101. %0a%0a* “ Bad habit."

Dried %0agoats’ milk cheese, applied with vinegar and honey, acts as a %0adetergent upon ulcers; and goat suet, used in combination %0awith wax, arrests the spread of serpiginous sores : if employed %0awith pitch and sulphur, it will effect a thorough cure. The %0aashes of a kid’s leg, applied with woman’s milk, have a similar %0aeffect upon malignant ulcers; for the cure, too, of carbuncles, a %0asow’s brains are roasted and applied. %0a%0aCHAP. 75. -REMEDIES FOR THE ITCH. %0a%0aThe itch in man is cured very effectually by using the %0amarrow of an ass, or the urine of that animal, applied with %0athe mud it has formed upon the ground. Butter, too, is very %0agood ; as also in the case of beasts of burden, if applied with %0awarmed resin : bull glue is also used, melted in vinegar, aud %0aincorporated with lime; or goat’s gall, mixed -with calcined %0aalum. The eruption called “ boa,” 4 is treated with cow-dung, %0aa fact to which it is indebted for its name. The itch in dogs %0ais cured by an application of fresh cows’ blood, which, when %0aquite dry, is renewed a second time, and is rubbed off the next %0aday with strong lie-ashes. %0a%0aCHAP. 76. -METHODS OF EXTRACTING FOREIGN SUBSTANCES WHICH %0a%0aADHERE TO THE BODY, AND OF RESTORING SCARS TO THEIK %0a%0aNATURAL COLOUR. %0a%0aThoms and similar foreign substances are extracted from the %0abody by using cats’ dung, or that of she-goats, with wine ; the %0arennet also of any kind of animal, that of the hare more parti¬ %0acularly, with powdered frankincense and oil, or an equal quan¬ %0atity of mistletoe, or else with bee-glue. 6 %0a%0aAss suet restores scars of a swarthy hue to their natural %0acolour; and they are equally effaced by using calf’s gall made %0awarm. Medical men add myrrh, honey, and saffron, and keep %0athe mixture in a copper box; some, too, incorporate with it %0aflower of copper. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. (19.)- REMEDIES FOR FEMALE DISEASES. %0a%0aMenstruation is promoted by using bull’s gall, in unwashed %0awool, as a pessary : Olympias of Thebes adds hyssop and nitre. %0as See B. xxiv. c. 35. 6 “ Propolis.” See B. xi. c. 6. %0a%0a%0aChap. 77.] REMEDIES FOR FEMALE DISEASES. 361 %0a%0aAshes, too, of deer’s horns are taken in drink for the same pur¬ %0apose, and for derangements of the uterus they are applied topi¬ %0acally, as also bull’s gall, used as a pessary with opium, in the %0aproportion of two oboli. It is a good plan, too, to use fumigations %0afor the uterus, made with deer’s hair, burnt. Hinds, they say, %0awhen they find themselves pregnant, are in the habit of swal¬ %0alowing a small stone. This stone, when found in their excre-'^ %0ainents, or in the uterus—for it is to be found there as well— %0aattached to the body as an amulet, is a preventive of abortion. %0aThere are also certain small stones, found in the heart and uterus %0aof these animals, which are very useful for women during preg¬ %0anancy and in travail. As to the kind of pumice-stone which %0ais similarly found in thg uterus of the cow, we have already 7 %0amentioned it when treating of the formation of that animal. %0a%0aA wolf’s fat, applied externally, acts emolliently upon the %0auterus, and the liver of a wolf is very soothing for pains in %0athat organ. It is found advantageous for women, w r hen near %0adelivery, to eat wolf’s flesh, or, if they are in travail, to have %0aa person near them who has eaten it; so much so, indeed, that %0ait will act as a countercharm even to any noxious spells which %0amay have been laid upon them. In case, however, a person %0awho has eaten wolf’s flesh should happen to enter the room %0aat the moment of parturition, dangerous effects will be sure to %0afollow. The hare, too, is remarkably useful for the complaints %0aof females: the lights of that animal, dried and taken in drink, %0aare beneficial to the uterus; the liver, taken in waterwith Samian ' %0aearth, acts as an emmenagogue; and the rennet brings away %0athe after-birth, due care being taken by the patient not to bathe %0athe day before. Applied in wool as a pessary, with saffron and %0aleek-juice, this last acts as an expellent upon the dead foetus. It %0ais a general opinion that the uterus of a hare, taken with the %0afood, promotes the conception of male offspring, and that a %0asimilar effect is produced by using the testes and rennet of that %0aanimal. It is thought, too, that a leveret, taken from the uterus %0aof its dam, is a restorative of fruitfulness to women who are %0aotherwise past child-bearing. Eut it is the blood of a hare’s %0afoetus that the magicians recommend males to drink: while for %0ayoung girls they prescribe nine pellets of hare’s dung, to ensure p %0aa durable firmness to the breasts. For a similar purpose, also, %0a%0a7 In 13. xi. c. 79. %0a%0a%0a62 %0a%0a%0aflint’s NATUItAL 1IIST0HT. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII. %0a%0a%0athey apply hare’s rennet with honey; and to prevent hairs %0afrom growing again when once removed, they use a liniment %0aof hare’s blood. %0a%0aFor inflations of the uterus, it is found a good plan to apply %0a~ wild boars’ dung or swine’s dung topically with oil: but a %0a~ still more effectual remedy is to dry the dung, and sprinkle it, %0apowdered, in the patient’s drink, even though she should be %0ain a state of pregnancy or suffering the pains of child-birth. %0aBy administering sow’s milk with honied wine, parturition is %0afacilitated ; and if taken by itself it will promote the secre¬ %0ation of the milk when deficient in nursing women. By rub¬ %0abing the breasts of famales with sow’s blood they are pre¬ %0avented from becoming too large. If pains are felt in the %0abreasts, they will be alleviated by drinking asses’ milk; and the %0asame milk, taken with honey, has considerable efficacy as an %0a— emmenagogue. Stale fat, too, from the same animal, heals %0aulcerations of the uterus : applied as a pessary, in wool, it acts %0aemolliently upon indurations of that organ ; and, applied fresh %0a^ by itself, or in water when stale, it has all the virtues of a %0adepilatory. %0a%0aAn ass’s milt, dried and applied in water to the breasts, %0apromotes the secretion of the milk; and used in the form of a %0afumigation, it acts as a corrective upon the uterus. A fumi¬ %0agation made with a burnt ass’s hoof, placed beneath a woman, %0aaccelerates parturition, so much so, indeed, as to expel the dead %0afoetus even : hence it is that it should only be employed in cases %0aof miscarriage, it having a fatal effect upon the living foetus. %0a%0a• Asses’ dung, applied fresh, has a wonderful effect, they say, in %0aarresting discharges of blood in females : the same, too, with %0a%0a■ the ashes of this dung, which, used as a pessary, are very good %0afor the uterus. If the skin is rubbed with the foam from a %0ahorse’s mouth for forty days together, before the first hair has %0amade its appearance, it will effectually prevent the growth %0athereof: a decoction, too, made from deer’s antlers is productive %0aof a similar effect, being all the better if they are used quite %0afresh. Mares’ milk, used as an injection, is highly beneficial %0ato the uterus. %0a%0aWhere the foetus is felt to be dead in the uterus, the %0alichens or excrescences from a horse’s legs, taken in fresh %0awater, will act as an expellent: an effect produced also by a %0a%0a■ fumigation made with the hoofs or dry dung of that animal. %0a%0a%0aChap. 77.] KEMEDIES FOE FEMALE DISEASES. 36'3 %0a%0aProcidence of the uterus is arrested by using butter, in the %0aform of an injection ; and indurations of that organ are removed %0aby similarly employing ox-gall, with oil of roses, turpentine %0abeing applied externally in wool. They say, too, that a fumi¬ %0agation, made from ox-dung, acts as a corrective upon procidence %0aof the uterus, and facilitates parturition; and that conception %0ais promoted by the use of cows’ milk. It is a well-known %0afact that sterility is often entailed by suffering in child-birth ; %0aan evil which may be averted, Olympias of Thebes assures us, %0aby rubbing the parts, before sexual intercourse, with bull’s %0agall, serpents’ fat, verdigrease, and honey. In cases, too, where %0amenstruation is too abundant, the external parts should be %0asprinkled with a solution of calf’s gall, the moment before the %0asexual congress; a method which acts emolliently also upon %0aindurations of the abdomen. Applied to the navel as a lini¬ %0ament, it arrests excessive discharges, and is generally beneficial %0ato the uterus. The proportions generally adopted are—-one %0adenarius of gall, one-third of a denarius of opium, and as much %0aoil of almonds as may appear to be requisite; the whole being %0aapplied in sheep’s wool. The gall, too, of a bull-calf is beaten %0aup with half the quantity of honey, and kept in readiness for %0athe treatment of uterine diseases. If a woman about the time %0aof conception eats roasted veal with the plant aristolochia, 8 she %0awill bring forth a male child, we are assured. Calf’s marrow, %0aboiled in wine and water with the suet, and applied as a pes¬ %0asary, is good for ulcerations of the uterus ; the same, too, with %0afoxes’ fat and cats’ dung, the last being applied with resin and %0aoil of roses. %0a%0aIt is considered a remarkably good plan to subject the uterus %0ato fumigations made with burnt goats’horns. The blood of %0athe wild goat, mixed with sea-palm, 9 acts as a depilatory. The %0agall of the other kinds of goat, used as an injection, acts %0aemolliently upon callosities of the uterus, and ensures concep¬ %0ation immediately after menstruation: it possesses also the %0avirtues of a depilatory, the application being left for three days %0aupon the flesh after the hair has been removed. The midwives %0aassure us that she-goats’ urine, taken in drink, and the dung, %0aapplied topically, will arrest uterine discharges, however %0amuch in excess. The membrane in which the kid is en¬ %0aclosed in the uterus, dried and taken in wine, acts as an expei- %0a8 See 13. xxv. cc. 79, 84, 91. 9 See B. xiii. c. 49. %0a%0a%0a364 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXVIII, %0a%0a%0alent upon the after-birth. For affections of the uterus, it is %0athought a desirable plan to fumigate it with burnt kids’ hair; %0aaud for discharges of blood, kids’ rennet is administered in %0adrink, or seed of henbane is applied. According to Osthanes, %0aif a woman’s loins are rubbed with blood taken from the ticks %0aupon a black wild bull, she will be inspired with an aversion to %0asexual intercourse : she will forget, too, her former love, by %0ataking a lie-goat’s urine in drink, some nard being mixed with %0ait to disguise the loathsome taste. %0a%0aCHAP. 78. -REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS. %0a%0aFor infants there is nothing more useful than butter, 10 cither %0aby itself or in combination with honey; for dentition more %0aparticularly, for soreness of the gums, and for ulcerations of %0athe mouth. A wolf’s tooth, attached to the body, prevents %0ainfants from being startled, and acts as a preservative against %0athe maladies attendant upon dentition; an effect equally %0aproduced by making use of a wolf’s skin. The larger teeth, %0aalso, of a wolf, attached to a horse’s neck, will render him %0aproof against all weariness, it is said. A hare’s rennet, applied %0ato the breasts of the nurse, effectually prevents diarrhoea in %0athe infant suckled by her. An ass’s liver, mixed with a little %0apanax, and dropped into the mouth of an infant, will preserve %0ait from epilepsy and other diseases to which infants are liable; %0athis, however, must be done for forty days, they say. An ass’s %0askin, too, thrown over infants, renders them insensible to fear. %0aThe first teeth shed by a horse, attached as an amulet to infants, %0afacilitate dentition, and are better still, when not allowed to %0atouch the ground. For pains in the spleen, an ox’s milt is ad¬ %0aministered in honey, and applied topically'; and for running %0aulcers it is used as an application, with honey. A calf’s milt, %0aboiled in wine, is beaten up, and applied to incipient ulcers %0aof the mouth. %0a%0aThe magicians take the brains of a she-goat, and, after passing %0athem through a gold ring, drop them into the mouth of the in¬ %0afant before it takes the breast, as a preservative against epilepsy %0aand other infantile diseases. Goats’ dung, attached to in¬ %0afants in a piece of cloth, prevents them from being rest¬ %0aless, female infants in particular. By rubbing the gums of %0a%0a10 There is probably some truth in these statements as to the utility of %0abutter and honey for infants. %0a%0a%0aChap. 80.] STIMULANTS FOR THE SEXUAL PASSIONS. %0a%0a%0a365 %0a%0a%0ainfants with goats’ milk or hare’s brains, dentition is greatly %0afacilitated. %0a%0a%0aCIIAI*. 79.-PROVOCATIVES OF SLEEP. %0a%0aCato was of opinion that hare’s flesh, 11 taken as a diet, is %0aprovocative of sleep. It is a vulgar notion, too, that this diet %0aconfers beauty for nine days on those who use it; a silly play 13 %0aupon words, no doubt, but a notion which has gained far too %0aextensively not to have had some real foundation. According %0ato the magicians, the gall of a she-goat, but only of one that %0ahas been sacrificed, applied to the eyes or placed beneath the %0apillow, has a narcotic effect. Too profuse perspiration is %0achecked by rubbipg the body with ashes of burnt goats’ horns %0amixed with oil of myrtle. %0a%0aCHAP. 80.—STIMULANTS FOR THE SEXUAL PASSIONS. %0a%0aAmong the aphrodisiacs, we find mentioned, a wild boar’s %0agall, applied externally; swine’s marrow, taken inwardly; %0aasses’ fat, mixed with the grease of a gander and applied as a %0aliniment; the virulent substance described by Virgil 13 as dis¬ %0atilling from mares when oovered; and the dried testes of a %0ahorse, pulverized and mixed with the drink. The right testicle, %0aalso, of an ass, is taken in a proportionate quantity of wine, or worn %0aattached to the arm in a bracelet; or else the froth discharged %0aby that animal after covering, collected in a piece of red cloth %0aand enclosed in silver, as Osthanes informs us. Salpe recom¬ %0amends the genitals of this animal to be plunged seven times in %0aboiling oil, and the corresponding parts to be well rubbed %0atherewith. Eialcon 14 says that these genitals should be reduced %0ato ashes and taken in drink ; or else the urine that has been %0avoided by a bull immediately after covering: he recommends, %0aalso, that the groin should be well rubbed with earth moistened %0awith this urine. %0a%0a11 Ajasson explains this by saying that the hare being eaten by the people %0aof ancient Latium on festival days, with plenteous potations, they erro¬ %0aneously supposed the narcotic effects of the wine to be produced by the %0aflesh of the hare. %0a%0a12 The resemblance of “ lepos,” “grace,” to “ lepus,” “ a hare.” Seo %0aMartial, B. v.

The lights of a wild boar or %0aswine, roasted, are an effectual preservative against drunken¬ %0aness ; they must, however, be eaten fasting, and upon the %0asame day. The lights of a kid, too, are productive of the %0a6am e effect. %0a%0aCHAP. 81. (20.)- REMARKABLE FACTS RELATIVE TO ANIMALS. %0a%0aIn addition to those already mentioned, there are various %0aother marvellous facts related, with reference to these animals. %0aWhen a horse-shoe becomes detached from the hoof, as often %0ais the case, if a person takes it up and puts it by, it will act as %0aa remedy for hiccup the moment he calls to mind the spot %0awhere he has placed it. A wolf’s liver, they say, is similar to %0aa horse’s hoof in appearance ; and a horse, they tell us, if %0ait follows in the track of a wolf, will burst 15 asunder beneath %0aits rider.. The pastern-bones of swine have a certain tendency %0ato promote discord, it is said. In cases of fire, if some of the %0adung can be brought away from the stalls, both sheep and %0aoxen may be got out all the more easilyq and will make no at¬ %0atempt to retuni. The flesh of a lie-goat will lose its rank %0asmell, if the animal has eaten barley-bread, or drunk an in¬ %0afusion of laser 16 the day on which it was killed. Meat that %0ahas been salted while the moon was on the wane, will never %0abe attacked by worms. In fact, so great has been the care %0ataken to omit no possible researches, that a deaf hare, we find, %0awill grow fat 17 sooner than one that can hear! %0a%0aAs to the remedies for the diseases of animals—If a beast of %0aburden voids blood, an injection must be used of swine’s dung %0amixed with wine. For the maladies of oxen, a mixture of suet %0a1 $ used with quicksilver, and wild garlic boiled ; the whole %0abeaten up and administered in wine. The fat, too, of a fox %0ais employed. The liquor of boiled horse-flesh, administered in %0atheir drink, is recommended for the cure of diseased swine: %0aand, indeed, the maladies of all four-footed beasts may be effec- %0a%0a15 He has already stated, in c. 44, that a horse will become torpid if it %0afollows in the track of a wolf; for which statement, according to Ajasson, %0athere appears to be some foundation. %0a%0a1S See B. xix. c. 15. %0a%0a17 This is not unlikely; for it has no alarms to make it grow thin. %0a%0a%0aChap. 81.] %0a%0a%0aSUMMARY. %0a%0a%0a367 %0a%0a%0atually treated by boiling a she-goat whole, in her skin, along %0a-with a bramble-frog. Poultry, they say, will never be touched %0aby a fox, if they have eaten the dried liver of that animal, or %0aif the cock, when treading the hen, has had a piece of fox’s %0askin about his neck. The same property, too, is attributed to %0aa weazel’s gall. The oxen in the Isle of Cyprus cure them¬ %0aselves of gripings in the abdomen, it is said, by swallowing 18 %0ahuman excrements : the feet, too, of oxen will never be worn %0ato the quick, if their hoofs are well rubbed with tar before %0athey begin work. Wolves will never approach a field, if, after %0aone has been caught and its legs broken and throat cut, the %0ablood is dropped little by little along the boundaries of the %0afield, and the body buried on the spot from which it was %0afirst dragged. The share, too, with which the first furrow %0ain the field has been traced in the current year, should be taken %0afrom the plough, and placed upon the hearth of the Lares, %0awhere the family is in the habit of meeting, and left there till %0ait is consumed : so long as this is in doing, uo wolf will attack %0aany animal in the field. %0a%0aWe will now turn to an examination of those animals which, %0abeing neither tame nor wild, are of a nature peculiar to them¬ %0aselves. %0a%0aSummary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, one %0athousand six hundred and eighty-two. %0a%0aRoman authors quoted. —M.Varro, 19 L.Piso, 20 Fabian us, 21 Va¬ %0alerius Antias, 22 Verrius Flaccus, 23 Cato the Censor, 24 Servius Sul- %0apicius, 25 Licinius Macer, 26 Celsus, 27 Massurius, 28 Sextius Niger 29 %0a%0a16 See B. viii. c. 41, as to a similar practice on the part of the panther. %0a%0a15 See end of B. ii. 211 See end of B. ii. %0a%0a21 For Fabianus Papirius, see end of B. ii.

(I.)-INTItODUCTIOH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wr should have now concluded our description of the various %0a%3c things 1 that are produced between the heavens and the earth, %0a%3c and it would have only remained for us to speak of the sub¬ %0a%3c stances that are dug out of the ground itself; did not our expo¬ %0a%3c sition of the remedies derived from plants and shrubs neces¬ %0a%3c sarily lead us into a digression upon the medicinal properties %0a%3c which have been discovered, to a still greater extent, in those %0a%3c living creatures themselves which are thus indebted [to other %0a%3c objects] for the cure of their respective maladies. For ought we, %0a%3c after describing the plants, the forms of the various flowers, and %0a%3c so many objects rare and difficult to be found—ought we to pass %0a%3c in silence the resources which exist in man himself for the %0a%3c benefit of man, and the other remedies to be derived from the %0a%3c creatures that live among us—and this more particularly, %0a%3c seeing that life itself is nothing short of a punishment, unless %0a%3c it is exempt from pains and maladies ? Assuredly not; and %0a%3c even though I may incur the risk of being tedious, I shall %0a%3c exert all my energies on the subject, it beiug my fixed deter¬ %0a%3c mination to pay less regard to what may be amusing, than to %0a%3c what may prove practically useful to mankind. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nay, even more than this, my researches will extend to the %0a%3c usages of foreign countries, and to the customs of barbarous %0a%3c nations, subjects upon which I shall have to appeal to the %0a%3c good faith of other authors ; though at the same time I have %0a%3c made it my object to select no 2 facts but such as are established %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The trees and plants. %0a%3c %0a%3c J On the contrary, this and the four following Books are full of the most %0a%3c eitravagant assertions, which bear ample testimony to his credulity, not¬ %0a%3c withstanding the author’s repeated declarations that he does not believe in %0a%3c Magic. As Ajasson says, he evidently does not know what he ought to %0a%3c have inserted in his work, and what to reject as utterly unworthy of belief. %0a%3c His faults, however, were not so much his own as those of his age. Want %0a%3c °t space, equally with want of inclination, compels us to forego the task of %0a%3c entering into an examination of the system of Animal Therapeutics upon %0a%3c ’diich so much labour has been wasted by our author. %0a%3c %0a%3c .

These additional details %0a%3c therefore, though of a different nature, must still be read in %0a%3c connexion with those whieh precede. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will begin then with man, and our first enquires will %0a%3c be into the resources which he provides for himself—a subject %0a%3c replete with boundless difficulties at the very outset. 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c Epileptic patients are in the habit of drinking the blood %0a%3c even of gladiators, draughts teeming with life, 1 as it were; a %0a%3c thing that, when we see it done by the wild beasts even, upon %0a%3c the same arena, inspires us with horror at the spectacle! And %0a%3c yet these persons, forsooth, consider it a most effectual cure %0a%3c for their disease, to quaff the warm, breathing, blood from man %0a%3c himself, and, as they apply their mouth to the wound, to draw %0a%3c forth his very life; and this, though it is regarded as an act %0a%3c of impiety to apply the human lips to the wound even of a %0a%3c wild beast! Others there are, again, who make the marrow 4 %0a%3c of the leg-bones, and the brains of infants, the objects of their %0a%3c research! %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the Greek writers, too, there are not a few who have %0a%3c enlarged upon the distinctive flavours of each one of the viscera %0a%3c and members of the human body, pursuing their researches %0a%3c to the very parings of the nails ! as though, forsooth, it could %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 See B. viii. c. 97, et seq., and B. xxv. c. 89, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 See B. xxviii. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 This practice is mentioned with reprobation by Celsus and Tertullian. %0a%3c It was continued, however, in some degree through the middle ages, and %0a%3c Louis XV. was accused by his people of taking baths of infants’ blood to %0a%3c repair his premature decrepitude. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 In recent times, Guettard, a French practitioner, recommended human %0a%3c marrow as an emollient liniment. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IChap. 2.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES DERIVED EDOM MAX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 77 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c possibly be accounted the pursuit of health for man to make %0a%3c himself a wild beast, and so deserve to contract disease from %0a%3c the very remedies he adopts for avoiding it. Most righteously, %0a%3c by Hercules! if such attempts are all in vain, is he disap¬ %0a%3c pointed of his cure ! To examine human entrails is deemed %0a%3c an net of impiety ; 6 * 8 what then must it be to devour them ? %0a%3c %0a%3c Say, Osthanes, 7 who was it that first devised these practices; %0a%3c for it is thee that I accuse, thou uprooter of all human laws, %0a%3c thou inventor of these monstrosities ; devised, no doubt, with %0a%3c the view that mankind might not forget thy name ! Who was %0a%3c it that first thought of devouring each member of the human %0a%3c body? By what conjectural motives was he induced ? What %0a%3c can possibly have been the origin of such a system of medicine as %0a%3c this? Who was it that thus made the very poisons less baneful %0a%3c than the antidotes prescribed for them ? Granted that barbarous %0a%3c and outlandish tribes first devised such practices, must the %0a%3c men of Greece, too, adopt these as arts of their own ? %0a%3c %0a%3c We read, for instance, in the memoirs of Democritus, still %0a%3c extant, that for some diseases, the skull of a malefactor is most %0a%3c efficacious, while for the treatment of others, that of one who %0a%3c has been a friend or guest is required. Apollonius, again, in¬ %0a%3c forms us in his writings, that the most effectual remedy for %0a%3c tooth-ache is to scarify the gums with the tooth of a man who %0a%3c has died a violent death; and, according to Miletus, human gall %0a%3c is a cure for cataract. 8 For epilepsy, Artemon has prescribed %0a%3c water drawn from a spring in the night, and drunk from the %0a%3c skull of a man who has been slain, and whose body remains %0a%3c unburnt. From the skull, too, of a man who had been hanged, %0a%3c Antrnus made pills that were to be an antidote to the bite of a %0a%3c mad dog. Even more than this, man has resorted to similar re¬ %0a%3c medies for the cure of four-footed beasts even—for tympanitis in %0a%3c oxen, for instance, the horns have been perforated, and human %0a%3c bones inserted ; and when swine have been found to be diseased, %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 Hence, as Ajasson remarks, the ignorance of anatomy displayed by the %0a%3c ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 For further particulars as to Osthanes, see B. xxix. c. 80, and B. xx.\. %0a%3c cc. 5 and 6; also cc. 19 and 77 of the present Book. The reading, how¬ %0a%3c ever, is very doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 “ Oculorum suffusiones.” As Ajasson says, the remedy here mentioned %0a%3c reminds us of the more harmless one used by Tobias for the cure of the %0a%3c blindness of his father Tobit. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c puny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 278 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c fine wheat has been given them which has lain for a night in %0a%3c the spot where a human being has been slain or burnt ! %0a%3c %0a%3c Far from us, far too from our writings, be such prescrip¬ %0a%3c tions 9 as these ! It will be for us to describe remedies only, %0a%3c and not abominations ; 10 cases, for instance, in which the milk %0a%3c of a nursing woman may have a curative effect, cases where %0a%3c the human spittle may be useful, or the contact 11 of the human %0a%3c body, and other instances of a similar nature. We donotlook %0a%3c upon life as so essentially desirable that it must be prolonged %0a%3c at any cost, be it what it may—and you, who are of that %0a%3c opinion, be assured, whoever you may be, that you will die %0a%3c none the less, even though you shall have lived in the midst %0a%3c of obscenities or abominations ! %0a%3c %0a%3c Let each then reckon this as one great solace to his mind, %0a%3c that of all the blessings whichNature has bestowed on man, %0a%3c there is none greater than the death 1 - which comes at a season¬ %0a%3c able hour; and that the very best feature in connexion with it %0a%3c is, that every person has it in his own power to procure it for %0a%3c himself. 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c CnAP. 3. (2.)- WHETHER WORDS ARE POSSESSED OF ANY %0a%3c %0a%3c HEALING EFFICACY. %0a%3c %0a%3c In reference to the remedies derived from man, there arises %0a%3c first of all one question, of the greatest importance and always %0a%3c attended with the same uncertainty, whether words, charms, %0a%3c and incantations, are of any efficacy or not? 14 For if such %0a%3c is the case, it will be only proper to ascribe this efficacy to %0a%3c man himself ; 15 though the wisest of our feUow T -men, I should %0a%3c remark, taken individually, refuse to place the slightest faith %0a%3c in these opinions. And yet, in our every-day life, we practi¬ %0a%3c cally show, each passing hour, that we do entertain this belief, %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 He gives a great many, however, which are equally abominable. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 *' Piacula.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 We may here discover the first rudiments of the doctrine of Animal %0a%3c Magnetism. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 In accordance with the republican doctrines of Cato of Utica, Brutus, %0a%3c Cassius, and Portia. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Holland remarks, “ Looke for no better divinitie in Plinie, a meere %0a%3c Pagan, Epicurean, and professed Atheist.” See B. vii. cc. 53, 54. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Whether or not, they cannot, as Ajasson remarks, be regarded as %0a%3c remedies derived from the human body, being no part of the human body. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 “ Homini acceptum fieri oportere conveniat.” This passage is pro¬ %0a%3c bably corrupt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 3.] WOETHEli WOIiDS AHE OF liEAEIKG EFFICACST. 2/9 %0a%3c %0a%3c though at the moment we are not sensible of it. Thus for %0a%3c instance, it is a general belief that without a certain form of %0a%3c prajer 18 it would be useless to immolate a victim, and that %0a%3c with such an informality, the gods would be consulted to little %0a%3c purpose. And then besides, there are different forms of %0a%3c address to the deities, one form for entreating, 17 another form for %0a%3c averting their ire, and another for commendation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ve see too, how that our supreme magistrates use certain %0a%3c formulae for their prayers: that not a single word may be %0a%3c omitted or pronounced out of its place, it is the duty of one %0a%3c peron to precede the dignitary by reading the formula before %0a%3c him from a written ritual, of another, to keep watch upon %0a%3c ever: word, and of a third to see that 18 silence is not ominously %0a%3c broken; while a musician, in the meantime, is performing on the %0a%3c fluteto prevent any other words being heard. 19 Indeed, there %0a%3c arenemorable instances recorded in our Annals, of cases where %0a%3c eithir the sacrifice has been interrupted, and so blemished, %0a%3c by iiprecations, or a mistake has been made in the utterance %0a%3c ofthtprayer; the result being that the lobe of the liver or %0a%3c the hurt has disappeared in a moment, or has been doubled, 20 %0a%3c while he victim stood before the altar. There is still in exist¬ %0a%3c ence amost remarkable testimony, 21 in the formula which the %0a%3c Decii,ather and son, pronounced on the occasions -when they %0a%3c devote themselves. 22 There is also preserved the prayer %0a%3c uttereeby the Vestal Tuccia, 23 when, upon being accused of %0a%3c incest, ie carried water in a sieve—an event which took place %0a%3c in the jar of the City 609.

First describing, on the ground before him, the outline %0a%3c of a temple with his staff—“ Is it so, Romans, as you say ?” %0a%3c said he; “here then must be the temple 29 of Jupiter, all good %0a%3c and all powerful; it is here that we have found the head”— %0a%3c and the constant asseveration of the Annals is, that the destiny %0a%3c of the Roman empire would have been assuredly transferred to %0a%3c Etruria, had not the deputies, forewarned by the son of the %0a%3c dimer, made answer—“ No, not here exactly, but at Rome, %0a%3c we say, the head was found.” %0a%3c %0a%3c It is related also that the same was the case when a certain %0a%3c four-horse chariot, made of clay, and intended for the roof of %0a%3c the same temple, had considerably increased while in the %0a%3c furnace ; 80 and that on this occasion, in a similar manner, the %0a%3c destinies of Rome were saved. Let these instances suffice %0a%3c then to show, that the virtues of presages lie in our own hands, %0a%3c and that they are valuable in each instance according as they %0a%3c are received. 31 At all events, it is a principle in the doctrine %0a%3c of the augurs, that neither imprecations nor auspices of any %0a%3c kind have any effect upon those who, when entering upon an %0a%3c undertaking, declare that they will pay no attention whatever %0a%3c to them; a greater instance than wffiich, of the indulgent dis¬ %0a%3c position of the gods towards us, cannot be found. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then besides, in the laws themselves of the Twelve %0a%3c Tables, do we not read the following words—“Whosoever shall %0a%3c have enchanted the harvest,” 32 and in another place, “ Whoso¬ %0a%3c ever shall have used pernicious incantations”? 33 Yerrius Flac- %0a%3c cus cites authors whom he deems worthy of credit, to show %0a%3c that on the occasion of a siege, it was the usage, the first thing of %0a%3c all, for the Roman priests to summon forth the tutelary divinity %0a%3c of that particular town, and to promise him the same rites, or %0a%3c even a more extended worship, at Rome; and at the present day %0a%3c even, this ritual still forms part of the discipline of our pontiffs. %0a%3c %0a%3c s * Ajasson thinks that there is an equivoque here upon the word “tern- %0a%3c plum,” which signified not only a building, but certain parts of the heavens, %0a%3c and corresponding lines traced on the earth by the augur’s staff. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 This story is mentioned by Plutarch, in the Life of Publicola. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 In which case it was considered necessary to repeat the words, “ Ac- %0a%3c cipio omen,” “ I accept the omen.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 “Qui fruges excantassit.” %0a%3c %0a%3c M “ Qui nudum carmen incantassit." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 282 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Rook XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is, no doubt, that the name 34 of the tutelary deity of %0a%3c Home has been so strictly kept concealed, lest any of our enemies %0a%3c should act in a similar manner. There is no one, too, who does %0a%3c not dread being spell-bound by means of evil imprecations ; 3t and %0a%3c hence the practice, after eating eggs or snails, of immedi¬ %0a%3c ately breaking 36 the shells, or piercing them with the spoon. %0a%3c Hence, too, those love-sick imitations of enchantments which %0a%3c we find described by Theocritus among the Greeks, and by %0a%3c Catullus, and more recently, Virgil , 37 among our own writers. %0a%3c Many persons are fully persuaded that articles .of pottery may %0a%3c be broken by a similar agency; and not a few are of opinion %0a%3c even that serpents can counteract incantations, and that this is %0a%3c the only kind of intelligence they possess—so much so, in fact, %0a%3c that by the agency of the magic spells of the Marsi, they may %0a%3c be attracted to one spot, even when asleep in the middle of the %0a%3c night. Some people go so far, too, as to write certain words 38 %0a%3c on the walls of houses, deprecatory of accident by fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c But it is not easy to say whether the outlandish and unpro¬ %0a%3c nounceable words that are thus employed, or the Latin ex¬ %0a%3c pressions that are used at random, and which must appear %0a%3c ridiculous to our judgment, tend the most strongly to stagger %0a%3c our belief—seeing that the human imagination is always con¬ %0a%3c ceiving something of the infinite, something deserving of the %0a%3c notice of the divinity, or indeed, to speak more correctly, some¬ %0a%3c thing that must command his intervention perforce. Homer 38 %0a%3c tells us that Ulysses arrested the flow of blood from a wound %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Ajasson is of opinion that this name was either Favra or Fona, Acca, %0a%3c Flora, or Yalesia or Yalentia. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' 35 “As in saying thus, The Devill take thee, or The Ravens peck out %0a%3c thine eyes, or I had rather see thee Pie peckt, and such like.”— Holland. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 It is a superstition still practised to pierce the shell of an egg after %0a%3c eating it, “ lest the witches should come.” Holland gives the following %0a%3c Note—“ Because afterwards no witches might pricke them with a needle %0a%3c in the name and behalfe of those whom they would hurt and mischeefe, %0a%3c according to the practice of pricking the images of any person in wax; %0a%3c used in the witchcraft of these daies.” We learn from Ajasson that till %0a%3c recently it was considered a mark of ill-breeding in France not to pierce %0a%3c the shell after eating the egg.

AVhy, too, upon the occasion of public %0a%3c lustrations, do we select persons with lucky names, to lead the %0a%3c Tictiras ? Why, to counteract fascinations, do we Romans %0a%3c observe a peculiar form of adoration, in invoking the Nemesis %0a%3c of the Greeks; whose statue, for this reason, has been placed %0a%3c in the Capitol at Rome, although the goddess herself possesses %0a%3c no Latin name? 44 Why, when we make mention of the dead, %0a%3c do we protest that we have no wish 45 to impeach their good %0a%3c name ? w Why is it that we entertain the belief that for every %0a%3c purpose odd numbers are the most effectual ; 47 —a thing that is %0a%3c particularly observed with reference to the critical days in %0a%3c fevers? Why is it that, when gathering the earliest fruit, %0a%3c apples, or pears, as the case may be, we make a point of saying %0a%3c —“This fruit is old, may other fruit be sent ns that is new ? ” %0a%3c Why is it that we salute 48 a person when he sneezes, an obser¬ %0a%3c vance which Tiberius Caesar, they say, the most unsociable of %0a%3c men, as we all know, used to exact, when riding in his chariot %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 De Enthusiasmo. 41 See B. xvii. c. 47. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 In passing along the Velabrum,on the occasion of his Gallic triumph, %0a%3c the axle of the carriage having broke. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 Sec Ovid’s Fasti, B. i. 1. 175, et scq., and Epist. de Ponto.

Some there are, too, who think it a point religiously %0a%3c to be observed to mention the name as well of the person whom %0a%3c they salute. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, besides, it is a notion 49 universally received, that %0a%3c absent persons have warning that others are speaking of them, %0a%3c by the tingling of the ears. Attalus 60 assures us, that if a %0a%3c person, the moment he sees a scorpion, says “ Duo,” 61 the rep- %0a%3c tile will stop short, and forbear to sting. And now that I am %0a%3c speaking of the scorpion, I recall to mind that in Africa no one %0a%3c ever undertakes any matter without prefacing with the word %0a%3c “ Africawhile in other countries, before an enterprise is %0a%3c commenced, it is the practice to adjure the gods that they %0a%3c will manifest their good will. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to this, it is very clear that there are some %0a%3c religious observances,' unaccompanied by speech, which are %0a%3c considered to be productive of certain effects. Thus, 62 when %0a%3c we are at table, for instance, it is the universal practice, we %0a%3c see, to take the ring from off the finger. Another person, %0a%3c again, will take some spittle from his mouth and place it with %0a%3c his finger behind the ear, to propitiate and modify disquietude %0a%3c of mind. When we wish to signify applause, we have a proverb %0a%3c even which tells us we should press the thumbs. 63 When pay¬ %0a%3c ing adoration, we kiss the right hand, and turn the whole %0a%3c body to the right: while the people of the Gallic provinces, on %0a%3c the contrary, turn to the left, and believe that they show %0a%3c mere devoutness by so doing. To salute summer lightning %0a%3c with clapping of the hands, is the universal practice with all %0a%3c nations. If, when eating, we happen to make mention of a %0a%3c fire that has happened, we avert the inauspicious omen by pour¬ %0a%3c ing water beneath the table. To sweep the floor at the moment %0a%3c that a person is rising from table, or to remove the table %0a%3c or tray, 64 as the case may be, while a guest is drinking, is %0a%3c looked upon as a most unfortunate presage. There is a treatise, %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 In France and England, at the present day, this notion, or rather, per¬ %0a%3c haps, the memory of it, is universally to be found.

Where a %0a%3c person has sneezed, it is considered highly ominous for the %0a%3c dish or table to be brought back again, and not a taste thereof %0a%3c to be taken, after doing so; the same, too, where a person at %0a%3c table eats nothing at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c These usages have been established by persons who enter¬ %0a%3c tained a belief that the gods are ever present, in all our affairs %0a%3c and at all hours, and who have therefore found the means of ap¬ %0a%3c peasing them by our vices even. It has been remarked, too, %0a%3c that there is never a dead silence on a sudden among the guests %0a%3c at table, except when there is an even number present; when %0a%3c this happens, too, it is a sign that the good name and repute of %0a%3c every individual present is in peril. In former times, when %0a%3c food fell from the hand of a guest, it was the custom to return %0a%3c it by placing it on the table, and it was forbidden 56 to blow %0a%3c upon it, for the purpose of cleansing it. Auguries, too, have been %0a%3c derived from the words or thoughts of a person at the moment %0a%3c such an accident befalls him ; and it is looked upon as one of %0a%3c the most dreadful of presages, if this should happen to a pontiff, %0a%3c while celebrating the feast of Dis. 67 The proper expiation in %0a%3c such a case is, to have the morsel replaced on table, and then %0a%3c burnt in honour of the Lar. 58 Medicines, it is said, will prove %0a%3c ineffectual, if they happen to have been placed on a table before %0a%3c they are administered.

To this class belong the Psylli, the Marsi, and the people %0a%3c 60 * Twenty-eighth , according to our reckoning. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 Probably from their ominous resemblance to the Parcae, or Fates, with %0a%3c their spindles, 02 “Frugum.” %0a%3c %0a%3c es “ Princeps civitatis.” 64 “ Rho ” and “Alpha.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 In B. vii. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 6.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES DEBITED FROM MAH. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 287 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c called “Ophiogenes ,” 66 in the Isle of Cyprus. One Euagon, %0a%3c a member of this family, while attending upon a deputation at %0a%3c Rome, was thrown by way of experiment, by order of the con¬ %0a%3c suls, into a large vessel 67 filled with serpents; upon which, %0a%3c to the astonishment of all, they licked his body all over with %0a%3c their tongues. One peculiarity of this family—if indeed it is %0a%3c still in existence—is the strong offensive smell which proceeds %0a%3c from their body in the spring ; their sweat, too, no less than %0a%3c their spittle, was possessed of remedial virtues. The people %0a%3c who are born at Tentyris, an island in the river Nilus, are %0a%3c so formidable 68 to the crocodiles there, that their voice even is %0a%3c sufficient to put them to flight. The presence even, it is well %0a%3c known, of all these different races, will suffice for the cure of %0a%3c injuries inflicted by the animals to which they respectively %0a%3c have an antipathy; just in the same way that wounds are %0a%3c irritated by the approach of persons who have been stung by %0a%3c a serpent at some former time, or bitten by a dog. Such %0a%3c persons, too, by their presence, will cause the eggs upon which %0a%3c a hen is sitting to be addled, and will make pregnant cattle %0a%3c cast their young and miscarry; for, in fact, so much of %0a%3c the venom remains in their body, that, from being poisoned %0a%3c themselves, they become poisonous to other creatures. The %0a%3c proper remedy in such case is first to make them wash their %0a%3c hands, and then to sprinkle with the water the patient who is %0a%3c under medical treatment. When, again, persons have been %0a%3c once stung by a scorpion they will never afterwards be attacked %0a%3c by hornets, wasps, or bees: a fact at which a person will be %0a%3c the less surprised when he learns that a garment which has %0a%3c been worn at a funeral will never be touched by moths ; 69 that %0a%3c it is hardly possible to draw serpents from their holes except %0a%3c by using the left hand; and that, of the discoveries made by %0a%3c Pythagoras, one of the most unerring, is the fact, that in the %0a%3c name given to infants, an odd number of vowels is portentous %0a%3c of lameness, loss of eyesight, or similar accidents, on 70 the right %0a%3c %0a%3c M In B. vii. c. 2, he speaks of these people—“ the serpent-born”—as %0a%3c natives of Parium, a town of the Hellespont.

In such a case, %0a%3c too, a successful result will be rendered all the more probable, %0a%3c if a light infantry lance 71 is used, which has been drawn from %0a%3c a man’s body without touching the earth; indeed, if it is %0a%3c brought into the house it will be productive of a similar result. %0a%3c In the same way, too, we find it stated in the writings of %0a%3c Orpheus and Archelaiis, that arrows, drawn from a human %0a%3c body without being allowed to touch the ground, and placed %0a%3c beneath the bed, will have all the effect of a philtre; and, %0a%3c what is even more than this, that it is a cure for epilepsy if %0a%3c the patient eats the flesh of a wild beast killed with an iron %0a%3c weapon with which a human being has been slain. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some individuals, too, are possessed of medicinal properties %0a%3c in certain parts of the body; the thumb of King Pyrrhus, for %0a%3c instance, as already 72 mentioned.

In our country, prize-fighters spit in the hand before %0a%3c beginning the combat, and costermongers spit on their morning’s handsel, %0a%3c or first earned money, for good luck. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 7.] PUOPKETIES OF THE HUMAN SPITTLE- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 289 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in a similar manner, too, we repel fascinations, and the evil %0a%3c presages attendant upon meeting a person who is lame in the %0a%3c right leg. We ask pardon of the gods, by spitting in 77 the %0a%3c lap, for entertaining some too presumptuous hope or expecta¬ %0a%3c tion. 76 On the same principle, it is the practice in all cases %0a%3c where medicine is employed, to spit three times on the ground, %0a%3c and to conjure the malady as often; the object being to aid the %0a%3c operation of the remedy employed. It is usual, too, to mark %0a%3c a boil, when it first makes its appearance, three times with %0a%3c fasting 79 spittle. What we are going to say is marvellous, %0a%3c but it may easily be tested 80 by experiment: if a person re¬ %0a%3c pents of a blow given to another, either by hand or with a %0a%3c missile, he has nothing to do but to spit at once into the palm %0a%3c of the hand which has inflicted the blow, and all feelings 81 of %0a%3c resentment will be instantly alleviated in the person struck. %0a%3c This, too, is often verified in the case of a beast of burden, %0a%3c when brought on its haunches with blows; for upon this remedy %0a%3c being adopted, the animal will immediately step out and mend %0a%3c its pace. Some persons, however, before making an effort, spit %0a%3c into the hand in manner above stated, in order to make the %0a%3c blow more heavy. 82 %0a%3c %0a%3c We may well believe, then, that lichens and leprous spots %0a%3c may be removed by a constant application of fasting spittle ; %0a%3c that ophthalmia may be cured by anointing, as it were, the %0a%3c eyes every morning with fasting spittle; that carcinomata %0a%3c may be effectually treated, by kneading the root of the plant %0a%3c known as “ apple of the earth,” 86 with human spittle; that %0a%3c crick in the neck may be got rid of by carrying fasting spittle %0a%3c to the right knee with the right hand, and to the left knee %0a%3c with the left; and that when an insect has got into the ear, it %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 “In sinum.” 18 See Juvenal, Sat. v. 1. 112. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Ajasson remarks that the human spittle contains hydrochlorate of %0a%3c soda and potash; the remedial virtues of which, however, would be in¬ %0a%3c finitely small. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 A quibble, Ajasson remarks. Did Pliny ever test it himself? He %0a%3c would seem to imply it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 “ Levatur illico in percusso culpa.’’ %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 This is still the case with pugilists, and persons requiring to use strong %0a%3c exertion. It is based, however, on a mere superstition, as Ajasson remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 “Malum teme.” See B. xxv. c. 54, and B. xxvi. c. 56. Littre %0a%3c translates “ malum,” “ apple,” in the former passage; hut here he calls it %0a%3c “curse of the earth.” %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

Opilius says that serpents %0a%3c will do the same, if a person spits into their open mouth; and %0a%3c Salpe tells us, that when any part of the body is asleep, the %0a%3c numbness may be got rid of by the person spitting into his %0a%3c lap, or touching the upper eyelid with his spittle. If we are %0a%3c ready to give faith to such statements as these, we must be¬ %0a%3c lieve also in the efficacy of the following practices: upon the %0a%3c entrance of a stranger, or when a person looks at an infant %0a%3c while asleep, it is usual for the nurse to spit three times upon %0a%3c the ground ; and this, although infants are under the especial %0a%3c guardianship of the god Fascinus, 65 the protector, not of infants %0a%3c only, but of generals as well, and a divinity whose worship is %0a%3c entrusted to the Yestal virgins, and forms part of the Koman %0a%3c rites. It is the image of this divinity that is attached beneath %0a%3c the triumphant car of the victorious general, protecting him, %0a%3c like some attendant physician, against the effects of envy; M %0a%3c while, at the same time, equally salutary is the advice of the %0a%3c tongue, which warns him to be wise in time, 87 that so Fortune %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 “Rubetas.” See B. viii. c. 48, B. xi. cc. 19, 76, and 116, and B. %0a%3c xxv. c. 76. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 This divinity was identical with Mutinus or Tutinus, and was %0a%3c worshipped under the form of a phallus, the male generative organ. As %0a%3c the guardian of infants, his peculiar form is still unconsciously represented %0a%3c in the shape of the coral bauble with which infants are aided in cutting %0a%3c their teeth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 Hence the expression “ prsefiscini,” “ Be it said without envy,” sup¬ %0a%3c posed to avert the effects of the envious eye, fascination, or enchantment. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 “ Resipiscere” seems to be a preferable reading to “respicere,” adopted %0a%3c by Sillig. This passage is evidently in a very corrupt state; but it is most %0a%3c probable that reference is made to the attendant who stood behind the %0a%3c general in his triumph, and reminded him that he was a man—or, according %0a%3c to Tzetzes, bade him look behind him. Pliny speaks of a servant attending %0a%3c the triumphant general, with a golden crown, in B. xxxiii. c. 4. Ilardouiu %0a%3c attempts another explanation, but a very contused and improbable one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 9.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM THE HUMAN HAIR. 2 { J 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c may be prevailed upon by his prayers, not to follow, as the %0a%3c destroyer of his glory, close upon his back. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE WAX OF THE HUMAN %0a%3c %0a%3c EAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The human bite is also looked upon as one of the most dan¬ %0a%3c gerous of all. The proper remedy for it is human ear-wax ; %0a%3c a thing that we must not be surprised at, seeing that, if ap¬ %0a%3c plied immediately, it is a cure for the stings of scorpions even, %0a%3c and serpents. The best, however, for this purpose, is that %0a%3c taken from the ears of the wounded person. Agnails, too, %0a%3c it is said, may be cured in a similar manner.

A man’s hair, applied with vinegar, is a cure for the %0a%3c bite of a dog, and, used with oil or wine, for wounds on the %0a%3c head. It is said, too, if we choose to believe it, that the hair %0a%3c of a man torn down from the cross, is good for quartan fevers. %0a%3c Ashes, too, of burnt human hair are curative of carcinomata. %0a%3c If a woman takes the first tooth that a child has shed, provided %0a%3c it has not touched the ground, and has it set in a bracelet, and %0a%3c wears it constantly upon her arm, it will preserve her from %0a%3c all pains in the uterus and adjacent parts. If the great toe %0a%3c is tied fast to the one next to it, it will reduce tumours in the %0a%3c groin; and if the two middle fingers of the right hand are %0a%3c slightly bound together with a linen thread, it will act as a %0a%3c preservative against catarrhs and ophthalmia. A stone, it is %0a%3c said, that has been voided by a patient suffering from calculi, %0a%3c if attached to the body above the pubes, will alleviate the %0a%3c pains of others similarly afflicted, as well as pains in the liver ; %0a%3c it will have the effect, also, of facilitating delivery. Granius 68 %0a%3c adds, however, that for thi3 last purpose, the stone will be more %0a%3c efficacious if it has been extracted with the knife.

Some say that, for %0a%3c epilepsy, the great toes should be pricked, and the drops of %0a%3c blood that^gxude therefrom applied to the face; or else, that a %0a%3c virgin should touch the patient with her right thumb—a cir¬ %0a%3c cumstance that has led to the belief that persons suffering from %0a%3c epilepsy should eat the flesh of animals in a virgin state. %0a%3c Jjlschines of Athens used to cure quinzy, carcinoma, and affec¬ %0a%3c tions of the tonsillary glands and uvula, with the ashes of %0a%3c burnt excrements, a medicament to which he gave the name %0a%3c of “ botryon.” 89 %0a%3c %0a%3c There are many kinds of diseases which disappear entirely %0a%3c after the first sexual congress, 90 or, in the case of females, at the %0a%3c first appearance of menstruation; indeed, if such is not the %0a%3c ease, they are apt to become chronic, epilepsy in particular. %0a%3c Even more than this—a man, it is said, who has been stung %0a%3c by a serpent or scorpion, experiences relief from the sexual %0a%3c congress; but the woman, on the other hand, is sensible of %0a%3c detriment. We are assured, too, that if persons, when washing %0a%3c their feet, touch the eyes three times with the water, they will %0a%3c never be subject to ophthalmia or other diseases of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE DEAD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scrofula, imposthumes of the parotid glands, and throat %0a%3c diseases, they say, may be cured by the contact of the hand of %0a%3c a person who has been carried off by an early death : jndeed %0a%3c there are some who assert that any dead body will produce the %0a%3c same effect, provided it is of the same sex as the patient, and %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 Properly meaning “a cluster of grapes.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 Ajasson remarks that there is a considerable degree of truth in this %0a%3c assertion.

Some persons recommend the tooth to be fumigated %0a%3c •with the smoke of a burnt tooth, which l5as belonged to another %0a%3c person of the same sex; or else to attach to the person a dog¬ %0a%3c tooth, as it is called, which has been extracted from a body %0a%3c before burial. Earth, they say, taken from out of a human %0a%3c skull, acts as a depilatory to the eyelashes; it is asserted, also, %0a%3c that any plant which may happen to have grown there, if %0a%3c chewed, will cause the teeth to come out; and that if a circle %0a%3c is traced round an ulcer with a human bone, it will be effec¬ %0a%3c tually prevented from spreading. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons, again, mix water in equal proportions from %0a%3c three different wells, and, after making a libation with part of %0a%3c it in a new earthen vessel, administer the rest to patients suf¬ %0a%3c fering from tertian fever, when the paroxysms come on. So, %0a%3c too, in cases of quartan fever, they take a fragment of a nail %0a%3c from a cross, or else a piece of a halter 93 that has been used %0a%3c for crucifixion, and, after wrapping it in wool, attach it to the %0a%3c patient’s neck; taking care, the moment he has recovered, to %0a%3c conceal it in some hole to which the light of the sun cannot %0a%3c penetrate. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12.-VARIOUS REVERIES AND DEVICES OF THE MAGICIANS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following are some of the reveries of magic. 93 A whet¬ %0a%3c stone upon which iron tools have been frequently sharpened, %0a%3c if put, without his being aware of it, beneath the pillow of a %0a%3c person sinking under the effects of poison, will make him give %0a%3c evidence and declare what poison has been administered, and %0a%3c at what time and place, though at the same time he will not %0a%3c disclose the author of the crime. When a person has been %0a%3c 6truck by lightning, if the body is turned upon the side which %0a%3c has sustained the injury, he will instantly recover the power %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 This superstition still exists among the lower classes of this country, %0a%3c with reference to the beneficial effects of stroking neck diseases with the %0a%3c hand of a man who has been hanged. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Made of “ spartum.” See B. xix. cc. 6, 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 Of which the Persian Magi were the most noted professors. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 294 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of speech—that is quite certain. M For the cure of inguinal %0a%3c tumours, some persons take the thrum of an old web, and alter %0a%3c tying seven or nine knots in it, mentioning at each knot the %0a%3c name of some widow woman or other, attach it to the part %0a%3c affected. To assuage the pain of a wound, they recommend %0a%3c the party to take a nail or any other substance that has been %0a%3c trodden under foot, and to wear it, attached to the body with %0a%3c the thrum of a web. To get rid of w r arts, some lie in a %0a%3c footpath with the face upwards, when the moon is twenty days %0a%3c old at least, and after fixing their gaze upon it, extend their %0a%3c arms above the head, and rub themselves with anything %0a%3c within their reach. If a person is extracting a corn at the %0a%3c moment that a star shoots, he will experience an immediate %0a%3c cure, 95 they say. By pouring vinegar upon the hinges of a %0a%3c door, a thick liniment is formed, which, applied to the fore¬ %0a%3c head, will alleviate headache : an effect equally produced, we %0a%3c are told, by binding the temples with a halter with which a %0a%3c man has been hanged. When a fish-bone happens to stick in %0a%3c the throat, it will go down immediately, if the person plunges %0a%3c his feet into cold water; but where the accident has happened %0a%3c with any other kind of bone, the proper remedy is to apply %0a%3c to the head some fragments of bones taken from the same dish. %0a%3c In cases where bread has stuck in the throat, the best plan is %0a%3c to take some of the same bread, and insert it in both ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 13.- REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN EXCRETIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Greece, where everything is turned to account, the %0a%3c owners of the gymnasia have introduced the very excretions 5 * %0a%3c even of the human body among the most efficient remedies; %0a%3c so much so, indeed, that the scrapings from the bodies of the %0a%3c athletes are looked upon as possessed of certain properties of %0a%3c an emollient, calorific, resolvent, and expletive nature, re¬ %0a%3c sulting from the compound of human sweat and oil. These %0a%3c scrapings are used, in the form of a pessary, for inflammations %0a%3c and contractions of the uterus : similarly employed, they act %0a%3c as an emmenagogue, and are useful for reducing condylomata %0a%3c and inflammations of the rectum, as also for assuaging pains %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 The “constat” here, whether it belongs to the magicians, or to Pliny %0a%3c himself, is highly amusing, as Ajasson remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 Sillig Appears to be right in his conjecture that the “vel” here %0a%3c should be omitted. 96 See B. xv. c. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 14 ] BEMEDIE8 DEPENDING UPON THE WILD. 295 %0a%3c %0a%3c in the sinews, sprains, and nodosities of the joints. The %0a%3c scrapings obtained from the baths are still more efficacious for %0a%3c these purposes, and hence it is that they form an ingredient in %0a%3c maturative preparations. Such scrapings as are impregnated %0a%3c with wrestlers’ oil, 97 used in combination with mud, have a %0a%3c mollifying effect upon the joints, and are more particularly %0a%3c efficacious as a calorific and resolvent; but in other respects %0a%3c their properties are not so strongly developed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shameless and disgusting researches that have been %0a%3c made will quite transcend all belief, when we find authors of %0a%3c the very highest repute proclaiming aloud that the male %0a%3c seminal fluid is a sovereign remedy for the sting of the scor¬ %0a%3c pion ! In the case too, of women afflicted with sterility, they %0a%3c recommend the application of a pessary, made of the first %0a%3c excrement that is voided by an infant at the moment of its %0a%3c birth; the name they give it is “meconium.” 99 They have %0a%3c even gone so far, too, as to 6crape the very filth from off the %0a%3c walls of the gymnasia, and to assert that this is also possessed %0a%3c of certain calorific properties. These scrapings are used as a %0a%3c resolvent for inflamed tumours, and are applied topically to %0a%3c ulcers upon aged people and children, and to excoriations and %0a%3c bums. %0a%3c %0a%3c CEAP. 14.-EEMEDIES DEPENDING UPON THE HUMAN WILL. %0a%3c %0a%3c It would be the less becoming then for me to omit all %0a%3c mention of the remedies which depend upon the human will. %0a%3c Total abstinence from food or drink, or from wine only, from %0a%3c flesh, or from the use of the bath, in cases where the health %0a%3c requires any of these expedients, is looked upon as one of the %0a%3c most effectual modes of treating diseases. To this class of %0a%3c remedies must be added bodily exercise, exertion of the voice, 99 %0a%3c anointings, and frictions according to a prescribed method: %0a%3c for powerful friction, it should be remembered, has a binding %0a%3c effect upon the body, while gentle friction, on the other hand, %0a%3c acts as a laxative; so too, repeated friction reduces the %0a%3c body, while used in moderation it has a tendency to make %0a%3c llesh. But the most beneficial practice of all is to take walking %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 “ Ceroma.” A mixture of oil and wax. %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 Properly, “ poppy juice.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 Or “ clara lectio,” “reading aloud,” as Celsus calls it, recommending %0a%3c it for persons of slow digestion. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 296 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c punt’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c or carriage 1 exercise; this last being performed in various ways. %0a%3c Exercise on horseback is extremely good for affections of the %0a%3c stomach and hips, a voyage for phthisis, 2 and a change of %0a%3c locality 3 for diseases of long standing. So, too, a cure may %0a%3c sometimes be effected by sleep, by a recumbent position in bed, %0a%3c or by the use of emetics in moderation. To lie upon the back %0a%3c is beneficial to the sight, to lie with the face downwards is %0a%3c good for a cough, and to lie on the side is recommended for %0a%3c patients suffering from catarrh. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to Aristotle and Eabianus, it is towards spring and %0a%3c autumn that we are most apt to dream; and they tell us that %0a%3c persons are most liable to do so when lying on the back, but %0a%3c never when lying with the face downwards. Theophrastus %0a%3c assures us that the digestion is accelerated by lying on the %0a%3c right side; while, on the other hand, it is retarded by lying %0a%3c with the face upwards. The most powerful, however, of all %0a%3c remedies, and one which is always at a person’s own command, %0a%3c is the sun: violent friction, too, is useful by the agency of %0a%3c linen towels and body-scrapers. 4 To pour warm water on the %0a%3c head before taking the vapour-bath, and cold water after it, is %0a%3c looked upon as a most beneficial practice; so, too, is the habit %0a%3c of taking cold water before food, of drinking it every now and %0a%3c then while eating, of taking it just before going to sleep, and, %0a%3c if practicable, of waking every now and then, and taking a %0a%3c draught. It is worthy also of remark, that there is no living %0a%3c creature but man 5 that is fond of hot drinks, a proof that they %0a%3c are contrary to nature. It has been ascertained by experiment, %0a%3c that it is a good plan to rinse the mouth with undiluted wine, %0a%3c before going to sleep, for the purpose of sweetening the breath; %0a%3c to rinse the mouth with cold water an odd number of times %0a%3c every morning, as a preservative against tooth-ache; and to %0a%3c wash the eyes with oxycrate, as a preventive of ophthalmia. %0a%3c It has been remarked also, that the general health is improved %0a%3c by a varying regimen, subject to no fixed rules. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 “Gestatio.” Exercise on horseback, in a carriage drawn by horses, %0a%3c or in a litter. See B. xxvi. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 See B. xxxi. c. 33.

(6.)-REMEDIES DEEIVED FBOM SNEEZING. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sneezing, provoked by a feather, relieves heaviness in the %0a%3c head; it is said too, that to touch the nostrils of a mule with %0a%3c the lips, will arrest sneezing and hiccup. For this last pur¬ %0a%3c pose, Yarro recommends us to scratch the palm, first of one %0a%3c hand and then of the other; while many say that it is a good %0a%3c plan to shift the ring from off the left hand to the longest finger %0a%3c of the right, and then to plunge the hands into hot water. %0a%3c Theophrastus says, that aged persons sneeze with greater diffi¬ %0a%3c culty than others. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 16.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SEXUAL CONGRESS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Democritus spoke in condemnation of the sexual congress, as® %0a%3c being merelyanact through which one human being springs from %0a%3c another; and really, by Hercules ! the more rarely it is used %0a%3c the better. Still however, athletes, we find, when they become %0a%3c dull and heavy, are re-established by it: the voice, too, is re¬ %0a%3c stored by it, when from being perfectly clear, it has degenerated %0a%3c into hoarseness. The congress of the sexes is a cure also for %0a%3c pains in the loins, dimness of the eyesight, 9 alienation of the %0a%3c mental difficulties, and melancholy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 “ Non prandentium.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Callisthenes the physician is the person supposed to be alluded to. %0a%3c Lucullus did not seem to be of opinion that a man “ must be a fool or a %0a%3c physician at forty.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 “Ut in qua homo alius exsiliret ex homine.” _ The true meaning of %0a%3c this it seems impossible, with certainty, to ascertain: though a more in¬ %0a%3c delicate one than that given might be easily suggested. %0a%3c %0a%3c * On the contrary, some authorities say that it is apt to cause dimness of %0a%3c right. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 293 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17.-VARIOUS OTHER REMEDIES. %0a%3c %0a%3c To sit by a pregnant woman, or by a person to whom any %0a%3c remedy is being administered, with the fingers of one hand %0a%3c inserted between those of the other, acts as a magic spell; a %0a%3c discovery that was made, it is said, when Alcmena 10 was %0a%3c delivered of Hercules. If the fingers are thus joined, clasping %0a%3c one or both knees, or if the ham of one leg is first put upon %0a%3c the knee of the other, and then changed about, the omen is of %0a%3c still worse signification. Hence it is, that in councils held by %0a%3c generals and persons in authority, our ancestors forbade these %0a%3c postures, as being an impediment to all business. 11 They have %0a%3c given a similar prohibition also with reference to sacrifices and %0a%3c the offering of public vows ; but as to the usage of uncovering %0a%3c the head in presence of the magistrates, that has been enjoined, %0a%3c Yarro says, not as a mark of respect, but with a view to %0a%3c health, the head being strengthened 12 by the practice of keeping %0a%3c it uncovered. %0a%3c %0a%3c When anything has got into the eye, it is a good plan to %0a%3c close the other; and when water has got into the right ear, %0a%3c the person should hop about on the left foot, with the head %0a%3c reclining upon the right shoulder, the reverse being done %0a%3c when the same has happened to the left ear. If the secretion %0a%3c of the phlegm produces coughing, the best way of stopping it %0a%3c is for another person to blow in the party’s face. When the %0a%3c uvula is relaxed, another person should take the patient with %0a%3c his teeth by the crown, 13 and lift him from the ground ; while %0a%3c for pains in the neck, the hams should be rubbed, and for %0a%3c pains in the hams the neck. If a person is seized in bed with %0a%3c cramp in the sinews of the legs or thighs, he should set his %0a%3c feet upon the ground: so, too, if he has cramp on the left %0a%3c side, he should take hold of the great toe of the left foot with %0a%3c the right hand, and if on the right side, the great toe of the %0a%3c right foot with the left hand. For cold shiverings or for %0a%3c excessive bleeding at the nostrils, the extremities of the body %0a%3c should be well rubbed with sheep’s wool. To arrest inconti¬ %0a%3c nence of urine, the extremities of the generative organs should %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 See Ovid, Met. ix. 273, et seq. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Much more probably, because they were considered to be significant %0a%3c of anything but seriousness and attention. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Exemplified in the case of the Egyptians, Herodotus says. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 The remedy would seem to be worse than the evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 18.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM TIIE TJRINE. 299 %0a%3c %0a%3c be tied with a thread of linen or papyrus, and a binding passed %0a%3c round the middle of the thigh. For derangement of the %0a%3c stomach, it is a good plan to press the feet together, or to %0a%3c plunge the hands into hot water. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to all this, in many cases it is found highly be¬ %0a%3c neficial to speak but little; thus, for instance, Mtecenas Me- %0a%3c lissus, 11 we are told, enjoined silence on himself for three %0a%3c years, in consequence of spitting blood after a convulsive fit. %0a%3c When a person is thrown from a carriage, or when, while %0a%3c mounting an elevation or lying extended at full length, he %0a%3c is menaced with any accident, or if he receives a blow, it is %0a%3c singularly beneficial to hold the breath ; a discovery for which %0a%3c we are indebted to an animal, as already 15 stated. %0a%3c %0a%3c To thrust an iron nail into the spot where a person’s head %0a%3c la}' at the moment he was seized with a fit of epilepsy, is said %0a%3c to have the effect of curing him of that disease. For pains in %0a%3c the kidneys, loins, or bladder, it is considered highly soothing %0a%3c to void the urine lying on the face at full length in a reclining %0a%3c bath. It is quite surprising how much more speedily wounds %0a%3c will heal if they are bound up and tied with a Hercules’ knot : 16 %0a%3c indeed, it is said, that if the girdle which we wear every day %0a%3c is tied with a knot of this description, it will be productive of %0a%3c certain beneficial effects, Hercules having been the first to %0a%3c discover the fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c Demetrius, in the treatise which he has compiled upon the %0a%3c number Four, alleges certain reasons why drink should never %0a%3c be taken in proportions of four cyathi or sextarii. As a pre¬ %0a%3c ventive of ophthalmia, it is a good plan to rub the parts be¬ %0a%3c hind the ears, and, as a cure for watery eyes, to rub the fore¬ %0a%3c head. As to the presages which are derived from man him¬ %0a%3c self, there is one to the effect that so long as a person is able %0a%3c to see himself reflected in the pupil of the patient’s eye, %0a%3c there need be no apprehension of a fatal termination to the %0a%3c malady. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE URINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The urine, 17 too, has been the subject not only of numerous %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 See end of B. vii. 15 In B. viii. c. 58. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 A knot tied very hard, and in which no ends were to be seen. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 This excretion was, till lately, thought of great importance, as in¬ %0a%3c dicative of the health of the patient. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 300 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. [Book XXVIII %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c theories with authors, but of various religious observances as %0a%3c well, its properties being classified under several distinctive %0a%3c heads: thus, for instance, the urine of eunuchs, they say, is %0a%3c highly beneficial as a promoter of fruitfulness in females. But %0a%3c to turn to those remedies which we may he allowed to name %0a%3c without impropriety—the urine of children who have not %0a%3c arrived at puberty is a sovereign remedy for the poisonous %0a%3c secretions of the asp known as the “ ptyas,” 18 from the fact %0a%3c that it spits its venom into the eyes of human beings. It is %0a%3c good, too, for the cure of albugo, films and marks upon the %0a%3c eyes, white specks 19 upon the pupils, and maladies of the eye¬ %0a%3c lids. In combination with meal of fitches, it is used for the %0a%3c cure of burns, and, with a head of bulbed leek, it is boiled %0a%3c down to one half, in a new earthen vessel, for the treatment of %0a%3c suppurations of the ears, or the extermination of worms breed¬ %0a%3c ing in those organs : the vapour, too, of this decoction acts as %0a%3c an emmenagogue. Salpe recommends that the eyes should %0a%3c be fomented with it, as a means of strengthening the sight; %0a%3c and that it should be used as a liniment for sun scorches, %0a%3c in combination with white of egg, that of the ostrich being %0a%3c the most effectual, the application being kept on for a couple %0a%3c of hours. %0a%3c %0a%3c Urine is also used for taking out ink spots. Male urine %0a%3c cures gout, witness the fullers for instance, 20 who, for this %0a%3c reason, it is said, are never troubled with that disease. With %0a%3c stale urine some mix ashes of calcined oyster-shells, for the %0a%3c cure of eruptions on the bodies of infants, and all kinds of %0a%3c running ulcers: it is used, too, as a liniment for corrosive sores, %0a%3c burns, diseases of the rectum, chaps upon the body, and stings %0a%3c inflicted by scorpions. The most celebrated midwives have %0a%3c pronounced that there is no lotion which removes itching sen¬ %0a%3c sations more effectually; and, with the addition of nitre, 21 they %0a%3c prescribe it for the cure of ulcers of the head, porrigo, and %0a%3c cancerous sores, those of the generative organs in particular. %0a%3c But the fact is, and there is no impropriety in saying so, that %0a%3c every person’s own urine is the best for his own case, due %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 From the Greek irrvut, “ to spit.” %0a%3c %0a%3c is « Argema.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Who had to use lant, or stale urine, in their business. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 At a future period we shall have to discuss the identity of the %0a%3c “nitrum ” of Pliny.

Kneaded %0a%3c up with ashes, it is good for the bite of a mad dog, and for the %0a%3c cure of stings inflicted by serpents. As to the bite of the %0a%3c scolopendra, the effects of urine are said to be quite mar¬ %0a%3c vellous—the person who has been injured has only to touch %0a%3c the crown of his head with a drop of his own urine, and he %0a%3c will experience an instantaneous cure. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19.—INDICATIONS OF HEALTH DERIVED FROM THE URINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Certain indications of the health are furnished by the urine. %0a%3c Thus, for example, if it is white at first in the morning and %0a%3c afterwards high-coloured, the first signifies that the digestion is %0a%3c going on, the last that it is completed. When the urine is red, %0a%3c it is a bad sign; but when it is swarthy, it is the worst sign %0a%3c of all. So, too, when it is thick or full of bubbles, it is a bad %0a%3c sign; and when a white sediment forms, it is a symptom of %0a%3c pains in the region of the viscera or in the joints. A green- %0a%3c coloured urine is indicative of disease of the viscera, a pale urine %0a%3c of biliousness, and a red urine of some distemper in the blood. %0a%3c The urine is in a bad state, too, when certain objects form in %0a%3c it, like bran or fine clouds in appearance. A thin, white, urine %0a%3c also is in a diseased state ; but when it is thick and possessed %0a%3c of an offensive smell, it is significant of approaching death : so, %0a%3c too, when with children it is thin and watery. %0a%3c %0a%3c The adepts in magic expressly forbid a person, when about %0a%3c to make water, to uncover the body in the face of the sun 22 or %0a%3c moon, or to sprinkle with his urine the shadow of any object %0a%3c whatsoever. Hesiod 23 gives a precept, recommending persons to %0a%3c make water against an object standing full before them, that no %0a%3c divinity may be offended by their nakedness being uncovered. %0a%3c Osthanes maintains that every one who drops some urine %0a%3c upon his foot in the morning will be proof against all noxious %0a%3c medicaments. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20.

The smell of a %0a%3c woman’s hair, burnt, will drive away serpents, and hysterical %0a%3c suffocations, it is said, may be dispelled thereby. The ashes %0a%3c of a woman’s hair, burnt in an earthen vessel, or used in %0a%3c combination with litharge, will cure eruptions and prurigo of %0a%3c the eyes: used in combination with honey they will remove %0a%3c warts and ulcers upon infants ; with the addition of honey and %0a%3c frankincense, they will heal wounds upon the head, and fill up %0a%3c all concavities left by corrosive ulcers; used with hogs’ lard, %0a%3c they will cure inflammatory tumours and gout; and applied topi¬ %0a%3c cally to the part affected, they will arrest erysipelas and hae¬ %0a%3c morrhage, and remove itching pimples on the body which %0a%3c resemble the stings of ants. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 21. —REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOMAN’S MILK. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the uses to which woman’s milk has been applied, it %0a%3c is generally agreed that it is the sweetest and the most deli¬ %0a%3c cate of all, and that it is the best 25 of remedies for chronic %0a%3c fevers and coeliac affections, when the woman has just weaned %0a%3c her infant more particularly. In cases, too, of sickness at %0a%3c stomach, fevers, and gnawing sensations, it has been found by %0a%3c experience to be highly beneficial; as also, in combination %0a%3c with frankincense, for abscesses of the mamill®. When the %0a%3c eyes are bloodshot from the effects of a blow, or affected with %0a%3c pain or defluxion, it is a very good plan to inject woman’s milk %0a%3c into them, more particularly in combination with honey and %0a%3c juice of daffodil, or else powdered frankincense. In all cases, %0a%3c however, the milk of a woman who has been delivered of a %0a%3c male child is the most efficacious, and still more so if she has %0a%3c had male twins; provided always she abstains from wine and %0a%3c food of an acrid nature. Mixed with the white of an egg in %0a%3c a liquid state, and applied to the forehead in wool, it arrests %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 The use o.f the word “ prodidere ” shows that treatises had been %0a%3c written on these abominable subjects. Lai's, Elephantis, and Salpe were %0a%3c probably the “ meretrices ” to whom he here alludes. See c. 23, and the %0a%3c end of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 There is probably no foundation for this assertion. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 21.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOMAN'S MILK. 303 %0a%3c %0a%3c defluxions of the eyes. If a frog 26 has spirted its secretions 27 %0a%3c into the eye, woman’s milk is a most excellent remedy ; and %0a%3c for the bite of that reptile it is used both internally and ex¬ %0a%3c ternally. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is asserted that if a person is rubbed at the same moment %0a%3c with the milk of both mother and daughter, he will be proof %0a%3c for the rest of his life against all affections of the eyes. %0a%3c Mixed with a small quantity of oil, woman’s milk is a cure for %0a%3c diseases of the ears; and if they are in pain from the effects %0a%3c of a blow, it is applied warm with goose-grease. If the ears %0a%3c emit an offensive smell, a thing that is mostly the case in %0a%3c diseases of long standing, wool is introduced into those organs, %0a%3c steeped in woman’s milk and honey. While symptoms of %0a%3c jaundice are still visible in the eyes, woman’s milk is injected, %0a%3c in combination with elaterium. 28 Taken as a drink, it is pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of singularly good effects, where the poison of the %0a%3c sea-hare, the buprestis, 29 or, as Aristotle tells us, the plant %0a%3c dorycniunr 10 has been administered ; as a preventive also of the %0a%3c madness produced by taking henbane. Woman’s milk also, %0a%3c mixed with hemlock, is recommended as a liniment for gout; %0a%3c while some there are who employ it for that purpose in com¬ %0a%3c bination with wool-grease 31 or goose-grease ; a form in which %0a%3c it is used as an application for pains in the uterus. Taken as %0a%3c a drink, it arrests diarrhoea, llabirius 32 says, and acts as an %0a%3c emmenagogue; but where the woman has been delivered of a %0a%3c female child, her milk is of use only for the cure of face %0a%3c diseases. %0a%3c %0a%3c Woman’s milk is also a cure for affections of the lungs ; and, %0a%3c mixed with the urine of a youth who has not arrived at pu¬ %0a%3c berty, and Attic honey, in the proportion of one spoonful %0a%3c of each, it removes singing in the ears, I find. Dogs which %0a%3c have once tasted the milk of a woman who has been delivered %0a%3c of a male child, will never become mad, they say. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 “Rana.” He means the “ rubeta” probably, or “bramble-frog,” %0a%3c so often mentioned by him.

For, in the first %0a%3c place, hailstorms, they say, whirlwinds, and lightning 31 even, %0a%3c will be scared away by a woman uncovering her body while %0a%3c her monthly courses are upon her. The same, too, with all %0a%3c other kinds of tempestuous weather; and out at sea, a storm %0a%3c may be lulled by a woman uncovering her body merely, even %0a%3c though not menstruating at the time. As to the menstrual %0a%3c discharge itself, a thing that in other respects, as 35 already %0a%3c stated on a more appropriate occasion, is productive of the most %0a%3c monstrous effects, there are some ravings about it of a most %0a%3c dreadful and unutterable nature. Of these particulars, how¬ %0a%3c ever, I do not feel so much shocked at mentioning the follow¬ %0a%3c ing. If the menstrual discharge coincides with an eclipse of %0a%3c the moon or sun, the evils resulting from it are irremediable; %0a%3c and no less so, when it happens while the moon is in conjunc¬ %0a%3c tion with the sun ; the congress with a woman at such a period %0a%3c being noxious, and attended with fatal effects to the man. At %0a%3c this period also, the lustre of purple is tarnished by the touch %0a%3c of a woman : so much more baneful is her influence at this %0a%3c time than at any other. At any other time, also, if a woman %0a%3c strips herself naked while she is menstruating, and walks %0a%3c round a field of wheat, the caterpillars, worms, beetles, and %0a%3c other vermin, will fall from off the ears of corn. Metrodorus %0a%3c of Scepsos tells us that this discovery was first made in Cappa¬ %0a%3c docia ; and that, in consequence of such multitudes of can- %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 “ Fascia.” Either a stomacher, or a fillet for the head. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 The mention of lightning here, Hardouin seems to look upon as an %0a%3c interpolation. 35 In B. vii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE MENSTRUAL DISCHARGE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 305 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 23.] %0a%3c %0a%3c tharides being found to breed there, it is the practice for %0a%3c women to walk through the middle of the fields with their %0a%3c garments tucked up above the thighs. 36 In other places, again, %0a%3c it is the usage for women to go barefoot, with the hair %0a%3c dishevelled and the girdle loose : due precaution must be taken, %0a%3c however, that this is not done at sun-rise, for if so, the crop %0a%3c will wither and dry up. Young vines, too, it is said, are in¬ %0a%3c jured irremediably by the touch of a woman in this state ; and %0a%3c both rue and ivy, plants possessed of highly medicinal virtues, %0a%3c will die instantly upon being touched by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Much as I have already stated on the. virulent effects of this %0a%3c discharge, I have to state, in addition, that bees, it is a well- %0a%3c known fact, will forsake their hives if touched by a menstruous %0a%3c woman; that linen boiling in the cauldron will turn black, that %0a%3c the edge of a razor will become blunted, and that copper ves¬ %0a%3c sels will contract a fetid smell and become covered with verdi- %0a%3c grease, on coming in contact with her. A mare big with foal, %0a%3c it' touched by a woman in this state, will be sure to miscarry; %0a%3c nay, even more than this, at the very sight of a woman, %0a%3c though seen at a distance even, should she happen to be %0a%3c menstruating for the first time after the loss of her virginity, %0a%3c or for the first time, while in a state of virginity. The bitu¬ %0a%3c men 37 that is found in Judaea, will yield to nothing but the %0a%3c menstrual discharge ; its tenacity being overcome, as already %0a%3c stated, by the agency of a tliread from a garment which has %0a%3c been brought in contact with this fluid. Tire itself even, an %0a%3c element which triumphs over every other substance, is unable %0a%3c to conquer this; for if reduced to ashes and then sprinkled %0a%3c upon garments when about to be scoured, it will change their %0a%3c purple tint, and tarnish the brightness of the colours. Indeed %0a%3c so pernicious are its properties, that women themselves, the %0a%3c source from which it is derived, are far from being proof against %0a%3c its effects; a pregnant woman, for instance, if touched with %0a%3c it, or indeed if she so much as steps over it, will be liable to %0a%3c miscarry. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lais and Elepliantis 38 have given statements quite at va¬ %0a%3c riance, on the subject of abortives ; they mention the efficacy %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Columella describes this practice in verse, in B. x., and in B. xi. c. 3* %0a%3c JSlian also mentions it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 See B. vii. c. 13.

Bithus of Dyrrha- %0a%3c chium informs us that a mirror, 39 which has been tarnished by %0a%3c the gaze of a menstruous female, will recover its brightness if %0a%3c the same woman looks steadily upon the back of it; he states, %0a%3c also, that all evil influences of this nature will be entirely %0a%3c neutralized, if the woman carries the fish known as the sur %0a%3c mullet about her person. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, again, many writers say that, baneful as %0a%3c it is, there are certain remedial properties in this fluid; that it %0a%3c is a good plan, for instance, to use it as a topical application for %0a%3c gout, and that women, while menstruating, can give relief by %0a%3c touching scrofulous sores and imposthumes of the parotid %0a%3c glands, inflamed tumours, erysipelas, boils, and defluxions of %0a%3c the eyes. According to La'is and Salpe, the bite of a mad dog, %0a%3c as well as tertian or quartan fevers, may be cured by putting %0a%3c some menstruous blood in the wool of a black ram and enclo¬ %0a%3c sing it in a silver bracelet; and we learn from Diotirnus of %0a%3c Thebes that the smallest portion will suffice of any kind of %0a%3c cloth that has been stained therewith, a thread even, if in¬ %0a%3c serted and worn in a bracelet. The midwife Sotira informs %0a%3c us that the most efficient cure for tertian and quartan fevers is %0a%3c to rub the soles of the patient’s feet therewith, the result being %0a%3c ,still more successful if the operation is performed by the woman %0a%3c herself, without the patient being aware of it; she says, too, %0a%3c that this is an excellent method for reviving persons when %0a%3c attacked with epilepsy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Icetidas the physician pledges his word that quartan fever %0a%3c may be cured by sexual intercourse, provided the woman is %0a%3c just beginning to menstruate. It is universally agreed, too, that %0a%3c when a person has been bitten by a dog and manifests a dread %0a%3c of water and of all kinds of drink, it will be quite sufficient %0a%3c to put under his cup a strip of cloth that has been dipped in %0a%3c - 39 See B. vii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 24.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE ELEPHANT. 30/ %0a%3c %0a%3c this fluid; the result being that the hydrophobia will immedi¬ %0a%3c ately disappear. This arises, no doubt, from that powerful %0a%3c sympathy which has been so much spoken of by the Greeks, %0a%3c and the existence of which is proved by the fact, 40 already men¬ %0a%3c tioned, that dogs become mad upon tasting this fluid. It is a well- %0a%3c known fact, too, that the menstruous discharge, reduced to ashes, %0a%3c and applied with furnace soot and wax, is a cure for ulcers upon %0a%3c all kinds of beasts of burden; and that stains made upon a gar¬ %0a%3c ment with it can only be removed by the agency of the urine %0a%3c of the same female. Equally certain it is, too, that this fluid, re¬ %0a%3c duced to ashes and mixed with oil of roses, is very useful, applied %0a%3c to the forehead, for allaying head-ache, in women more parti¬ %0a%3c cularly , as also that the nature of the discharge is most viru¬ %0a%3c lent in females whose virginity has been destroyed solely by %0a%3c the lapse of time. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another thing universally acknowledged and one which I %0a%3c am ready to believe with the greatest pleasure, is the fact, that %0a%3c if the door-posts are only touched with the menstruous fluid %0a%3c all spells of the magicians will be neutralized—a set of men %0a%3c the most lying in existence, as any one may ascertain. I will %0a%3c give an example of one of the most reasonable of their pre¬ %0a%3c scriptions lake the parings of the toe-nails and finger-nails %0a%3c of a sick person, and mix them up with wax, the party saying %0a%3c that he is seeking a remedy for a tertian, quartan, or quotidian %0a%3c fever, as the case may be; then stick this wax, before sunrise, %0a%3c upon the door of another person—such is the prescription they %0a%3c give for these diseases! What deceitful persons they must be %0a%3c if there is no truth in it! And how highly criminal, if they %0a%3c really do thus transfer diseases from one person to another! %0a%3c Some of them, again, whose practices are of a less guilty %0a%3c nature, recommend that the parings of all the finger-nails %0a%3c should be thrown at the entrance of ant-holes, the first ant to be %0a%3c taken which attempts to draw one into the hole; this, they say, %0a%3c must be attached to the neck of the patient, and he will ex¬ %0a%3c perience a speedy cure. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHiP. 24.

The rest are %0a%3c 40 See B. vii. c. 13. x 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SOS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural histort. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of a most execrable and infamous nature, such, in fact, as to %0a%3c make me hasten to close my description of the remedies de¬ %0a%3c rived from man : we yvill therefore proceed to speak of the more %0a%3c remarkable animals, and the effects produced by them. The %0a%3c blood of the elephant, the male in particular, arrests all those %0a%3c defluxions known by the name of “ rheumatismi.” Ivory %0a%3c shavings, it is said, in combination with Attic honey, are good %0a%3c for the removal of spots upon the face : with the sawdust, too, %0a%3c of ivory, hangnails are removed. By the touch of an elephant’s %0a%3c trunk head-ache is alleviated, if the animal happens to sneeze %0a%3c at the time more particularly. The right side of the trunk, %0a%3c attached to the body with red earth of Lemnos, acts powerfully %0a%3c as an aphrodisiac. Elephant’s blood is good for consumption, %0a%3c and the liver for epilepsy. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25.-TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE LION. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lion’s fat, mixed with oil of roses, protects the skin of the %0a%3c face from all kinds of spots, and preserves the whiteness of the %0a%3c complexion; it is remedial also for such parts of the body as %0a%3c have been frozen by snow, and for swellings in the joints. The %0a%3c frivolous lies of the magicians assert that persons who are %0a%3c anointed with lion’s fat, will more readily win favour with %0a%3c kings and peoples; more particularly when the fat has been %0a%3c used that lies between the eyebrows of the animal—a place, in %0a%3c fact, where there is no fat to be found ! The like effects they %0a%3c promise also from the possession of a lion’s tooth, one from the %0a%3c right side in particular, as also the shaggy hairs that are %0a%3c found upon the lower jaw. The gall, used as an ointment in %0a%3c combination with water, improves the eyesight, and, employed %0a%3c with the fat of the same animal, is a cure for epilepsy ; but %0a%3c a slight taste only must be taken of it, and the patient must %0a%3c run immediately after swallowing it, in order to digest it. A %0a%3c lion’s heart, used as food, is curative of quartan fevers, and %0a%3c the fat, taken with oil of roses, of quotidian fevers. Wild %0a%3c beasts will fly from persons anointed with lion’s fat, and it is %0a%3c thought to be a preservative even against treacherous practices. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 26.-TEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CAMEL. %0a%3c %0a%3c A camel’s 41 brains, dried and taken in vinegar, are a cure, they %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Pliny has omitted the milk of the camel, which, according to Taver¬ %0a%3c nier, is an excellent cure for dropsy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 27.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HYJ2NA. 309 %0a%3c %0a%3c say, for epilepsy: the same, too, with the gall, taken with %0a%3c honey ; which is a remedy also for quinzy. A camel’s tail %0a%3c dried, it is said, is productive of diarrhoea, and ashes of burnt %0a%3c camel’s dung, mixed with oil, make the hair curl. These %0a%3c ashes, applied topically, are very useful for dysentery, as also %0a%3c taken in drink, the proper dose being a pinch in three fingers %0a%3c at a time ; they are curative also of epilepsy. Camel’s urine %0a%3c it is said, is very useful to fullers, and is good for the cure of %0a%3c running sores. Barbarous nations, we are told, are in the habit %0a%3c of keeping it till it is five years old, and then taking it as a %0a%3c purgative, in doses of one semisextarius. The hairs of the %0a%3c tail, it is said, plaited and attached to the left arm, are a cure %0a%3c for quartan fevers. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27.—SEVENTY-NINE EEMED1ES DEEIVED FROM THE HYASNA. %0a%3c %0a%3c But of all animals, it is the hyaena that has been held in %0a%3c the highest admiration by the magicians, who have gone so %0a%3c far as to attribute to it certain magical virtues even, and the %0a%3c power of alluring 42 human beings and depriving them of their %0a%3c senses. Of its change of sex each year, and other monstrous %0a%3c peculiarities 43 in its nature, we have spoken already ; 44 we %0a%3c will now proceed to describe the medicinal virtues that are %0a%3c ascribed to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hyaena, it is said, is particularly terrible to panthers; so %0a%3c much so, indeed, that they will not attempt to make the slight¬ %0a%3c est resistance to it, and will never attack a man who has any %0a%3c portion of a hyaena’s skin about him. A thing truly marvel¬ %0a%3c lous to tell of, if the hides of these two animals are hung up %0a%3c facing one another, the hair will fall from off 1 the panther’s skin! %0a%3c "When the hyaena flies before the hunter, it turns off on the %0a%3c right, and letting the man get before it, follows in his track ; %0a%3c should it succeed in doing which, the man is sure to lose his %0a%3c senses and fall from his horse even. But if, on the other hand, %0a%3c it turns off to the left, it is a sign that the animal is losing %0a%3c strength, and that it will soon be taken. The easiest method, %0a%3c however, of taking it, they say, is for the hunter to tie his %0a%3c girdle with seven knots, and to make as many knots in the %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 See B. viii. c. 44. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 One peculiarity not mentioned by Pliny, is, that its skin, like that of %0a%3c the sea-calf, was said to be proof against the effects of lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 In B. viii. c. 44. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3)0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c whip with which he guides his horse. In addition to all this, %0a%3c so full of quirks and subtleties are the vain conceits of the %0a%3c magicians, they recommend the hyaena to be captured while %0a%3c the moon is passing through the sign of Gemini, and every %0a%3c hair of it to be preserved, if possible. They say, too, that the %0a%3c skin of the head is highly efficacious, if attached to a person %0a%3c suffering from head-ache; that the gall, applied to the fore¬ %0a%3c head, is curative of ophthalmia; and that if the gall is boiled %0a%3c down with three cyathi of Attic honey and one ounce of saffron, %0a%3c it will be a most effectual preservative against that disease, %0a%3c the same preparation being equally good for the dispersion of %0a%3c films on the eyes and cataract. If, again, this preparation is %0a%3c kept till it is old, it will be all the better for improving the %0a%3c sight, due care being taken to preserve it in a box of Cyprian %0a%3c copper : they assert also, that it is good for the cure of argema, %0a%3c eruptions and excrescences of the eyes, and marks upon those %0a%3c organs. For diseases 45 of the crystalline humours of the eyes, %0a%3c it is recommended to anoint them with the gravy of hyaena’s %0a%3c liver roasted fresh, incorporated with clarified honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c We learn also, from the same sources, that the teeth of the %0a%3c hyaena are useful for the cure of tooth-ache, the diseased tooth %0a%3c being either touched with them, or the animal’s teeth being %0a%3c arranged in their regular order, and attached to the patient; %0a%3c that the shoulders of this animal are good for the cure of pains %0a%3c in the arms and shoulders ; that the teeth, extracted from the %0a%3c left side of the jaw, and wrapped in the skin of a sheep or he- %0a%3c goat, are an effectual cure for pains in the stomach; that the %0a%3c lights of the animal, taken with the food, are good for cceliac %0a%3c affections; that the lights, reduced to ashes and applied with oil, %0a%3c are also soothing to the stomach; that the marrow of the back¬ %0a%3c bone, used with old oil and gall, is strengthening to the sinews; %0a%3c that the liver, tasted thrice just before the paroxysms, is good %0a%3c for quartan fevers ; that the ashes of the vertebrae, applied in %0a%3c hyaena’s skin with the tongue and right foot of a sea-calf and a %0a%3c bull’s gall, the whole boiled up together, are soothing for gout; %0a%3c that for the same disease hyaena’s gall is advantageously em¬ %0a%3c ployed in combination with stone of Assos; 46 that for cold shiver- %0a%3c ings, spasms, sudden fits of starting, and palpitations of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 “ Glaucomata.” Littre considers, on the authority of M.

In fits of delirium %0a%3c too, it is recommended to fumigate the patient with the smoke %0a%3c of one of these teeth, and to attach one in front of his chest, %0a%3c with the fat of the kidneys, or else the liver or skin. They %0a%3c assert also that a pregnant woman will never miscarry, if she %0a%3c wears suspended from her neck, the white flesh from a hyaena’s %0a%3c breast, with seven hairs and the genitals of a stag, the whole %0a%3c tied up in the skin of a gazelle. The genitals, they say, eaten %0a%3c with honey, act as a stimulant upon a person, according to %0a%3c the sex, and this even though it should be the case of a man %0a%3c who has manifested an aversion to all intercourse with females. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nay, even more than all this, we are assured that if the %0a%3c genitals and a certain joint of the vertebrae are preserved in %0a%3c a house with the hide adhering to them, they will ensure peace %0a%3c and concord between all members of the family ; hence it is %0a%3c that this part is known as the “joint of the spine ,” 47 or “ At- %0a%3c lantian 48 knot.” This joint, which is the first, is reckoned among %0a%3c the remedies for epilepsy. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fumes of the burnt fat of this animal will put ser¬ %0a%3c pents to flight, they say; and the jawbone, pounded with anise %0a%3c and taken with the food, is a cure for shivering fits. A fumi¬ %0a%3c gation made therewith has the effect of an emmenagogue ; and %0a%3c such are the frivolous and absurd conceits of the professors of %0a%3c the magic art, that they boldly assert that if a man attaches to %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 ' “ Spinae ” seems a preferable reading to “ ruinge,” adopted by Sillig. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 “ Nodum Atlantion.” From the Greek drKag, “ much enduring,” %0a%3c Julius Pollux says, because it was fitted for supporting burdens.

The left side of the brain, applied %0a%3c to the nostrils, is said to have a soothing effect upon all %0a%3c dangerous maladies either in men or beasts. They say, too, that %0a%3c the skin of the forehead is a preservative against all fascina¬ %0a%3c tions ; that the flesh of the neck, whether eaten or dried and %0a%3c taken in drink, is good for pains in the loins; that the sinews %0a%3c of the back and shoulders, used as a fumigation, are good for %0a%3c pains in the sinews; that the bristles of the snout, applied to %0a%3c a woman’s lips, have all the effect of a philtre; and that the %0a%3c liver, administered in drink, is curative of griping pains and %0a%3c urinary calculi. %0a%3c %0a%3c The heart, it is said, taken with the food or drink, is remedial %0a%3c for all kinds of pains in the body; the milt for pains in the %0a%3c spleen; the caul, in combination with oil, for inflammatory ul¬ %0a%3c cers ; and the marrow for pains in the spine and weakness in the %0a%3c sinews. The strings of the kidneys, they say, if taken with %0a%3c wine and frankincense, will restore fruitfulness, in cases where %0a%3c it has been banished through the agency of noxious 6pells; the %0a%3c uterus, taken in drink with the rind of a sweet pomegranate, %0a%3c is highly beneficial for diseases of the uterus ; and the fat of %0a%3c the loins, used as a fumigation, removes all impediments to %0a%3c delivery, and accelerates parturition. The marrow of the back, %0a%3c attached to the body as an amulet, is an effectual remedy for %0a%3c fantastic illusions, 60 and the genitals of the male animal, used %0a%3c as a fumigation, are good for the cure of spasms.

The left foot, if laid upon the body of a woman in travail, %0a%3c will be productive, they say, of fatal effects; but the right foot, %0a%3c similarly employed, will facilitate delivery.

If the door-posts are touched with this blood, %0a%3c the various arts of the magicians will be rendered of no effect; %0a%3c they will neither be able to summon the gods into their pre¬ %0a%3c sence nor to converse with them, whatever the method to which %0a%3c they have recourse, whether lamps or basin, water or globe, 52 %0a%3c or any other method. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh of the hyaena, taken as food, is said to be efficacious %0a%3c for the bite of a mad dog, and the liver still more so. The %0a%3c flesh or bones of a human being which have been found in the %0a%3c belly of a slain hyaena, used as a fumigation, are said to be %0a%3c remedial for gout: but if among these remains the nails are %0a%3c found, it is looked upon as a presage of death to some one among %0a%3c those who have captured it. The excrements or bones which %0a%3c have been voided by the animal at the moment when killed, %0a%3c are looked upon as counter-charms to magic spells. The dung %0a%3c found in the intestines is dried and administered in drink fox- %0a%3c dysentery ; and it is applied to all parts of the body with %0a%3c goose-grease, in the form of a liniment, in the case of persons %0a%3c who have received injury from some noxious medicament.

But the most extraordinary %0a%3c thing of all is, their assertion that the extremity of the rectum %0a%3c of this animal is a preservative against all oppression on the %0a%3c part of chiefs and potentates, and an assurance of success in all %0a%3c petitions, judgments, and lawsuits, and this, if a person only %0a%3c carries it about him.

The teeth of the right jaw of the amphibious croco¬ %0a%3c dile, attached to the right arm as an amulet, acts as an aphro¬ %0a%3c disiac, that is, if we choose to believe it. The eye-teeth of %0a%3c the animal, filled with frankincense—for they are hollow—are %0a%3c a cure for periodical fevers, care being taken to let the patient %0a%3c remain five days without seeing the person who has attached %0a%3c them to his body. A similar virtue is attributed to the small %0a%3c stones which are found in the belly of this animal, as being a %0a%3c check to the cold shiverings in fevers, when about to come on; %0a%3c and with the same object the ^Egyptians are in the habit of %0a%3c anointing their sick with the fat of the crocodile. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other kind of crocodile 54 resembles it, but is much in¬ %0a%3c ferior in size: it lives upon land only, and among the most %0a%3c odoriferous flowers ; hence it is that its intestines are so greatly %0a%3c in request, being filled as they are with a mass of agreeable %0a%3c perfumes. This substance is called “ crocodilea,” and it is %0a%3c looked upon as extremely beneficial for diseases of the eyes, %0a%3c and for the treatment of films and cataract, being applied with %0a%3c leek-juice in the form of an ointment. Applied with oil of %0a%3c Cyprus, 55 it removes blemishes growing upon the face; and, em¬ %0a%3c ployed with water, it is a cure for all those diseases, the %0a%3c nature of which it is to spread upon the face, while at the same %0a%3c time it restores the natural tints of the skin. An application %0a%3c of it makes freckles disappear, as well as all kinds of spots and %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 Identified by Ajasson with the chatmes, or common crocodile of the %0a%3c Nile. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 See B. viii. c. 38. Identified by Ajasson with the souchos of Geoffroy %0a%3c Saint-Hilaire. It is equally amphibious with the other ; and the account %0a%3c of its habits given by Pliny is probably founded on the fact that Upper %0a%3c Egypt, which it inhabits, is covered with a more aromatic vegetation than %0a%3c the other parts of that country. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 29.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CHAMELEON. 315 %0a%3c %0a%3c pimples; and it is taken for epilepsy, in doses of two oboli, in %0a%3c oxymel. Used in the form of a pessary it acts as an emmena- %0a%3c gogue. The best kind of crocodilea, is that which is the whitest, %0a%3c friable, and the lightest in weight: when rubbed between the %0a%3c fingers it should ferment like leaven. The usual method is %0a%3c to wash it, as they do white lead. It is sometimes adulterated %0a%3c with amylum 86 or with Cimolian earth, but the most common %0a%3c method of sophistication is to catch the crocodiles and feed %0a%3c them upon nothing but rice. It is recommended as one of %0a%3c the most efficient remedies for cataract to anoint the eyes with %0a%3c crocodile’s gall, incorporated with honey. We are assured %0a%3c also that it is highly beneficial for affections of the uterus to %0a%3c make fumigations with the intestines and rest of the body, or %0a%3c else to envelope the patient with wool impregnated with the %0a%3c smoke. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ashes of the skin of either crocodile, applied with vinegar %0a%3c to such parts of the body as are about to undergo an incision, %0a%3c or indeed the very smell of the skin when burning, will render %0a%3c the patient insensible to the knife. The blood of either croco¬ %0a%3c dile, applied to the eyes, effaces marks upon those organs and %0a%3c improves the sight. The body, with the exception of the head %0a%3c and feet, is eaten, boiled, for the cure of sciatica, and is found %0a%3c very useful for chronic coughs, in children more particularly : %0a%3c it is equally good, too, for the cure of lumbago. These animals %0a%3c have a certain fat also, which, applied to the hair, makes it fall %0a%3c off; persons anointed with this fat are effectually protected %0a%3c against crocodiles, and it is the practice to drop it into wounds %0a%3c inflicted by them. A crocodile’s heart, attached to the body %0a%3c in the wool of a black sheep without a speck of any other %0a%3c colour, due care too being taken that the sheep was the first %0a%3c lamb yeaned by its dam, will effectually cure a quartan fever, %0a%3c it is said. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 29. —FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE CHAMELEON. %0a%3c %0a%3c To these animals we shall annex some others that are equally %0a%3c foreign, and very similar in their properties. To begin then %0a%3c with the chamseleon, which Democritus has considered worthy %0a%3c to be made the subject of an especial work, and each part of %0a%3c which has been consecrated to some particular purpose—This %0a%3c book, in fact, has afforded me no small amusement, revealing %0a%3c 56 See B. xviii. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 316 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as it does, and exposing the lies and frivolities of the Greeks.— %0a%3c In size, the chamseleon resembles the crocodile last mentioned, %0a%3c and only differs from it in having the back-bone arched at u %0a%3c more acute angle, and a larger tail. There is no animal, it is %0a%3c thought, more 57 timid than this, a fact to which it owes its %0a%3c repeated changes of colour. 58 It has a peculiar ascendancy over %0a%3c the hawk tribe; for, according to report, it has the power of %0a%3c attracting those birds, when flying above it, and then leaving %0a%3c them a voluntary prey for other animals. Democritus 89 asserts %0a%3c that if the head and neck of a chamaeleon are burnt in a %0a%3c fire made with logs of oak, it will be productive of a storm %0a%3c attended with rain and thunder ; a result equally produced by %0a%3c burning the liver upon the tiles of a house. As to the rest of %0a%3c the magical virtues which he ascribes to this animal, we shall %0a%3c forbear to mention them, although we look upon them as un¬ %0a%3c founded ; 60 except, indeed, in some few instances where their %0a%3c very ridiculousness sufficiently refutes his assertions. %0a%3c %0a%3c The right eye, he says, taken from the living animal and %0a%3c applied with goats’ milk, removes diseases of the crystalline %0a%3c humours of the eyes; and the tongue, attached to the body as %0a%3c an amulet, is an effectual preservative against the perils of %0a%3c child-birth. He asserts also that the animal itself will facilitate %0a%3c parturition, if in the house at the moment; but if, on the %0a%3c other hand, it is brought from elsewhere, the consequences, he %0a%3c says, will be most dangerous. The tongue, he tells us, if taken %0a%3c from the animal alive, will ensure a favourable result to suits %0a%3c at law; and the heart, attached to the body with black wool %0a%3c of the first shearing, is a good preservative against the attacks %0a%3c of quartan fever. %0a%3c %0a%3c He states also that the right fore-paw, attached to the left %0a%3c arm in the skin of the hyaena, is a most effectual preserva¬ %0a%3c tive against robberies and alarms at night; that the pap on %0a%3c the right side is a preventive of fright and panics; that the %0a%3c left foot is sometimes burnt in a furnace with the plant which %0a%3c also has the name of “chamaeleon,” 61 and is then made up, with %0a%3c some unguent, into lozenges; and that these lozenges, kept in %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 It is a timid animal, but Pliny’s authorities have exaggerated its %0a%3c timidity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 This change of colour is in reality owing to change of locality. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 A.

As to the left shoulder of the chamseleon, I should %0a%3c be quite ashamed to say to what monstrous purposes Democri¬ %0a%3c tus devotes it; how that dreams may be produced by the %0a%3c agency thereof, and transferred to any person we may think %0a%3c proper; how that these dreams may be dispelled by the em¬ %0a%3c ployment of the right foot; and how that lethargy, which has %0a%3c been produced by the right foot of this animal, may be removed %0a%3c by .the agency of the left side. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, too, head-ache, he tells us, may be cured by sprinkling %0a%3c wine upon the head, in which either flank of a chamseleon has %0a%3c been macerated. If the feet are rubbed with the ashes of the %0a%3c left thigh or foot, mixed with sow’s milk, gout, he says, will %0a%3c be the result. It is pretty generally believed, however, that %0a%3c cataract and diseases of the crystalline humours of the eyes %0a%3c may be cured by anointing those organs with the gall for three %0a%3c consecutive days ; that serpents may be put to flight by drop¬ %0a%3c ping some of it into the fire ; that weasels may be attracted by %0a%3c water into which it has been thrown ; and that, applied to the %0a%3c body, it acts as a depilatory. The liver, they say, applied with %0a%3c the lungs of a bramble-frog, is productive of a similar effect: %0a%3c in addition to which, we are told that the liver counteracts the %0a%3c effects of philtres; that persons are cured of melancholy by %0a%3c drinking from the warm skin of a chamseleon the juice of %0a%3c the plant known by that name; and that if the intestines of %0a%3c the animal and their contents—we should bear in mind that %0a%3c in reality the animal lives without food 62 —are mixed with %0a%3c apes’ urine, and the doors of an enemy are besmeared with the %0a%3c mixture, he will, through its agency, become the object of %0a%3c universal hatred. %0a%3c %0a%3c We are told, too, that by the agency of the tail, the %0a%3c course of rivers and torrents may be stopped, and serpents %0a%3c struck with torpor; that the tail, prepared with cedar and %0a%3c myrrh, and tied to a double branch of the date-palm, will %0a%3c divide waters that are smitten therewith, and so disclose every- %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 See B. viii. c. 61.

It is quite evident that this %0a%3c philosopher, a man who has shown himself so sagacious in %0a%3c other respects, and so useful to his fellow-men, has been led %0a%3c away, in this instance, by too earnest a desire to promote the %0a%3c welfare of mankind. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 30.-POUR REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SCINCT8. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similar in appearance to the preceding animals is the %0a%3c scincus, 64 which by some writers has been called the land %0a%3c crocodile ; it is, however, whiter in appearance, and the skin is %0a%3c not so thick. But the main difference between it and the cro¬ %0a%3c codile is in the arrangement of the scales, which run from the %0a%3c tail towards the head. The largest of these animals is the Indian %0a%3c scincus, and next to it that of Arabia; they are brought here %0a%3c salted. The muzzle and fat of the scincus, taken in white %0a%3c •wine, act as an aphrodisiac; when used with satyrion 65 and %0a%3c rocket-seed more particularly, in the proportion of one drachma %0a%3c of each, mixed with two drachmae of pepper; the ■whole being %0a%3c made up into lozenges of one drachma each, and so taken in %0a%3c drink. The flesh from the flanks, taken internally in a similar %0a%3c manner, in doses of two oboli, with myrrh and pepper, is %0a%3c generally thought to be productive of a similar effect, and to %0a%3c be even more efficacious for the purpose. According to Apelles, %0a%3c the flesh of the scincus is good for wounds inflicted by poisoned %0a%3c arrows, whether taken before or after the wound is inflicted: %0a%3c it is used as an ingredient, also, in the most celebrated anti¬ %0a%3c dotes. Sextius tells us, that, taken in doses of more than one %0a%3c drachma, in one semisextarius of wine, the flesh is productive of %0a%3c deadly results: he adds, too, that a broth prepared from it, %0a%3c taken with honey, acts as an antaphrodisiac. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 31.—SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE HirPOPOTAMCS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Between the crocodile, too, and the hippopotamus there is a %0a%3c certain affinity, frequenting as they do the same river, and %0a%3c being both of them of an amphibious nature.

The skin of the left side of %0a%3c the forehead, attached to the groin, acts as an antaphrodisiac; and %0a%3c an application of the ashes of the same part will cause the hair %0a%3c to grow when lost through alopecy.

It is said %0a%3c that in the Isle of Carpathus a most powerful medicament is %0a%3c obtained by reducing to ashes the nails of the lynx, together %0a%3c with the hide ; that these ashes, taken in drink, have the %0a%3c effect of checking abominable desires in men; and that, if they %0a%3c are sprinkled upon women, all libidinous thoughts will be %0a%3c restrained. They are good too for the removal of itching %0a%3c sensations in any part of the body. The urine of the lynx is %0a%3c a remedy for strangury; for which reason the animal, it is %0a%3c said, is in the habit of rooting up the ground and covering it %0a%3c the moment it is voided. 67 It is mentioned, too, that this urine %0a%3c is an effectual remedy for pains in the throat. Thus much %0a%3c with reference to foreign animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 33. (9.)-REMEDIES FURNISHED IN COMMON BY ANIMALS %0a%3c %0a%3c OF THE SAME CLASS, WHETHER WILD OR TAME. FIFTY-FOUR %0a%3c %0a%3c MEDICINAL USES OF MILK, WITH OBSERVATIONS THEREON. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now return to our own part of the world, speaking, %0a%3c first of all, of certain remedies common to animals in general, %0a%3c but excellent in their nature; such as the use of milk, for %0a%3c example. The most beneficial milk to every creature is the %0a%3c mother’s 66 milk. It is highly dangerous for nursing women to %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 In B. viii. c. 40. 67 See B_. viii. e. 57. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 Except, of course, when the mother is in a state of disease. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 320 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVI11. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c conceive: children that are suckled by them are known among %0a%3c us as “ colostrati,” 69 their milk being thick, like cheese in ap¬ %0a%3c pearance—the name “ colostra,” 70 it should be remembered, is %0a%3c given to the first milk secreted after delivery, which assumes a %0a%3c spongy, coagulated form. The most nutritive milk, in all %0a%3c cases, is woman’s milk, and next to that goats’ milk, to which %0a%3c is owing, probably, the fabulous story that Jupiter was suckled %0a%3c by a goat. 71 The sweetest, next to woman’s milk, is camels’ %0a%3c milk ; but the most efficacious, medicinally speaking, is asses’ %0a%3c milk. It is in animals of the largest size and individuals %0a%3c of the greatest bulk, that the milk is secreted with the greatest %0a%3c facility. .Goats’ milk agrees the best with the stomach, that %0a%3c animal browsing more than grazing. Cows’ milk is considered %0a%3c more medicinal, while ewes’ milk is sweeter and more nutri¬ %0a%3c tive,- but not so well adapted to the stomach, it being more %0a%3c oleaginous than any other. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every kind of milk is more aqueous in spring than in sum¬ %0a%3c mer, and the same in all cases where the animal has grazed %0a%3c upon a new pasture. The best milk of all is that which adheres %0a%3c to the finger nail, when placed there, and does not run from off %0a%3c it. Milk is most harmless when boiled, more particularly if %0a%3c sea pebbles 73 have been boiled with it. Cows’ milk is the most %0a%3c relaxing, and all kinds of milk are less apt to inflate when %0a%3c boiled. Milk is used for all kinds of internal ulcerations, %0a%3c those of the kidneys, bladder, intestines, throat, and lungs in %0a%3c particular ; and externally, it is employed for itching sensations %0a%3c upon the skin, and for purulent eruptions, it being taken fasting %0a%3c for the purpose. We have already 73 stated, when speaking of %0a%3c the plants, how that in Arcadia cows’ milk is administered for %0a%3c phthisis, consumption, and cachexy. Instances are cited, also, %0a%3c of persons who have been cured of gout in the hands and feet, %0a%3c by drinking asses’ milk. %0a%3c %0a%3c To these various kinds of milk, medical men have added %0a%3c another, to which they have given the name of “ schiston;” 14 %0a%3c %0a%3c 09 See B. xi. c. 96. Dalcchamps remarks that Pliny is in error here: %0a%3c this name being properly given to infants which have been put to the breast %0a%3c too soon after child-birth. And so it would appear from the context. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 The “biestings.” 71 Amalthaea. %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 Dioscorides says “river pebbles." 73 In B. xxv. c. 53. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 From the Greek ox inT '°“divided ” milk, or “curds.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 33.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MEDICINAL USES OF MILK. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 321 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the following being the usual method of preparing it. Goats’ %0a%3c milk, which is used in preference for the purpose, is boiled in %0a%3c a new earthen vessel, and stirred with branches of a fig-tree %0a%3c newly gathered, as many cyathi of honied wine being added to %0a%3c it as there are semisextarii of milk. When the mixture boils, %0a%3c care is taken to prevent it running over, by plunging into it a %0a%3c silver cyathus measure filled with cold water, none of the water %0a%3c being allowed to escape. When taken off the fire, the constitu¬ %0a%3c ent parts of it divide as it cools, and the whey is thus separated %0a%3c from the milk. Some persons, again, take this whey, which is %0a%3c now very strongly impregnated with wine, and, after boiling %0a%3c it down to one third, leave it to cool in the open air. The %0a%3c best way of taking it, is in doses of one semisextarius, at stated %0a%3c intervals, during five consecutive days ; after taking it, riding %0a%3c exercise should be used by the patient. This whey is admi¬ %0a%3c nistered in cases of epilepsy, melancholy, paralysis, leprosy, %0a%3c elephantiasis, and diseases of the joints. %0a%3c %0a%3c Milk is employed as an injection where excoriations have %0a%3c been caused by the use of strong purgatives; in cases also %0a%3c where dysentery is productive of chafing, it is similarly em¬ %0a%3c ployed, boiled with sea pebbles or a ptisan of barley. Where, %0a%3c however, the intestines are excoriated, cows’ milk or ewes’ %0a%3c milk is the best. New milk is used as an injection for dysen¬ %0a%3c tery ; and in an unboiled state, it is employed for affections of %0a%3c the colon and uterus, and for injuries inflicted by serpents. It %0a%3c is also taken internally as an antidote to the venom of cantha- %0a%3c rides, the pine-caterpillar, the buprestis, and the salamander. %0a%3c Cows’ milk is particularly recommended for persons who have %0a%3c taken colchicum, hemlock, dorycnium, 75 or the flesh of the sea- %0a%3c hare; and asses’ milk, in cases where gypsum, white-lead, %0a%3c sulphur, 76 or quick-silver, have been taken internally. This %0a%3c last is good too for constipation attendant upon fever, and is %0a%3c remarkably useful as a gargle for ulcerations of the throat. It %0a%3c is taken, also, internally, by patients suffering from atrophy, for %0a%3c the purpose of recruiting their exhausted strength; as also in %0a%3c cases of fever unattended with head-ache. The ancients held %0a%3c it as one of their grand secrets, to administer to children, before %0a%3c taking food, a semisextarius of asses’ milk, or for want of that, %0a%3c goats’ milk; a similar dose, too, was given to children troubled %0a%3c 75 See B. xxi. c. 105. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' 6 He perhaps means a sulphate, and not sulphur, which is harmless. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL.

Milk, %0a%3c under other circumstances, is detrimental to persons suffering %0a%3c from head-ache, liver complaints, diseases of the spleen, and %0a%3c affections of the sinews; it is bad for fevers, also, vertigo— %0a%3c except, indeed, where it is required as a purgative—oppression of %0a%3c the head, coughs, and ophthalmia. Sows’ milk is extremely use¬ %0a%3c ful in cases of tenesmus, dysentery, and phthisis; authors have %0a%3c been found too, to assert that it is very wholesome for females. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 34.—TWELVE REMEDIES DEHIVED FROM CHEESE. %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already" 7 spoken of the different kinds of cheese %0a%3c when treating of the mamillae and other parts of animals. %0a%3c Sextius attributes the same properties to mares’ milk cheese %0a%3c that he does to cheese made of cows’ milk : to the former he %0a%3c gives the names of “ hippace.” Cheese is best for the sto¬ %0a%3c mach when not salted, or, in other words, when new cheese is %0a%3c used. Old [salted] cheese has a binding effect upon the %0a%3c bowels, and reduces the flesh, but is more wholesome to %0a%3c the stomach [than new salted cheese]. Indeed, we may pro¬ %0a%3c nounce of aliments in general, that salt meats reduce the system, %0a%3c while fresh food has a tendency to make flesh.

It is mostly made %0a%3c from cows’ milk, and hence its name ; 82 but the richest butter %0a%3c is that made from ewes’ milk. There is a butter made also %0a%3c from goats’ milk ; but previously to making it, the milk should %0a%3c first be warmed, in winter. In summer it is extracted from %0a%3c the milk by merely shaking it to and fro in a tall vessel, with %0a%3c a small orifice at the mouth to admit the air, but otherwise %0a%3c closely stopped, a little water 83 being added to make it curdle %0a%3c the sooner. The milk that curdles the most, floats upon the sur¬ %0a%3c face; this they remove, and, adding salt to it, give it the name %0a%3c of “oxygala.” 81 They then take the remaining part and boil %0a%3c it down in pots, and that portion of it which floats on the %0a%3c surface is butter, a substance of an oily nature. The more 88 %0a%3c rank it is in smell, the more highly it is esteemed. When old, %0a%3c it forms an ingredient in numerous compositions. It is of an %0a%3c astringent, emollient, repletive, and purgative nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 The people of Germany and Scythia, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 In this passage also it is generally supposed that he refers to the %0a%3c nomadic life of barbarous nations, in which multitudes of sheep and %0a%3c cattle constituted the chief wealth.

Beckmann %0a%3c suggests “aceti,” “vinegar.”— Hist. Inv. I. 505, Bohn’s Ed. %0a%3c %0a%3c w Beckmann says on this passage, “ What Pliny says respecting oxygala %0a%3c is attended with difficulties : aud I am fully persuaded that his words are %0a%3c corrupted, though I find no variations marked in MSS. by which this con¬ %0a%3c jecture can be supported.”— Hist. Inv. I. 505. He suggests another %0a%3c arrangement of the whole passage, but without improving it, for the diffi¬ %0a%3c culty would appear to be totally imaginary; as it is quite clear that by %0a%3c “oxygala,” or “sour milk," Pliny means the thickest part of the curd, %0a%3c which is first removed and then salted, forming probably a sort of cream %0a%3c cheese. Though his meaning is clear, he may very possibly give an %0a%3c erroneous description of the process. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 The remark of Holland on this passage is curious—“ Some would %0a%3c •mend this place, and for ‘ magis,’ ‘ more,’ put ‘ minus,’ ‘ less,’ in a con¬ %0a%3c trary sense; but I suppose he writeth in regard of barbarous people, who %0a%3c make more account of such ranke butyr: like as the uncivile Irish in %0a%3c these daies.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 324 print's NATURAL HISTORY.

There are two methods of %0a%3c keeping hogs’ lard, either salted or fresh ; indeed, the older it %0a%3c is, the better. The Greek writers have now given it the name %0a%3c of “ axungia,” 8 ' or axle-grease, in their works. Nor, in fact, %0a%3c is it any secret, why swine’s fat should be possessed of such %0a%3c marked properties, seeing that the animal feeds to such a great %0a%3c extent upon the roots of plants—owing too, to which, its dung %0a%3c is applied to such a vast number of purposes. It will be as %0a%3c well, therefore, to premise, that I shall here speak only of the %0a%3c hog that feeds in the open field, and no other; of which kind %0a%3c it is the female that is much the most useful—if she has never %0a%3c farrowed, more particularly. But it is the fat of the wild boar %0a%3c that is held in by far the highest esteem of all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The distinguishing properties, then, of swine’s-grease, are %0a%3c emollient, calorific, resolvent, and detergent. Some physicians %0a%3c recommend it as an ointment for the gout, mixed with goose- %0a%3c grease, bull-suet, and wool-grease: in cases, however, where %0a%3c the pain is persistent, it should be used in combination with %0a%3c wax, myrtle, resin, and pitch. Hogs’ lard is used fresh for %0a%3c the cure of burns, and of blains, too, caused by snow: with %0a%3c ashes of burnt barley and nutgalls, in equal proportions, it is em¬ %0a%3c ployed for the cure of chilblains. It is good also for excoriations %0a%3c of the limbs, and for dispelling weariness and lassitude arising %0a%3c from long journeys. For the cure of chronic cough, new %0a%3c lard is boiled down, in the proportion of three ounces to three %0a%3c %0a%3c He has forgotten to do so, however. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 .

Old %0a%3c lard too, if it has been kept without salt, made up into pills %0a%3c and taken internally, is a cure for phthisis: but it is a general %0a%3c rule not to use it salted in any cases except where detergents are %0a%3c required, or where there are no symptoms of ulceration. For %0a%3c the cure of phthisis, some persons boil down three ounces of %0a%3c hogs’ lard and honied wine, in three cyathi of ordinary wine ; %0a%3c and after swathing the sides, chest, and shoulders of the patient %0a%3c with compresses steeped in the preparation, administer to him, %0a%3c every four days, some tar with an egg: indeed, so potent is %0a%3c this composition, that if it is only attached to the knees even, %0a%3c the flavour of it will ascend to the mouth, and the patient %0a%3c will appear to spit it out, 88 as it were. %0a%3c %0a%3c The grease of a sow that has never farrowed, is the most %0a%3c useful of all cosmetics for the skin of females; but in all cases, %0a%3c hogs’ lard is good for the cure of itch-scab, mixed with pitch %0a%3c and beef-suet in the proportion of one-third, the whole being %0a%3c made lukewarm for the purpose. Fresh hogs’ lard, applied as %0a%3c a pessary, imparts nutriment to the infant in the womb, and %0a%3c prevents abortion. Mixed with white lead or litharge, it re¬ %0a%3c stores scars to their natural colour ; and, in combination with %0a%3c sulphur, it rectifies malformed nails. It prevents the hair also %0a%3c from falling off; and, applied with a quarter of a nutgall, it %0a%3c heals ulcers upon the head in females. When well smoked, it %0a%3c strengthens the eyelashes. Lard is recommended alsofor phthisis, %0a%3c boiled down with old wine, in the proportion of one ounce to a %0a%3c semisextarius, till only three ounces are left; some persons add %0a%3c a little honey to the composition. Mixed with lime, it is used %0a%3c as a liniment for inflamed tumours, boils, and indurations of %0a%3c the mamillse: it is curative also of ruptures, convulsions, %0a%3c cramps, and sprains. Used with white hellebore, it is good %0a%3c for corns, chaps, and callosities; and, with pounded earthen¬ %0a%3c ware 89 which has held salted provisions, for iraposthumes of %0a%3c the parotid glands and scrofulous sores. Employed as a fric¬ %0a%3c tion in the bath, it removes itching sensations and pimples : but %0a%3c for the treatment of gout there is another method of preparing %0a%3c it, by mixing it with old oil, and adding pounded sarcopha¬ %0a%3c gus 90 stone and cinquefoil bruised in wine, or else with lime %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 Hence it was a notion in the sixteenth century, that pitch and hogs’ %0a%3c lard is a cure for syphilis, by promoting salivation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 “"Farina salsamentariae testae.” 90 See B. xxxvi. c. 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 326 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Rook XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c or ashes. A peculiar kind of plaster is also made of it for the %0a%3c cure of inflammatory ulcers, seventy-five denarii of hogs’ lard %0a%3c being mixed with one hundred of litharge. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is reckoned a very good plan also to anoint ulcers with %0a%3c boars’ grease, and, if they are of a serpiginous nature, to add %0a%3c resin to the liniment. The ancients used to employ hogs’ lard %0a%3c in particular for greasing the axles of their vehicles, that the %0a%3c wheels might revolve the more easily, and to this, in fact, it owes %0a%3c its name of “ axungia.” When hogs’ lard has been used for this %0a%3c purpose, incorporated as it is with the rust of the iron upon %0a%3c the wheels, it is remarkably useful as an application for dis¬ %0a%3c eases of the rectum and of the generative organs. The ancient %0a%3c physicians, too, set a high value upon the medicinal properties %0a%3c of hogs’ lard in an unmixed state: separating it from the %0a%3c kidneys, and carefully removing the veins, they used to wash %0a%3c and rub it well in rain water, after which they boiled it several %0a%3c times in a new earthen vessel, and then put it by for keeping. %0a%3c It is generally agreed that it is more emollient, calorific, and %0a%3c resolvent, when salted; and that it is still more useful when %0a%3c it has been rinsed in wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Massurius informs us, that the ancients set the highest %0a%3c value of all upon the fat of the wolf: and that it was for this %0a%3c reason that the newly-wedded bride used to anoint the door¬ %0a%3c posts of her husband’s house with it, in order that no noxious %0a%3c spells might find admittance. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 38. —SUET. %0a%3c %0a%3c Corresponding with the grease of the swine, is the suet 91 that %0a%3c is found in the ruminating animals, a substance employed in %0a%3c other ways, but no less efficacious in its properties. The pro¬ %0a%3c per mode of preparing it, in all cases, is to take out the veins %0a%3c and to rinse it in sea or salt-water, after which it is beaten up %0a%3c in a mortar, with a sprinkling of sea-water in it. This done, %0a%3c it is boiled in several waters, until, in fact, it has lost all smell, %0a%3c and is then bleached by continual exposure to the sunthat of %0a%3c the most esteemed quality being the fat which grows about the %0a%3c kidneys. In case stale suet is required for any medicinal pur¬ %0a%3c pose, it is recommended to melt it first, and then to wash it in %0a%3c cold water several times; after which, it must again be melted %0a%3c with a sprinkling of the most aromatic wine that can be pro- %0a%3c 91 “ Sebum ”—Suet or tallow. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 40.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GALL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 327 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c cured, it being then boiled again and again, until the rank %0a%3c 6mell has totally disappeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c Many persons recommend that the fat of bulls, lions, pan¬ %0a%3c thers, and camels, in particular, should be thus prepared. As %0a%3c to the various uses to which these substances are applied, we %0a%3c shall mention them on the appropriate occasions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 39.-MARROW. %0a%3c %0a%3c Common too, to all these animals, is marrow ; a substance %0a%3c which in all cases is possessed of certain emollient, expletive, %0a%3c desiccative, and calorific properties. The most highly esteemed %0a%3c of all is deer’s marrow, the next best being that of the calf, and %0a%3c then that of the goat, both male and female. These substances %0a%3c are prepared before autumn, by washing them in a fresh state, %0a%3c and drying them in the shade ; after which they are passed %0a%3c through a sieve, and then strained through linen, and put by %0a%3c in earthen pots for keeping, in a cool spot. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40.-GALL. %0a%3c %0a%3c But among the substances which are furnished in common %0a%3c by the various animals, it is the gall, we may say, that is the %0a%3c most efficacious of all. The properties of this substance are of %0a%3c a calorific, pungent, resolvent, extractive, and dispersive nature. %0a%3c The gall of the smaller animals is looked upon as the most %0a%3c penetrating; for which reason it is that it is generally con¬ %0a%3c sidered the most efficacious for the composition of eye-salves. %0a%3c Bull’s gall is possessed of a remarkable degree of potency, %0a%3c having the effect of imparting a golden tint to the surface %0a%3c of copper even and to vessels made of other metals. Gall in every %0a%3c case is prepared in the following manner: it is taken fresh, %0a%3c and the orifice of the vesicle in which it is contained being tied %0a%3c fast with a strong linen thread* it is left to steep for half %0a%3c an hour in boiling water ; after which it is dried in the shade, %0a%3c and then put away for keeping, in honey. %0a%3c %0a%3c That of the horse is condemned, being reckoned among the %0a%3c poisons only. Hence it is that the Flamen 92 of the Sacrifices %0a%3c is not allowed to touch a horse, notwithstanding that it is the %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 Or Flamen Dialis. Festus gives another reason: lest the Flamen %0a%3c should travel to a distance, and so neglect his duties. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 328 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c custom to immolate one 93 of these animals at the public sacri¬ %0a%3c fices at Rome. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 41.—BLOOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c The blood, also, of the horse is possessed of certain corrosive %0a%3c properties ; and so, too, is mare’s blood—except, indeed, where %0a%3c the animal has not been covered—it having the effect of %0a%3c cauterizing the margins of ulcers, and so enlarging them. %0a%3c Bull’s blood too, taken fresh, is reckoned 94 among the poisons; %0a%3c except, indeed, at jEgira, 93 at which place the priestess of the %0a%3c Earth, when about to foretell coming events, takes a draught %0a%3c of bull’s blood before she descends into the cavern : so power- %0a%3c ful, in fact, is the agency of that sympathy so generally spoken %0a%3c of, that it may occasionally originate, we find, in feelings of re¬ %0a%3c ligious awe, 96 or in the peculiar nature of the locality. %0a%3c %0a%3c Drusus, 97 the tribune of the people, drank goats’ blood, it is %0a%3c said ; it being his object by his pallid looks to suggest that his %0a%3c enemy, Q.

So remarkably powerful is the blood of the he- %0a%3c goat, that there is nothing better in existence for sharpening %0a%3c iron implements, the rust produced by this blood giving them %0a%3c a better edge even than a file.

That deer are destructive to those reptiles 98 no one %0a%3c is ignorant; as also of the fact that they drag them from their %0a%3c holes when they find them, and so devour them. And it is %0a%3c not only while alive and breathing that deer are thus fatal to %0a%3c serpents, but even when dead and separated limb from limb. %0a%3c The fumes of their horns, while burning, will drive away %0a%3c serpents, as already 99 stated; but the bones, it is said, of the %0a%3c upper part of a stag’s throat, if burnt upon a fire, will bring those %0a%3c reptiles together. Persons may sleep upon a deer’s skin in %0a%3c perfect safety, and without any apprehension of attacks by %0a%3c serpents; its rennet too, taken with vinegar, is an effectual anti¬ %0a%3c dote to the stings of those reptiles ; indeed, if it has been only %0a%3c touched by a person, he will be for that day effectually pro¬ %0a%3c tected from them. The testes, dried, or the genitals of the %0a%3c male animal, are considered to be very wholesome, taken in %0a%3c wine, and so are the umbles, generally known as the “ centi- %0a%3c pellio.” 1 Persons having about them a deer’s tooth, or who %0a%3c have taken the precaution of rubbing the body with a deer or %0a%3c fawn’s marrow, will be sure to repel the attacks of all serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the most effectual remedy of all is thought to be the %0a%3c rennet of a fawn that has been cut from the uterus of the %0a%3c dam, as already 3 mentioned in another place. Deer’s blood, %0a%3c burnt upon a fire of lentisk wood, with dracontium, 3 cunilago, 4 %0a%3c and alkanet, will attract serpents, they say; while, on the %0a%3c other hand, if the blood is removed and pyrethrum 6 substituted %0a%3c for it, they will take to flight. %0a%3c %0a%3c I find an animal mentioned by Greek writers, smaller than %0a%3c the stag, but resembling it in the hail’, and to which they give %0a%3c the name of “ ophion.” 6 Sardinia, they say, is the only coun¬ %0a%3c try that produces it; I am of opinion, however, that it is now %0a%3c extinct, and for that reason I shall not enlarge upon its medi¬ %0a%3c cinal properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c (10.) As a preservative against the attacks of serpents, the %0a%3c brains and blood of the wild boar are held in high esteem: %0a%3c the liver also, dried and taken in wine with rue ; and the fat, %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 See B. viii. c. 50. 99 In B. viii. c. 50. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Or “ hundred skins.” Called the mirefeuilkt in French. %0a%3c %0a%3c * In B. viii. c. 50. 3 See B. xxiv. c. 91. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 See B. xx. c. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 The Antherais pyrethrum of Linnaeus, Spanish camomile or pellitory. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Possibly the Musiuou of B. viii. c. 49.

Similar properties are attributed %0a%3c to the liver of the domesticated boar and the outer filaments, %0a%3c and those only, of the gall, these last being taken in doses of %0a%3c four denarii; the brains also, taken in wine, are equally ef¬ %0a%3c fectual. The fumes of the burning horns or hair of a she-goat %0a%3c will repel serpents, they say: the ashes, too, of the horns, used %0a%3c either internally or externally, are thought to be an antidote %0a%3c to their poison. A similar effect is attributed to goats’ milk, %0a%3c taken with Taminian 1 grapes ; to the urine of those animals, %0a%3c taken with squill vinegar; to goats’ milk cheese, applied with %0a%3c origanum ; 8 and to goat suet, used with wax. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to all this, as will be seen hereafter, there are a %0a%3c thousand other remedial properties attributed to this animal; %0a%3c a fact which surprises me all the more, seeing that the goat, %0a%3c it is said, is never free from fever. 9 The w r ild animals of the %0a%3c same species, which are very numerous, as already 10 stated, %0a%3c have a still greater efficacy attributed to them; but the he- %0a%3c goat has certain properties peculiar to itself, and Democritus %0a%3c attributes properties Btill more powerful to the animal when it %0a%3c has been the only one yeaned. It is recommended also to apply %0a%3c she-goat’s dung, boiled 11 in vinegar, to injuries inflicted by %0a%3c serpents, as also the ashes of fresh dung mixed with wine. %0a%3c As a general rule, persons who find that they are recovering %0a%3c but slowly from injuries inflicted by a serpent, will find their %0a%3c health more speedily re-established by frequenting the stalls %0a%3c where goats are kept. Those, however, whose object is a more %0a%3c assured remedy, attach immediately to the "wound the paunch %0a%3c of a she-goat killed for the purpose, dung and all. Others, %0a%3c again, use the flesh of a kid just killed, and fumigate it with %0a%3c the singed hair, the smell of which has the effect of repelling %0a%3c serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c For stings of serpents, as also for injuries inflicted by the %0a%3c scorpion and shrew-mouse, some employ the skin of a goat %0a%3c newly killed, as also the flesh and dung of a horse that has %0a%3c been out at pasture, or a hare’s rennet in vinegar. They say, %0a%3c too, that if a person has the body well rubbed with a hare’s %0a%3c rennet, he will never receive injury from venomous animals. %0a%3c When a person has been stung by a scorpion, she-goat’s dung, %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 See B. xxiii. cc. 13, 14. 8 See B. xx. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 See B. viii. c. 76. 10 In B. viii. c. 76. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 A remedy of which H.

It is considered an excellent %0a%3c plan too, to fumigate persons, when stung by a scorpion, with %0a%3c the 6moke of burnt calves’ dung. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 43. —REMEDIES FOE THE BITE OF THE MAD DOG. KEMED1ES %0a%3c %0a%3c DERIVED FROM THE CAiF, THE HE-GOAT, AND VARIOUS OTHER %0a%3c %0a%3c ANIMALS. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a person has been bitten by a mad dog, it is the %0a%3c practice to make an incision round the wound to the quick, %0a%3c and then to apply raw veal to it, and to make the patient %0a%3c take either veal broth or hogs’ lard, mixed with lime internally. %0a%3c Some persons recommend a he-goat’s liver, and maintain that %0a%3c if it is applied to the wound the patient will never be attacked %0a%3c with hydrophobia. She-goat’s dung, too, is highly spoken of, %0a%3c applied with wine, as also the dung of the badger, cuckoo, and %0a%3c swallow, boiled and taken in drink. %0a%3c %0a%3c For bites inflicted by other animals, dried goats’ milk cheese %0a%3c is applied with origanum and taken with the drink; and for %0a%3c injuries caused by the human 12 teeth, boiled beef is applied; %0a%3c veal, however, is still more efficacious for the purpose, provided %0a%3c it is not removed before the end of four days. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 44. —REMEDIES TO BE ADOPTED AGAINST ENCHANTMENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The dried muzzle of a wolf, they say, is an effectual preser¬ %0a%3c vative against the malpractices of magic; and it is for this %0a%3c reason that it is so commonly to be seen fastened to the doors of %0a%3c farm-houses. A similar degree of efficacy, it is thought, %0a%3c belongs to the skin of the neck, when taken whole from the %0a%3c animal. Indeed, so powerful is the influence of this animal, %0a%3c in addition to what we have already 13 stated, that if a horse %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Cloquet says that the application would be useless. %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 In b. viii. c. 34. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 332 PLINY’S NATTJBAL HISTOBY.

Poisons are neutralized by %0a%3c taking asses’ milk; henbane more particularly, mistletoe, hem¬ %0a%3c lock, the flesh of the sea-hare, opocarpathon , 16 pharicon , 17 and %0a%3c dorycnium : 18 the same, too, where coagulated milk 19 has been %0a%3c productive of bad effects, for the biestings , 20 or first curdled %0a%3c milk, should be reckoned as nothing short of a poison . 21 We %0a%3c shall have to mention many other uses to which asses’ milk is %0a%3c applied ; but it should be remembered that in all cases it must %0a%3c be used fresh, or, if not, as new as possible, and warmed, for %0a%3c there is nothing that more speedily loses its virtue. The %0a%3c bones, too, of the ass are pounded and boiled, as an antidote to %0a%3c the poison of the sea-hare. The wild ass 22 is possessed of %0a%3c similar properties in every, respect, but in a much higher %0a%3c degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the wild horse 23 the Greek writers have made no mention, %0a%3c it not being a native of their country ; we have every reason to %0a%3c believe, however, that it has the same properties as the animal %0a%3c in a tame state, but much more fully developed. Mares’ milk %0a%3c effectually neutralizes the venom of the sea-hare and all %0a%3c narcotic poisons. Nor had the Greeks any knowledge from %0a%3c experience of the urus 24 and the bison , 24 although in India the %0a%3c forests are filled with herds of wild oxen : it is only reasonable, %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 Cloquet and Ajasson admit the truth of this statement: the latter %0a%3c suggests that it may be owing to electricity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 It is no longer reckoned among the poisons. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 Juice of carpathum, a substance which does not appear to have been %0a%3c identified; but supposed by Bruce to have been a gum called sassa, with %0a%3c which aloes are adulterated in Abyssinia, a thing that Galen tells us was %0a%3c done with the carpathum of the ancients.

It is asserted also, that cows’ milk is a general %0a%3c counter-poison, in the cases above-mentioned, more particularly, %0a%3c as also where the poison of ephemeron 25 has settled internally, %0a%3c or cantharides have been administered ; it acting upon the %0a%3c poison by vomit. Broth, too, made from goats’ flesh, neutral¬ %0a%3c izes the effects of cantharides, in a similar manner, it is said. %0a%3c To counteract the corrosive poisons which destroy by ulcer¬ %0a%3c ation, veal or beef-suet is resorted to; and in cases where a %0a%3c leech has been swallowed, butter is the usual remedy, with %0a%3c vinegar heated with a red-hot iron. Indeed, butter employed %0a%3c by itself is a good remedy for poisons, for where oil is not %0a%3c to be procured, it is an excellent substitute for it. Used with %0a%3c honey, butter heals injuries inflicted by millepedes. The %0a%3c broth of boiled tripe, it is thought, is an effectual repellent of %0a%3c the above-mentioned poisons, aconite and hemlock more par¬ %0a%3c ticularly ; veal-suet also has a similar repute. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fresh goats’ milk cheese is given to persons who have taken %0a%3c mistletoe, and goats’ milk itself is a remedy for cantharides. %0a%3c Taken with Taminian 26 grapes, goats’ milk is an antidote to the %0a%3c effects of ephemeron. Goats’ blood, boiled down with the mar¬ %0a%3c row, is used as a remedy for the narcotic 21 poisons, and kids’ blood %0a%3c for the other poisons. Kid’s rennet is administered where per¬ %0a%3c sons have taken mistletoe, the juice of the white chamseleon, 28 %0a%3c or bull’s blood; for which last, hare’s rennet in vinegar is also %0a%3c used by way of antidote. For injuries inflicted by the pasti- %0a%3c naca, 29 and the stings or bites of all kinds of marine animals, %0a%3c hare’6 rennet, kid’s rennet, or lamb’s rennet is taken, in doses %0a%3c of one drachma, in wine. Hare’s rennet, too, generally forms %0a%3c an ingredient in the antidotes for poisons. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moth that is seen fluttering about the flame of a lamp %0a%3c is generally reckoned in the number of the noxious substances : %0a%3c its bad effects are neutralized by the agency of goat’s liver. %0a%3c Goat's gall, too, is looked upon as an antidote to venomous %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 See B. sxv. c. 107, and B. xxvi. c. 75. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See B. xxiii. cc. 13, 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 “Toxica”—properly, those poisons in which the barbarous nations %0a%3c dipped their arrows. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See B. xxii. c. 21. 29 Or, sting-ray. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 334 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c preparations from the field weazel. 30 But we will now return %0a%3c to the other remedies, classified according to the various diseases. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 46. (11.) -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE HEAD, ANU %0a%3c %0a%3c FOR ALOPECY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bears’ grease, 31 mixed with ladanum 32 and the plant adi- %0a%3c antum, 33 prevents the hair from falling off; it is a cure also %0a%3c for alopecy and defects in the eyebrows, mixed with the fungus %0a%3c from the wick of a lamp, and the soot that is found in the %0a%3c nozzle. Used with wine, it is good for the cure of porrigo, a %0a%3c malady which is also treated with the ashes of deer’s horns in %0a%3c wine: this last substance also prevents the growth of vermin %0a%3c in the hair. For porrigo some persons employ goat’s gall, in %0a%3c combination with Cimolian chalk and vinegar, leaving the pre- %0a%3c pration to dry for a time on the head. Sow’s gall, too, mixed %0a%3c with bull’s urine, is employed for a similar purpose ; and when %0a%3c old, it is an effectual cure, with the addition of sulphur, for %0a%3c furfuraceous eruptions. The ashes, it is thought, of an ass’s %0a%3c genitals, will make the hair grow more thickly, and prevent it %0a%3c from turning grey ; the proper method of applying it being to %0a%3c shave the head and to pound the ashes in a leaden mortar with %0a%3c oil. Similar effects are attributed to the genitals of an ass’s %0a%3c foal, reduced to ashes and mixed with urine ; some nard being %0a%3c added to render the mixture less offensive. In cases of alopecy %0a%3c the part affected is rubbed with bull’s gall, warmed with %0a%3c Egyptian alum. Running ulcers of the head are successfully %0a%3c treated with bull’s urine, or stale human urine, in combination %0a%3c with cyclaminos 34 and sulphur : but the most effectual remedy is %0a%3c calf’s gall, a substance which, heated with vinegar, has also the %0a%3c effect of exterminating lice. Yeal suet, pounded with salt and %0a%3c applied to ulcers of the head, is a very useful remedy : the fat, %0a%3c too, of the fox is highly spoken of, but the greatest value is %0a%3c set upon cats’ dung, applied in a similar manner with mustard. %0a%3c %0a%3c Powdered goats’ horns, or the horns reduced to ashes, those %0a%3c of the he-goat in particular, with the addition of nitre, tama¬ %0a%3c risk-seed, butter, and oil, are remarkably effectual for prevent¬ %0a%3c ing the hair from coming off, the head being first shaved for %0a%3c the purpose. So too, the ashes of burnt goats’ flesh, applied %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 See B. xxix. c. 16. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 This substance still maintains its reputation, as preservative of the %0a%3c %0a%3c hair. 32 See B. xii. c. 37, and B. xxvi. c. 30. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 See B. xxii. c. 30. 34 See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 47.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES FOR THE EYES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 335 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the eye-brows -with oil, impart to them a black tint. By %0a%3c using goats’ milk, they say, lice may be exterminated; and the %0a%3c dung of those animals, with honey, is thought to be a cure for %0a%3c alopecy : the ashes, too, of the hoofs, mixed with pitch, prevent %0a%3c the hair from coming off. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ashes of a burnt hare, mixed with oil of myrtle, alle¬ %0a%3c viate head-ache, the patient drinking some water that has %0a%3c been left in the trough after an ox or ass has been drinking %0a%3c there. The male organs of a fox, worn as an amulet, are %0a%3c productive, if we choose to believe it, of a similar effect: the %0a%3c same, too, with the ashes of a burnt deer’s horn, applied with %0a%3c vinegar, rose oil, or oil of iris. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 47. -REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE EYES. %0a%3c %0a%3c For defluxions 35 of the eyes, beef suet, boiled with oil, is %0a%3c applied to the parts affected; and for eruptions of those organs, %0a%3c ashes of burnt deer’s horns are similarly employed, the tips of %0a%3c the horns being considered the most effectual for the purpose. %0a%3c For the cure of cataract, it is reckoned a good plan to apply %0a%3c a wolf’s excrements: the same substance, too, reduced to %0a%3c ashes, is used for the dispersion of films, in combination with %0a%3c Attic honey. Bear’s gall, too, is similarly employed ; and for %0a%3c the cure of epinyctis, wild boar’s lard, mixed with oil of %0a%3c roses, is thought to be very useful. An ass’s hoof, reduced to %0a%3c ashes and applied with asses’ milk, is used for the removal of %0a%3c marks in the eyes and indurations of the crystalline humours. %0a%3c Beef marrow, from the right fore leg, beaten up with soot, %0a%3c is employed for affections of the eyebrows, and for diseases %0a%3c of the eyelids and corners of the eyes. For the same purpose, %0a%3c also, a sort of calliblepharon 36 is prepared from soot, the best %0a%3c of all being that made from a wick of papyrus mixed with %0a%3c oil of sesame ; the soot being removed with a feather and %0a%3c caught in a new vessel prepared for the purpose. This mix¬ %0a%3c ture, too, is very efficacious for preventing superfluous eye¬ %0a%3c lashes from growing again when once pulled out. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bull’s gall is made up into eye-salves 37 with white of egg, %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 If they are occasioned by irritation, Ajasson thinks that Pliny’s re¬ %0a%3c medy may be of some utility. %0a%3c %0a%3c M A cosmetic for “ beautifying the eye-brows.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 “Collyria.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 336 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’S natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c these salves being steeped in water and applied to the eyes for %0a%3c four days successively. Veal suet, with goose-grease and the %0a%3c extracted juice of ocimum, is remarkably good for diseases of %0a%3c the eye-lids. Veal marrow, with the addition of an equal %0a%3c proportion of wax and oil or oil of roses, an egg being added %0a%3c to the mixture, is used as a liniment for indurations of the eye¬ %0a%3c lids. Soft goats’ milk cheese is used as an application, with %0a%3c warm water, to allay defluxions of the eyes; but when they %0a%3c are attended with swelling, honey is used instead of the water. %0a%3c In both cases, however, the eyes should be fomented with %0a%3c warm whey. In cases of dry ophthalmia, it is found a very %0a%3c useful plan to take the muscles 38 lying within a loin of pork, %0a%3c and, after reducing them to ashes, to pound and apply them to %0a%3c the part affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c She-goats, they say, are never affected with ophthalmia, %0a%3c from the circumstance that they browse upon certain kinds of %0a%3c herbs: the same, too, with the gazelle. Hence it is that we %0a%3c find it recommended, at the time of new moon, to swallow the %0a%3c dung of these animals, coated with wax. As they are able to %0a%3c see, too, by night, it is a general belief that the blood of a he- %0a%3c goat is a cure for those persons affected with dimness of sight %0a%3c to whom the Greeks have given the name of “ nyctalopes .”' 19 %0a%3c A similar virtue is attributed to the liver of a she-goat, boiled %0a%3c in astringent wine. Some are in the habit of rubbing the eyes %0a%3c with the thick gravy 40 which exudes from a she-goat’s liver %0a%3c roasted, or with the gall of that animal: they recommend the %0a%3c flesh also as a diet, and say that the patient should expose %0a%3c his eyes to the fumes of it while boiling: it is a general %0a%3c opinion, too, that the animal should be of a reddish colour. %0a%3c Another prescription is, to fumigate the eyes with the steam %0a%3c arising from the liver boiled in an earthen jar, or, according to %0a%3c some authorities, roasted. %0a%3c %0a%3c Goats’ gall is applied for numerous purposes: with honey, %0a%3c for films upon the eyes; with one-third part of white hellebore, %0a%3c for cataract; with wine, for spots upon the eyes, indurations of %0a%3c the cornea, films, webs, and argema; with extracted juice %0a%3c of cabbage, for diseases of the eyelids, the hairs being first %0a%3c pulled out, and the preparation left to dry on the parts affected; %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 This is the translation suggested by Dalechamps for “ lumbulis.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 “ Seers by night.” u “ Same.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 48.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES FOE THE EARS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 337 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and with woman's milk, for rupture of the coats of the eye. %0a%3c For all these purposes, the gall is considered the most effica¬ %0a%3c cious, when dried. Nor is the dung of this animal held in %0a%3c disesteem, being applied with honey for defluxions of the eyes. %0a%3c The marrow, too, of a goat, or a hare’s lights, we find used %0a%3c for pains in the eyes; and the gall of a goat, with raisin wine %0a%3c or honey, for the dispersion of films upon those organs. It is %0a%3c recommended also, for ophthalmia, to anoint the eyes with %0a%3c wolf’s fat or swine’s marrow : we find it asserted, too, that per¬ %0a%3c sons who carry a wolf’s tongue, inserted in a bracelet, will %0a%3c always be exempt from ophthalmia. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48 . -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES AND AFFECTIONS OF %0a%3c %0a%3c THE EARS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pains and diseases of the ears are cured by using the urine %0a%3c of a wild boar, kept in a glass vessel, or the gall of a wild %0a%3c boar, swine, or ox, mixed with castor-oil and oil of roses in %0a%3c equal proportions. But the best remedy of all is bull’s gall, %0a%3c warmed with leek juice, or with honey, if there is any suppu¬ %0a%3c ration. Bull’s gall too, warmed by itself in a pomegranate %0a%3c rind, is an excellent remedy for offensive exhalations from the %0a%3c ears: in combination with woman’s milk, it is efficacious as a %0a%3c cure for ruptures of those organs. Some persons are of opinion %0a%3c that it is a good plan to wash the ears with this preparation in %0a%3c cases where the hearing is affected ; while others again, after %0a%3c washing the ears with warm water, insert a mixture composed %0a%3c of the old slough of a serpent and vinegar, wrapped up in a %0a%3c dossil of wool. In cases, however, where the deafness is very %0a%3c considerable, gall warmed in a pomegranate rind with myrrh %0a%3c and rue, is injected into the ears; sometimes, also, fat bacon %0a%3c is used for this purpose, or fresh asses’ dung, mixed with oil %0a%3c of roses: in all cases, however, the ingredients should be %0a%3c warmed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The foam from a horse’s mouth is better still, or the ashes %0a%3c of fresh horse dung, mixed with oil of roses : fresh butter too %0a%3c is good; beef-suet mixed -with goose-grease; the urine of a %0a%3c bull or she-goat; or fullers’ lant, heated to such a degree that %0a%3c the steam escapes by the neck of the vessel. For this purpose %0a%3c also, one third part of vinegar is mixed with a small portion of %0a%3c the urine of a calf, which has not begun to graze. They apply %0a%3c also to the ears calf’s dung, mixed with the gall of that animal %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. V.

Veal-suet, too, is used, with goose-grease and extract of %0a%3c ocimum; or else veal marrow, mixed with bruised cummin %0a%3c and injected into the ears. For pains in the ears, the liquid %0a%3c ejected by a boar in copulation is used, due care being taken to %0a%3c receive it before it falls to the ground. For fractures of the %0a%3c ears, a glutinous composition is made from the genitals of a %0a%3c calf, which is dissolved in water when used; and for other %0a%3c diseases of those organs, foxes’ fat is employed, goat’s gall %0a%3c mixed with rose-oil warmed, or else extracted juice of leeks: %0a%3c in all cases where there is any rupture, these preparations are %0a%3c used in combination with woman’s milk. Where a patient is %0a%3c suffering from hardness of hearing, ox-gall is employed, with %0a%3c the urine of a he or she-goat; the same, too, where there is %0a%3c any suppuration. %0a%3c %0a%3c Whatever the purpose for which they are wanted, it is the %0a%3c general opinion that these substances are more efficacious when %0a%3c they have been smoked in a goat’s horn for twenty days. %0a%3c Hare’s rennet, too, is highly spoken of, taken in Aminean 41 %0a%3c wine, in the proportion of one third of a denarius of rennet to %0a%3c one half of a denarius of saeopenum . 43 Bears’ grease, mixed %0a%3c with equal proportions of wax and bull-suet, is a cure for %0a%3c imposthumes of the parotid glands: some persons add hy- %0a%3c pocisthis 43 to the composition, or else content themselves with %0a%3c employing butter only, after first fomenting the parts affected %0a%3c with a decoction of fenugreek, the good effects of which are %0a%3c augmented by strychnos. The testes, too, of the fox, are very %0a%3c useful for this purpose; as also bull’s blood, dried and reduced %0a%3c to powder. She-goats’ urine, made warm, is used as an injec¬ %0a%3c tion for the ears; and a liniment is made of the dung of those %0a%3c animals, in combination with axle-grease. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 49 . -REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACHE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ashes of deer's horns strengthen loose teeth and allay %0a%3c tooth-ache, used either as a friction or as a gargle. Some persons, %0a%3c however, are of opinion that the horn, unburnt and reduced to %0a%3c powder, is still more efficacious for all these purposes. Denti¬ %0a%3c frices are made both from the powder and the ashes.

For %0a%3c the cure of tooth-ache, hare’s rennet is injected into the ear : %0a%3c the head also of that animal, reduced to ashes, is used in the %0a%3c form of a dentifrice, and, with the addition of nard, is a correc¬ %0a%3c tive of bad breath. Some persons, however, think it a better %0a%3c plan to mix the ashes of a mouse’s head with the dentifrice. %0a%3c In the side of the hare there is a bone found, similar to a %0a%3c needle in appearance : for the cure of tooth-ache it is recom¬ %0a%3c mended to scarify the gums with this bone. The pastern-bone %0a%3c of an ox, ignited and applied to loose teeth which ache, has %0a%3c the effect of strengthening them in the sockets ; the same bone, %0a%3c reduced to ashes, and mixed with myrrh, is also used as a denti¬ %0a%3c frice. The ashes of burnt pig’s feet are productive of a similar %0a%3c effect, as also the calcined bones of the cotyloid cavities in which %0a%3c the hip-bones move. It is a well-known fact, that, introduced %0a%3c into the throat of beasts of burden, these bones are a cure for %0a%3c worms, and that, in a calcined state, they are good for strength¬ %0a%3c ening the teeth. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the teeth have been loosened by a blow, they are %0a%3c strengthened by using asses’ milk, or else ashes of the burnt %0a%3c teeth of that animal, or a horse’s lichen, reduced to powder, %0a%3c and injected into the ear with oil. By lichen 45 1 do not mean %0a%3c the hippomanes, a noxious substance which I purposely forbear %0a%3c to enlarge upon, but an excrescence which forms upon the %0a%3c knees of horses, and just above the hoofs. In the heart 40 of %0a%3c this animal there is also found a bone which bears a close %0a%3c resemblance to the eye-teeth of a dog : if the gums are scarified %0a%3c with this bone, or with a tooth taken from the jaw-bone of a %0a%3c dead horse, corresponding in place with the tooth affected, the %0a%3c pain will be removed, they say. Anaxilaiis assures us that if %0a%3c the liquid which exudes from a mare w r hen covered, is ignited %0a%3c on the wick of a lamp, it will give out a most marvellous %0a%3c representation 47 of horses’ heads ; and the same with reference %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 See B. xxi. c. 105. 45 See B. viii. c. 66. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 See B. xi. c. 70. Ajnsson remarks that this bone is only found in %0a%3c animals that have undergone much fatigue, and that it results from the %0a%3c consolidation of certain tendinous fibres which form the ligament of the heart. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 “ Capitum visus ” seems to be a more probable reading than “ capi- %0a%3c %0a%3c z 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 340 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIIr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the she-ass.

It is considered, %0a%3c also, a very efficacious remedy to wash the teeth with goats’ %0a%3c milk, or bull’s gall. The pastern-bones of a she-goat just %0a%3c killed, reduced to ashes, and indeed, to avoid the necessity for %0a%3c repetition, of any other four-footed beast reared in the farm¬ %0a%3c yard, are considered to make an excellent dentifrice. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 50 . ( 12 .) -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE FACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is generally believed that asses’ milk effaces wrinkles in %0a%3c the face, renders the skin more delicate, and preserves its white¬ %0a%3c ness : and it is a well-known fact, that some women are in the %0a%3c habit of washing their face with it seven 49 hundred times daily, %0a%3c strictly observing that number. Poppaea, the wife of the %0a%3c Emperor Nero, was the first to practise this; indeed, she had %0a%3c sitting-baths, prepared solely with asses’ milk, for which pur¬ %0a%3c pose whole troops of she-asses 50 used to attend her on her jour- %0a%3c nies. 51 Purulent eruptions on the face are removed by an %0a%3c application of butter, but white lead, mixed with the hutter, %0a%3c is an improvement. Pure butter, alone, is used for serpigi¬ %0a%3c nous eruptions of the face, a layer of barley-meal being pow¬ %0a%3c dered over it. The caul of a cow that has just calved, is %0a%3c applied, while still moist, to ulcers of the face. %0a%3c %0a%3c The following recipe may seem frivolous, but still, to please %0a%3c the women, 52 it must not be omitted; the pastern-bone of a %0a%3c white steer, they say, boiled forty days and forty nights, till it is %0a%3c %0a%3c turn usus ” given by Sillig.

Sun-burns and all other %0a%3c discolorations of the skin, are removed by the aid of calves’ %0a%3c dung kneaded up by hand with oil and gum ; ulcerations and %0a%3c chaps of the mouth, by an application of veal or beef-suet, %0a%3c mixed with goose-grease and juice of ocimum. There is %0a%3c another composition, also, made of veal - suet with stag’s %0a%3c marrow and leaves of white-thorn, the whole beaten up %0a%3c together. Marrow, too, mixed with resin, even if it be cow %0a%3c marrow only, is equally good; and the broth of cow-beef is %0a%3c productive of similar effects. A most excellent remedy for %0a%3c lichens on the face is a glutinous substance prepared from the %0a%3c genitals of a male calf, melted with vinegar and live sulphur, %0a%3c and stirred together with the branch of a fig-tree : this com¬ %0a%3c position is applied twice a day, and should be used quite fresh. %0a%3c This glue, similarly prepared from a decoction of honey and %0a%3c vinegar, is a cure for leprous spots, which are also removed by %0a%3c applying a he-goat’s liver warm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Elephantiasis, too, is removed by an application of goats’ %0a%3c gall; and leprous spots and furfuraceous eruptions by em¬ %0a%3c ploying bull’s gall with the addition of nitre, or else asses’ urine %0a%3c about the rising of the Dog-star. Spots on the face are re¬ %0a%3c moved by either bull’s gall or ass’s gall diluted in water by %0a%3c itself, care being taken to avoid the sun or w r ind after the skin %0a%3c has peeled off. A similar effect is produced, also, by using bull’s %0a%3c gall or calf’s gall, in combination with seed of cunila and the %0a%3c ashes of a deer’s horn, burnt at the rising of Canicula. %0a%3c %0a%3c Asses’ fat, in particular, restores the natural colour to scars %0a%3c and spots on the skin caused by lichen or leprosy. A he-goat’s %0a%3c gall, mixed with cheese, live sulphur, and sponge reduced %0a%3c to ashes, effectually removes freckles, the composition being %0a%3c brought to the consistency of honey before being applied. %0a%3c Some persons, however, prefer using dried gall, and mix with it %0a%3c warm bran, in the proportion of one obolus to four oboli of honey, %0a%3c the spots being rubbed briskly first.

It is used in the form of %0a%3c a gargle, warm from the udder or heated, goat’s milk being %0a%3c the best, boiled with mallows and a little salt. A broth made %0a%3c from tripe is an excellent gargle for ulcerations of the tongue and %0a%3c trachea; and for diseases of the tonsillary glands, the kidneys of a %0a%3c fox are considered a sovereign remedy, dried and beaten up with %0a%3c honey, and applied externally. For quinzy, bull’s gall or goat’s %0a%3c gall is used, mixed with honey. A badger’s liver, taken in %0a%3c water, is good for offensive breath, and butter has a healing %0a%3c effect upon ulcerations of the mouth. When a pointed or %0a%3c other substance has stuck in the throat, by rubbing it exter¬ %0a%3c nally with cats’ dung, the substance, they say, ■will either come %0a%3c up again or pass downwards into the stomach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Scrofulous sores are dispersed by applying the gall of a wild %0a%3c boar or of an ox, warmed for the purpose: but it is only when the %0a%3c sores are ulcerated that hare’s rennet is used, applied in a linen %0a%3c cloth with wine. The ashes of the burnt hoof of an ass or %0a%3c horse, applied with oil or water, is good for dispersing scrofu¬ %0a%3c lous sores; warmed urine also; the ashes of an ox’s hoof, %0a%3c taken in water; cow-dung, applied hot with vinegar; goat- %0a%3c suet with lime ; goats’ dung, boiled in vinegar; or the testes %0a%3c of a fox. Soap, 51 too, is very useful for this purpose, an %0a%3c invention of the Gauls for giving a reddish 55 tint to the hair. %0a%3c This substance is prepared from tallow and ashes, the best ashes %0a%3c for the purpose being those of the beech and yoke-elm : there %0a%3c are two kinds of it, the hard soap and the liquid, both of them %0a%3c much used by the people of Germany, the men, in particular, %0a%3c more than the women. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 See Beckmann’s Hist.

For the painful cramp, attended with %0a%3c inflexibility, to which people give the name of “ opisthotony,” %0a%3c the urine of a she-goat, injected into the ears, is found very %0a%3c useful; as also a liniment made of the dung of that animal, %0a%3c mixed with bulbs. %0a%3c %0a%3c In cases where the nails have been crushed, it is an excel¬ %0a%3c lent plan to attach to them the gall of any kind of animal. %0a%3c Whitlows upon the fingers should be treated with dried %0a%3c bull’s gall, dissolved in warm water. Some persons are in the %0a%3c babit of adding sulphur and alum, of each an equal weight. %0a%3c %0a%3c CnAP. 53. -REMEDIES FOR COUGH AND FOR SPITTING OF BLOOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c A wolf’s liver, administered in mulled wine, is a cure for %0a%3c cough; a bear’s gall also, mixed with honey; the ashes of the %0a%3c tips of a cow’s horn ; or else the saliva of a horse, taken in the %0a%3c drink for three consecutive days—in which last case the horse %0a%3c will be sure to die, they say. 66 A deer’s lights are useful for %0a%3c the same purpose, dried with the gullet of the animal in the %0a%3c 6moke, and then beaten up with honey, and taken daily as an %0a%3c electuary: the spitter 67 deer, be it remarked, is the kind that %0a%3c is the most efficacious for the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c Spitting of blood is cured by taking ashes of burnt deer’s %0a%3c horns, or else a hare’s rennet in drink, in doses of one-third %0a%3c of a denarius, with Samian earth and myrtle-wine. The dung %0a%3c of this last animal, reduced to ashes and taken in the evening, %0a%3c with wine, is good for coughs that are recurrent at night. %0a%3c Thesmoke, too, of a hare’s fur, inhaled, has the effect of bring¬ %0a%3c ing off from the lungs such humours as are difficult to be dis¬ %0a%3c charged by expectoration. Purulent ulcerations of the chest %0a%3c and lungs, and bad breath proceeding from a morbid state of %0a%3c the lungs, are successfully treated with butter boiled with an %0a%3c equal quantity of Attic honey till it assumes a reddish hue, a %0a%3c spoonful of the mixture being taken by the patient every %0a%3c morning: some persons, however, instead of honey prefer %0a%3c using larch-resin for the purpose.

The blood, too, of a %0a%3c he-goat is prepared and taken with the food. For persons suf¬ %0a%3c fering from asthma, the most efficient remedy of all is the blood %0a%3c of wild horses 69 taken in drink ; and next to that, asses’ milk %0a%3c boiled with bulbs, the whey being the part used, with the %0a%3c addition of nasturtium steeped in water and tempered with %0a%3c honey, in the proportion of one cyathus of nasturtium to three %0a%3c semi-sextarii of whey.

The magicians, too, %0a%3c have added to this branch of medicine their own fanciful %0a%3c devices. In the first place of all, madness in he-goats, they %0a%3c say, may be effectually calmed by stroking the beard ; and if %0a%3c the beard is cut off, the goat will never stray to another flock. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 Asses’ milk is still recommended for pulmonary phthisis. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 See B. viii. c. 16. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliap. 57.] EEMEDIES FOE AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. 345 %0a%3c %0a%3c To the above composition they add goats’ dung, and recom¬ %0a%3c mend it to be held in the hollow of the hand, as hot as possible, %0a%3c a greased linen cloth being placed beneath, and care being %0a%3c taken to hold it in the right hand if the pain is on the left %0a%3c side, and in the left hand if the pain is on the right. They %0a%3c recommend also that the dung employed for this purpose should %0a%3c be taken up on the point of a needle made of copper. The %0a%3c mode of treatment is, for the patient to hold the mixture in %0a%3c his hand till the heat is felt to have penetrated to the loins, %0a%3c after which the hand is rubbed with a pounded leek, and the %0a%3c loins with the same dung annealed with honey. They prescribe %0a%3c also for the same malady the testes of a hare, to be eaten by the %0a%3c patient. In cases of sciatica they are for applying cow-dung %0a%3c warmed upon hot ashes in leaves : and for pains in the kidneys %0a%3c they recommend a hare’s kidneys to be swallowed raw, or %0a%3c perhaps boiled, but without letting them be touched by the %0a%3c teeth. If a person carries about him the pastern-bone of a %0a%3c hare, he will never be troubled with pains in the bowels, %0a%3c they say. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 57. -EEMEDIES FOE AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN. %0a%3c %0a%3c Affections of the spleen are alleviated by taking the gall of %0a%3c a wild boar or hog in drink ; ashes of burnt deer’s horns in %0a%3c vinegar ; or, what is best of all, the dried spleen of an ass, the %0a%3c good effects being sure to be felt in the course of three days. %0a%3c The first dung voided by an ass’s foal—a substance known as %0a%3c “ polea” 60 by the people of Syria—is administered in oxymel %0a%3c for these complaints; a dried horse tongue, too, is taken in %0a%3c wine, a sovereign remedy which, Caecilius Bion tells us, he first %0a%3c heard of when living among the barbarous nations. The milt %0a%3c of a cow or ox is used in a similar manner; but when it is %0a%3c quite fresh, the practice is to roast or boil it and take it with %0a%3c the food. For pains in the liver a topical application is made %0a%3c by bruising twenty heads of garlick in one sextarius of vinegar, %0a%3c and applying them in a piece of ox bladder. For the same %0a%3c malady the magicians recommend a calf’s milt, bought at the %0a%3c price set upon it and without any haggling, that berng an %0a%3c important point, and one that should be religiously observed. %0a%3c This done, the milt must be cut in two lengthwise, and attached %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 This would appear to be a Greek word in reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c .346 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the patient’s shirt, 61 on either side; after which, the patient %0a%3c must put it on and let the pieces full at his feet, and must %0a%3c then pick them up, and dry them in the shade.

The %0a%3c lights, too, of a fox are very useful for this purpose, dried on %0a%3c hot ashes and taken in water; the same, too, with a kid’s %0a%3c milt, applied to the part affected. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAT. 58. (14.)- REMEDIES FOR BOWEL COMPLAINTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c To arrest looseness of the bowels, deer’s blood is used ; the %0a%3c ashes also of deer’s horns ; the liver of a wild boar, taken fresh %0a%3c and without salt, in wine ; a swine’s liver roasted, or that of a %0a%3c he-goat, boiled in five semisextarii of wine ; a hare’s rennet %0a%3c boiled, in quantities the size of a chick-pea, in wine, or, if %0a%3c there are symptoms of fever, in water. To this last some %0a%3c persons add nut-galls, while others, again, content themselves %0a%3c with hare’s blood boiled by itself in milk. Ashes, too, of %0a%3c burnt horse-dung are taken in water for this purpose; or else %0a%3c ashes of the part of an old bull’s horn which lies nearest the %0a%3c root, sprinkled in water; the blood, too, of a he-goat boiled %0a%3c upon charcoal; or a decoction made from a goat’s hide boiled %0a%3c with the hair on. %0a%3c %0a%3c For relaxing the bowels a horse’s rennet is used, or else the %0a%3c blood, marrow, or liver of a she-goat. A similar effect is pro¬ %0a%3c duced by applying a wolf’s gall to the navel, with elaterium; 0 %0a%3c by taking mares’ milk, goats’ milk with salt and honey, or a %0a%3c she-goat’s gall with juice of cyclaminos, 63 and a little alum—in %0a%3c which last case some prefer adding nitre and water to the %0a%3c mixture. Bull’s gall, too, is used for a similar purpose, beaten %0a%3c up with wormwood and applied in the form of a suppository; or %0a%3c butter is taken, in considerable doses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Coeliac affections and dysentery are cured by taking cow’s %0a%3c liver; ashes of deer’s horns, a pinch in three fingers swallowed %0a%3c in water; hare’s rennet, kneaded up in bread, or, if there is %0a%3c any discharge of blood, taken with polenta ; M or else boar’s %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 “ Tunica.” 62 See B. xx. c. 2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 See B. xxv. c. 67.

Among the remedies, also, for the %0a%3c cceliac flux and dysentery, veal broth is reckoned, a remedy very %0a%3c commonly used. If the patient takes asses’ milk for these %0a%3c complaints, it will be all the better if honey is added; and no %0a%3c less efficacious for either complaint are the ashes of asses’ dung %0a%3c taken in wine ; or else polea, the substance above 65 -mentioned. %0a%3c In 6uch cases, even when attended with a discharge of blood, %0a%3c we find a horse’s rennet recommended, by some persons known %0a%3c as “hippace;” ashes of burnt horse-dung; horses’ teeth %0a%3c pounded; and boiled cows’ milk. In cases of dysentery, it is %0a%3c recommended to add a little honey ; and, for the cure of grip¬ %0a%3c ing pains, ashes of deer’s horns, bull’s gall mixed with cum¬ %0a%3c min, or the flesh of a gourd, should be applied to the navel. %0a%3c For both complaints new cheese made of cows’ milk is used, %0a%3c as an injection; butter also, in the proportion of four serni- %0a%3c sextarii to two ounces of turpentine, or else employed with a de¬ %0a%3c coction of mallows or with oil of roses. Veal-suet or beef-suet %0a%3c is also given, and the marrow of those animals is boiled with %0a%3c meal, a little wax, and some oil, so as to form a sort of pottage. %0a%3c This marrow, too, is kneaded up with bread for a similar pur¬ %0a%3c pose; or else goats’ milk is used, boiled down to one half. In %0a%3c cases, too, where there are gripings in the bowels, wine of the %0a%3c first running 60 is administered. For the last-named pains, some %0a%3c persons are of opinion that it is a sufficient remedy to take %0a%3c a single dose of hare’s rennet in mulled wine; though others %0a%3c again, who are more distrustful, are in the habit of applying a %0a%3c liniment to tbe abdomen, made of goats’ blood, barley-meal, %0a%3c and resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c For all defluxions of the bowels it is recommended to apply %0a%3c 6oft cheese, aud for cceliac affections and dysentery old cheese, %0a%3c powdered, one cyathus of cheese being taken in three cyathi of %0a%3c ordinary wine. Goats’ blood is boiled down with the marrow %0a%3c of those animals for the cure of dysentery ; and the cceliac flux %0a%3c is effectually treated with the roasted liver of a she-goat, or, %0a%3c what is still better, the liver of a he-goat boiled in astringent %0a%3c wine, and administered in the drink, or else applied to the navel %0a%3c with oil of myrtle.

(15.)- KEHEDIES FOB AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDEE, %0a%3c %0a%3c AND FOB UBINAEY CALCULI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Diseases of the bladder, and the torments attendant upon %0a%3c calculi, are treated with the urine of a wild boar, or the %0a%3c bladder of that animal taken as food; both of them being still %0a%3c more efficacious if they have been thoroughly soaked first. %0a%3c The bladder, when eaten, should be boiled first, and if the %0a%3c patient is a female, it should be a sow’s bladder. There are %0a%3c found in the liver of the wild boar certain small stones, 72 or %0a%3c what in hardness resemble small stones, of a white hue, and %0a%3c resembling those found in the liver of the common swine: if %0a%3c these stones are pounded and taken in wine, they will expel %0a%3c calculi, it is said. So oppressed is the wild boar by the bur¬ %0a%3c den of his urine, 73 that if he has not first voided it, he is %0a%3c unable to take to flight, and suffers himself to be taken as %0a%3c though he were enchained to the spot. This urine, they say, %0a%3c has a consuming effect upon urinary calculi. The kidneys of %0a%3c a hare, dried and taken in wine, act as an expellent upon %0a%3c calculi. We have already 74 mentioned that in the gammon of %0a%3c the hog there are certain joint-bones; a decoction made from %0a%3c them is remarkably useful for urinary affections. The kidneys %0a%3c of an ass, dried and pounded, and administered in undiluted %0a%3c iriue, are a cure for diseases of the bladder. The excrescences %0a%3c that grow on horses’ legs, taken for forty days in ordinary %0a%3c wine or honied wine, expel urinary calculi.

Running ulcers of those parts are %0a%3c treated with veal-suet and marrow, boiled in wine, or with the %0a%3c gall of a she-goat, mixed with honey and the extracted juice %0a%3c of the bramble. 76 In cases where these ulcers are serpiginous, %0a%3c it is recommended to use goats’ dung with honey or vinegar, %0a%3c or else butter by itself. Swellings of the testes are reduced by %0a%3c using veal-suet with nitre, or the dung of the animal boiled in %0a%3c vinegar. The bladder of a wild boar, eaten roasted, acts as a %0a%3c check upon incontinence of urine; a similar effect being pro¬ %0a%3c duced by the ashes of the feet of a wild boar or swine sprinkled %0a%3c in the drink; the ashes of a sow’s bladder taken in drink; the %0a%3c bladder or lights of a kid ; a hare’s brains taken in wine; the %0a%3c testes of a male hare grilled ; the rennet of that animal taken %0a%3c -with goose-grease and polenta ; 77 or the kidneys of an ass, beaten %0a%3c up and taken in undiluted wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magicians tell us, that after taking the ashes of a boar’s %0a%3c genitals in sweet wine, the patient must make -water in a dog %0a%3c kennel, and repeat the following formula—“ This I do that I %0a%3c may not wet my bed as a dog does.” On the other hand, a %0a%3c swine’s bladder, attached to the groin, facilitates the discharge %0a%3c of the urine, provided it has not already touched the ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 61. —REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS %0a%3c AND OF THE FUNDAMENT. %0a%3c %0a%3c For diseases of the fundament, a sovereign remedy is bear’s %0a%3c gall, mixed with the grease; to which some persons are in the %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 Ajasson remarks that arsenic should be used with the greatest care in %0a%3c such a case. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 “ Rubi.” lie probably means the bramble-berry. %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 See B. xviii. c. 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 61.] REMEDIES FOR THE GENERATIVE ORGANS. 351 %0a%3c %0a%3c kbit of adding litharge and frankincense.

Swellings of those parts are treated with veal %0a%3c suet—that from the loins in particular—mixed with rue. For %0a%3c other affections, goats’ blood is used, with polenta. Goats’ %0a%3c gall, too, is employed by itself, for the cure of condylomata, and %0a%3c sometimes, wolf’s gall, mixed with wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bears’ blood is curative of inflamed tumours and apost- %0a%3c emes upon these parts in general; as also bulls’ blood, dried %0a%3c and powdered. The best remedy, however, is considered to %0a%3c be the stone which the wild ass 78 voids with his urine, it is %0a%3c said, at the moment he is killed. This stone, which is in a %0a%3c somewhat liquefied state at first, becomes solid when it reaches %0a%3c the ground : attached to the thigh, it disperses all collections %0a%3c of humours and all kinds of suppurations: it is but rarely %0a%3c found, however, and it is not every wild ass that produces it, %0a%3c but as a remedy it is held in high esteem. Asses’ urine too, %0a%3c used in combination with gith, is highly recommended; the %0a%3c ashes of a horse’s hoof, applied with oil and water; a horse’s %0a%3c blood, that of a stone-horse in particular ; the blood, also, of an %0a%3c ox or cow, or the gall of those animals. Their flesh too, applied %0a%3c warm, is productive of similar results; the hoofs reduced to %0a%3c ashes, and taken in water or honey; the urine of a she-goat; %0a%3c the flesh of a he-goat, boiled in water; the dung of these %0a%3c animals, boiled with honey; or else a boar’s gall, or swine’s %0a%3c urine, applied in wool. %0a%3c %0a%3c Riding on horseback, we well know, galls and chafes the %0a%3c inside of the thighs: the best remedy for accidents of this %0a%3c nature is to rub the parts with the foam which collects at a %0a%3c horse’s mouth.

Cow- %0a%3c dung is also used, with lees of vinegar. Some persons speak %0a%3c highly in praise of the dung of a calf which has not begun to %0a%3c graze, or else a bull’s blood, without any other addition; a %0a%3c fox, also, boiled alive till only the bones are left; a wolf boiled %0a%3c alive in oil to the consistency of a cerate ; he-goat suet, with %0a%3c an equal proportion of helxine , 82 and one-third part of mus¬ %0a%3c tard ; or ashes of goats’ dung, mixed with axle-grease. They %0a%3c say, too, that for sciatica, it is an excellent plan to apply this %0a%3c dung boiling 83 hot beneath the great toes ; and that, for diseases %0a%3c of the joints, it is highly efficacious to attach bears’ gall or %0a%3c hares’ feet to the part affected. Gout, they say, may be allayed %0a%3c by the patient always carrying about with him a hare’s foot, %0a%3c cut off from the animal alive. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bears’ grease is a cure for chilblains and all kinds of chaps %0a%3c upon the feet; with the addition of alum, it is still more effi¬ %0a%3c cacious. The same results are produced by using goat-suet; %0a%3c a horse’s teeth powdered ; the gall of a wild boar or hog; or %0a%3c else the lights of those animals, applied with their grease; and %0a%3c this, too, where the soles are blistered, or the feet have been %0a%3c crushed by a substance striking against them.

For other kinds of ulcers butter is used, as a %0a%3c detergent, and as tending to make new flesh; ashes of deer’s %0a%3c antlers, or deer’s marrow ; or else bull’s gall, mixed with %0a%3c oil of Cyprus 2 or oil of iris. Wounds inflicted with edged %0a%3c weapons are .rubbed with fresh swine’s dung, or with dried %0a%3c swine’s dung, powdered. When ulcers are phagedaenic or %0a%3c fistulous, bull’s gall is injected, with leek-juice or woman’s %0a%3c milk; or else bull’s blood, dried and powdered, with the plant %0a%3c cotyledon. 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c Carcinomatous sores are treated with hare’s rennet, sprin¬ %0a%3c kled upon them with an equal proportion of capers in wine; %0a%3c gangrenes, with bears’ grease, applied with a feather; and %0a%3c ulcers of a serpiginous nature with the ashes of an ass’s hoofs, %0a%3c powdered upon them. The blood of the horse cqrrodes the %0a%3c ilesh by virtue of certain septic powers which it possesses; %0a%3c dried horse-dung, too, reduced to ashes, has a similar effect. %0a%3c Those kinds of ulcers which are commonly known as “phage¬ %0a%3c daenic,” are treated with the ashes of a cow’s hide, mixed with %0a%3c honey.

Butter, too, is very %0a%3c good ; as also in the case of beasts of burden, if applied with %0a%3c warmed resin : bull glue is also used, melted in vinegar, aud %0a%3c incorporated with lime; or goat’s gall, mixed -with calcined %0a%3c alum. The eruption called “ boa,” 4 is treated with cow-dung, %0a%3c a fact to which it is indebted for its name.

It is a good plan, too, to use fumigations %0a%3c for the uterus, made with deer’s hair, burnt. Hinds, they say, %0a%3c when they find themselves pregnant, are in the habit of swal¬ %0a%3c lowing a small stone. This stone, when found in their excre-'^ %0a%3c inents, or in the uterus—for it is to be found there as well— %0a%3c attached to the body as an amulet, is a preventive of abortion. %0a%3c There are also certain small stones, found in the heart and uterus %0a%3c of these animals, which are very useful for women during preg¬ %0a%3c nancy and in travail. As to the kind of pumice-stone which %0a%3c is similarly found in thg uterus of the cow, we have already 7 %0a%3c mentioned it when treating of the formation of that animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c A wolf’s fat, applied externally, acts emolliently upon the %0a%3c uterus, and the liver of a wolf is very soothing for pains in %0a%3c that organ. It is found advantageous for women, w r hen near %0a%3c delivery, to eat wolf’s flesh, or, if they are in travail, to have %0a%3c a person near them who has eaten it; so much so, indeed, that %0a%3c it will act as a countercharm even to any noxious spells which %0a%3c may have been laid upon them. In case, however, a person %0a%3c who has eaten wolf’s flesh should happen to enter the room %0a%3c at the moment of parturition, dangerous effects will be sure to %0a%3c follow. The hare, too, is remarkably useful for the complaints %0a%3c of females: the lights of that animal, dried and taken in drink, %0a%3c are beneficial to the uterus; the liver, taken in waterwith Samian ' %0a%3c earth, acts as an emmenagogue; and the rennet brings away %0a%3c the after-birth, due care being taken by the patient not to bathe %0a%3c the day before. Applied in wool as a pessary, with saffron and %0a%3c leek-juice, this last acts as an expellent upon the dead foetus. It %0a%3c is a general opinion that the uterus of a hare, taken with the %0a%3c food, promotes the conception of male offspring, and that a %0a%3c similar effect is produced by using the testes and rennet of that %0a%3c animal. It is thought, too, that a leveret, taken from the uterus %0a%3c of its dam, is a restorative of fruitfulness to women who are %0a%3c otherwise past child-bearing. Eut it is the blood of a hare’s %0a%3c foetus that the magicians recommend males to drink: while for %0a%3c young girls they prescribe nine pellets of hare’s dung, to ensure p %0a%3c a durable firmness to the breasts. For a similar purpose, also, %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 In 13. xi. c. 79. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s NATUItAL 1IIST0HT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c they apply hare’s rennet with honey; and to prevent hairs %0a%3c from growing again when once removed, they use a liniment %0a%3c of hare’s blood. %0a%3c %0a%3c For inflations of the uterus, it is found a good plan to apply %0a%3c ~ wild boars’ dung or swine’s dung topically with oil: but a %0a%3c ~ still more effectual remedy is to dry the dung, and sprinkle it, %0a%3c powdered, in the patient’s drink, even though she should be %0a%3c in a state of pregnancy or suffering the pains of child-birth. %0a%3c By administering sow’s milk with honied wine, parturition is %0a%3c facilitated ; and if taken by itself it will promote the secre¬ %0a%3c tion of the milk when deficient in nursing women. By rub¬ %0a%3c bing the breasts of famales with sow’s blood they are pre¬ %0a%3c vented from becoming too large. If pains are felt in the %0a%3c breasts, they will be alleviated by drinking asses’ milk; and the %0a%3c same milk, taken with honey, has considerable efficacy as an %0a%3c — emmenagogue. Stale fat, too, from the same animal, heals %0a%3c ulcerations of the uterus : applied as a pessary, in wool, it acts %0a%3c emolliently upon indurations of that organ ; and, applied fresh %0a%3c ^ by itself, or in water when stale, it has all the virtues of a %0a%3c depilatory. %0a%3c %0a%3c An ass’s milt, dried and applied in water to the breasts, %0a%3c promotes the secretion of the milk; and used in the form of a %0a%3c fumigation, it acts as a corrective upon the uterus. A fumi¬ %0a%3c gation made with a burnt ass’s hoof, placed beneath a woman, %0a%3c accelerates parturition, so much so, indeed, as to expel the dead %0a%3c foetus even : hence it is that it should only be employed in cases %0a%3c of miscarriage, it having a fatal effect upon the living foetus. %0a%3c %0a%3c • Asses’ dung, applied fresh, has a wonderful effect, they say, in %0a%3c arresting discharges of blood in females : the same, too, with %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ the ashes of this dung, which, used as a pessary, are very good %0a%3c for the uterus. If the skin is rubbed with the foam from a %0a%3c horse’s mouth for forty days together, before the first hair has %0a%3c made its appearance, it will effectually prevent the growth %0a%3c thereof: a decoction, too, made from deer’s antlers is productive %0a%3c of a similar effect, being all the better if they are used quite %0a%3c fresh. Mares’ milk, used as an injection, is highly beneficial %0a%3c to the uterus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Where the foetus is felt to be dead in the uterus, the %0a%3c lichens or excrescences from a horse’s legs, taken in fresh %0a%3c water, will act as an expellent: an effect produced also by a %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ fumigation made with the hoofs or dry dung of that animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 77.] KEMEDIES FOE FEMALE DISEASES. 36'3 %0a%3c %0a%3c Procidence of the uterus is arrested by using butter, in the %0a%3c form of an injection ; and indurations of that organ are removed %0a%3c by similarly employing ox-gall, with oil of roses, turpentine %0a%3c being applied externally in wool. They say, too, that a fumi¬ %0a%3c gation, made from ox-dung, acts as a corrective upon procidence %0a%3c of the uterus, and facilitates parturition; and that conception %0a%3c is promoted by the use of cows’ milk. It is a well-known %0a%3c fact that sterility is often entailed by suffering in child-birth ; %0a%3c an evil which may be averted, Olympias of Thebes assures us, %0a%3c by rubbing the parts, before sexual intercourse, with bull’s %0a%3c gall, serpents’ fat, verdigrease, and honey. In cases, too, where %0a%3c menstruation is too abundant, the external parts should be %0a%3c sprinkled with a solution of calf’s gall, the moment before the %0a%3c sexual congress; a method which acts emolliently also upon %0a%3c indurations of the abdomen. Applied to the navel as a lini¬ %0a%3c ment, it arrests excessive discharges, and is generally beneficial %0a%3c to the uterus. The proportions generally adopted are—-one %0a%3c denarius of gall, one-third of a denarius of opium, and as much %0a%3c oil of almonds as may appear to be requisite; the whole being %0a%3c applied in sheep’s wool. The gall, too, of a bull-calf is beaten %0a%3c up with half the quantity of honey, and kept in readiness for %0a%3c the treatment of uterine diseases. If a woman about the time %0a%3c of conception eats roasted veal with the plant aristolochia, 8 she %0a%3c will bring forth a male child, we are assured. Calf’s marrow, %0a%3c boiled in wine and water with the suet, and applied as a pes¬ %0a%3c sary, is good for ulcerations of the uterus ; the same, too, with %0a%3c foxes’ fat and cats’ dung, the last being applied with resin and %0a%3c oil of roses. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is considered a remarkably good plan to subject the uterus %0a%3c to fumigations made with burnt goats’horns. The blood of %0a%3c the wild goat, mixed with sea-palm, 9 acts as a depilatory. The %0a%3c gall of the other kinds of goat, used as an injection, acts %0a%3c emolliently upon callosities of the uterus, and ensures concep¬ %0a%3c tion immediately after menstruation: it possesses also the %0a%3c virtues of a depilatory, the application being left for three days %0a%3c upon the flesh after the hair has been removed. The midwives %0a%3c assure us that she-goats’ urine, taken in drink, and the dung, %0a%3c applied topically, will arrest uterine discharges, however %0a%3c much in excess. The membrane in which the kid is en¬ %0a%3c closed in the uterus, dried and taken in wine, acts as an expei- %0a%3c 8 See 13. xxv. cc. 79, 84, 91. 9 See B. xiii. c. 49. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 364 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXVIII, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lent upon the after-birth.

According to Osthanes, %0a%3c if a woman’s loins are rubbed with blood taken from the ticks %0a%3c upon a black wild bull, she will be inspired with an aversion to %0a%3c sexual intercourse : she will forget, too, her former love, by %0a%3c taking a lie-goat’s urine in drink, some nard being mixed with %0a%3c it to disguise the loathsome taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 78. -REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c For infants there is nothing more useful than butter, 10 cither %0a%3c by itself or in combination with honey; for dentition more %0a%3c particularly, for soreness of the gums, and for ulcerations of %0a%3c the mouth. A wolf’s tooth, attached to the body, prevents %0a%3c infants from being startled, and acts as a preservative against %0a%3c the maladies attendant upon dentition; an effect equally %0a%3c produced by making use of a wolf’s skin. The larger teeth, %0a%3c also, of a wolf, attached to a horse’s neck, will render him %0a%3c proof against all weariness, it is said. A hare’s rennet, applied %0a%3c to the breasts of the nurse, effectually prevents diarrhoea in %0a%3c the infant suckled by her. An ass’s liver, mixed with a little %0a%3c panax, and dropped into the mouth of an infant, will preserve %0a%3c it from epilepsy and other diseases to which infants are liable; %0a%3c this, however, must be done for forty days, they say. An ass’s %0a%3c skin, too, thrown over infants, renders them insensible to fear. %0a%3c The first teeth shed by a horse, attached as an amulet to infants, %0a%3c facilitate dentition, and are better still, when not allowed to %0a%3c touch the ground. For pains in the spleen, an ox’s milt is ad¬ %0a%3c ministered in honey, and applied topically'; and for running %0a%3c ulcers it is used as an application, with honey. A calf’s milt, %0a%3c boiled in wine, is beaten up, and applied to incipient ulcers %0a%3c of the mouth. %0a%3c %0a%3c The magicians take the brains of a she-goat, and, after passing %0a%3c them through a gold ring, drop them into the mouth of the in¬ %0a%3c fant before it takes the breast, as a preservative against epilepsy %0a%3c and other infantile diseases. Goats’ dung, attached to in¬ %0a%3c fants in a piece of cloth, prevents them from being rest¬ %0a%3c less, female infants in particular. By rubbing the gums of %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 There is probably some truth in these statements as to the utility of %0a%3c butter and honey for infants. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 80.] STIMULANTS FOR THE SEXUAL PASSIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 365 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c infants with goats’ milk or hare’s brains, dentition is greatly %0a%3c facilitated. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CIIAI*. 79.-PROVOCATIVES OF SLEEP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato was of opinion that hare’s flesh, 11 taken as a diet, is %0a%3c provocative of sleep. It is a vulgar notion, too, that this diet %0a%3c confers beauty for nine days on those who use it; a silly play 13 %0a%3c upon words, no doubt, but a notion which has gained far too %0a%3c extensively not to have had some real foundation. According %0a%3c to the magicians, the gall of a she-goat, but only of one that %0a%3c has been sacrificed, applied to the eyes or placed beneath the %0a%3c pillow, has a narcotic effect. Too profuse perspiration is %0a%3c checked by rubbipg the body with ashes of burnt goats’ horns %0a%3c mixed with oil of myrtle. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 80.—STIMULANTS FOR THE SEXUAL PASSIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the aphrodisiacs, we find mentioned, a wild boar’s %0a%3c gall, applied externally; swine’s marrow, taken inwardly; %0a%3c asses’ fat, mixed with the grease of a gander and applied as a %0a%3c liniment; the virulent substance described by Virgil 13 as dis¬ %0a%3c tilling from mares when oovered; and the dried testes of a %0a%3c horse, pulverized and mixed with the drink. The right testicle, %0a%3c also, of an ass, is taken in a proportionate quantity of wine, or worn %0a%3c attached to the arm in a bracelet; or else the froth discharged %0a%3c by that animal after covering, collected in a piece of red cloth %0a%3c and enclosed in silver, as Osthanes informs us. Salpe recom¬ %0a%3c mends the genitals of this animal to be plunged seven times in %0a%3c boiling oil, and the corresponding parts to be well rubbed %0a%3c therewith. Eialcon 14 says that these genitals should be reduced %0a%3c to ashes and taken in drink ; or else the urine that has been %0a%3c voided by a bull immediately after covering: he recommends, %0a%3c also, that the groin should be well rubbed with earth moistened %0a%3c with this urine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 Ajasson explains this by saying that the hare being eaten by the people %0a%3c of ancient Latium on festival days, with plenteous potations, they erro¬ %0a%3c neously supposed the narcotic effects of the wine to be produced by the %0a%3c flesh of the hare. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 The resemblance of “ lepos,” “grace,” to “ lepus,” “ a hare.” Seo %0a%3c Martial, B. v.

The lights of a wild boar or %0a%3c swine, roasted, are an effectual preservative against drunken¬ %0a%3c ness ; they must, however, be eaten fasting, and upon the %0a%3c same day. The lights of a kid, too, are productive of the %0a%3c 6am e effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 81. (20.)- REMARKABLE FACTS RELATIVE TO ANIMALS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to those already mentioned, there are various %0a%3c other marvellous facts related, with reference to these animals. %0a%3c When a horse-shoe becomes detached from the hoof, as often %0a%3c is the case, if a person takes it up and puts it by, it will act as %0a%3c a remedy for hiccup the moment he calls to mind the spot %0a%3c where he has placed it. A wolf’s liver, they say, is similar to %0a%3c a horse’s hoof in appearance ; and a horse, they tell us, if %0a%3c it follows in the track of a wolf, will burst 15 asunder beneath %0a%3c its rider.. The pastern-bones of swine have a certain tendency %0a%3c to promote discord, it is said. In cases of fire, if some of the %0a%3c dung can be brought away from the stalls, both sheep and %0a%3c oxen may be got out all the more easilyq and will make no at¬ %0a%3c tempt to retuni. The flesh of a lie-goat will lose its rank %0a%3c smell, if the animal has eaten barley-bread, or drunk an in¬ %0a%3c fusion of laser 16 the day on which it was killed. Meat that %0a%3c has been salted while the moon was on the wane, will never %0a%3c be attacked by worms. In fact, so great has been the care %0a%3c taken to omit no possible researches, that a deaf hare, we find, %0a%3c will grow fat 17 sooner than one that can hear! %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the remedies for the diseases of animals—If a beast of %0a%3c burden voids blood, an injection must be used of swine’s dung %0a%3c mixed with wine. For the maladies of oxen, a mixture of suet %0a%3c 1 $ used with quicksilver, and wild garlic boiled ; the whole %0a%3c beaten up and administered in wine. The fat, too, of a fox %0a%3c is employed. The liquor of boiled horse-flesh, administered in %0a%3c their drink, is recommended for the cure of diseased swine: %0a%3c and, indeed, the maladies of all four-footed beasts may be effec- %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 He has already stated, in c. 44, that a horse will become torpid if it %0a%3c follows in the track of a wolf; for which statement, according to Ajasson, %0a%3c there appears to be some foundation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1S See B. xix. c. 15. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 This is not unlikely; for it has no alarms to make it grow thin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 81.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SUMMARY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 367 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tually treated by boiling a she-goat whole, in her skin, along %0a%3c -with a bramble-frog. Poultry, they say, will never be touched %0a%3c by a fox, if they have eaten the dried liver of that animal, or %0a%3c if the cock, when treading the hen, has had a piece of fox’s %0a%3c skin about his neck. The same property, too, is attributed to %0a%3c a weazel’s gall. The oxen in the Isle of Cyprus cure them¬ %0a%3c selves of gripings in the abdomen, it is said, by swallowing 18 %0a%3c human excrements : the feet, too, of oxen will never be worn %0a%3c to the quick, if their hoofs are well rubbed with tar before %0a%3c they begin work. Wolves will never approach a field, if, after %0a%3c one has been caught and its legs broken and throat cut, the %0a%3c blood is dropped little by little along the boundaries of the %0a%3c field, and the body buried on the spot from which it was %0a%3c first dragged. The share, too, with which the first furrow %0a%3c in the field has been traced in the current year, should be taken %0a%3c from the plough, and placed upon the hearth of the Lares, %0a%3c where the family is in the habit of meeting, and left there till %0a%3c it is consumed : so long as this is in doing, uo wolf will attack %0a%3c any animal in the field. %0a%3c %0a%3c We will now turn to an examination of those animals which, %0a%3c being neither tame nor wild, are of a nature peculiar to them¬ %0a%3c selves. %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, one %0a%3c thousand six hundred and eighty-two. %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman authors quoted. —M.Varro, 19 L.Piso, 20 Fabian us, 21 Va¬ %0a%3c lerius Antias, 22 Verrius Flaccus, 23 Cato the Censor, 24 Servius Sul- %0a%3c picius, 25 Licinius Macer, 26 Celsus, 27 Massurius, 28 Sextius Niger 29 %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 See B. viii. c. 41, as to a similar practice on the part of the panther. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 See end of B. ii. 211 See end of B. ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 For Fabianus Papirius, see end of B. ii.

Nothing further is known of him. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 Aurelius Opilius, the freedman of an Epicurean. He taught philosophy, %0a%3c rhetoric, and grammar at Rome, but finally withdrew to Smyrna. One of %0a%3c his works, mentioned by A. Gellius, was entitled “ Musoe,” and the name %0a%3c of another was “ Pinax.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 From the mention made of his profound speculations in Chap. 9, %0a%3c %0a%3c Fabricius has reckoned him among the medical writers of Rome. It has %0a%3c also been suggested that he may have been the Granius Flaccus mentioned %0a%3c by Censorinus as the author of the “ Indigitamenta,” or Register of the %0a%3c Pontiffs. 33 See end of B. ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 Probably Apollonius Mus, or Myronides, a physician who flourished %0a%3c in the first century B.c., who is mostly identified with Apollonius Hero- %0a%3c phileius. His “ Myrosis ” here mentioned is probably the work “ On %0a%3c Unguents ” mentioned by Athenaeus, B. xv. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Nothing whatever is known of him. It has been suggested that the %0a%3c name may have been “ Melitus.” A contemporary of Socrates, an orator %0a%3c and tragic writer, was so named. %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Beyond the mention of him in c. 2 of this Book, nothing is known %0a%3c relative to this medical writer : no great loss, perhaps, if we may judge from %0a%3c the extract there given. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Though mentioned among the foreign writers, the name is evidently %0a%3c Roman. Nothing relative to him is known. %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 See end of B. xii. 33 See end of B. iii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 Probably the writer mentioned at the end of B. viii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 See end of B. viii. 42 See end of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 See end of B. xx. The “ Idiophya” was probably a work “ On the %0a%3c Peculiar Animals,” which passed as the composition of the mythic Orpheus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 A Greek poet, said to have been born at Chersonesus, a town in Egypt. %0a%3c Some of his Epigrams are still extant in the Anthology, and it has been %0a%3c suggested that he flourished either in the time of Ptolemy Soter, of Ptolemy %0a%3c Euergetes II., or of Ptolemy Philadelphus. His work “ On Peculiar %0a%3c Animals,” here mentioned, was probably written in verse. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 See end of B. viii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 A female writer on medical subjects. In addition to.her work men¬ %0a%3c tioned in Chap. 23 of this Book, Labbe speaks of a work of hers in MS. %0a%3c “ On Menstruation,” preserved in the Library at Florence. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 The female who is mentioned in Chap. 23 of this Book as having %0a%3c written on Abortion, or the Diseases peculiar to Females, was probably a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8TJMMAEY, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 369 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c phantis, 48 Salpe, 40 Olympias 50 of Thebes, Diotimus 51 of Thebes, %0a%3c Iollas, 42 Andreas, 53 Marcion 54 of Smyrna, .iEschines 55 the %0a%3c physician, Hippocrates, 56 Aristotle, 57 Metrodorus 58 of Scepsos, %0a%3c Icetidas” the physician, Apelles 60 the physician, Hesiod, 81 %0a%3c Dalion, 62 Caecilius, 63 Bion 64 who wrote “On Powers,” 64 * Anaxi- %0a%3c laus, 65 King Juba. 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c different person from either of the two famous courtesans of that name. %0a%3c Nothing whatever is known of her. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 The writer of certain amatory poems, much admired by the Emperor %0a%3c Tiberius, generally supposed, from the grammatical form of the name, to %0a%3c have been a female. Galen quotes a work “ On Cosmetics,” as written by %0a%3c a person of this name. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 A native of Lemnos, who wrote on the Diseases of Women.
