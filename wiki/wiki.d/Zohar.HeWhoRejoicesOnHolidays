text=He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%0a%0a%0a174. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "He who rejoices on holidays and does %0anot give a part to the Creator, the evil eye hates and slanders him, removes %0ahim from this world, and brings him many miseries." %0a%0aWe have already said (item 68) that the impure forces (egoistic spiritual %0aforces within man that know of and hence desire the pleasures hidden in the %0aCreator's Light) consist of male and female parts. The male part brings less harm %0athan the female. It leads man to transgressions such as lying in the name of the %0aCreator, as though it inspires man to observe the Mitzvot, but not in complete %0apurity (with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator). Instead, it causes man %0ato also add a touch of personal benefit and selfish enjoyment, as it is written: %0a"Eat not the bread of an ill-willer, nor desire his treats; for as one reckons within %0ahimself, such is he: 'Eat and drink,' he shall say to you; but his heart is not with %0ayou" (Mishley, 23:6-7). %0a%0aSince the male impure force has absolutely no intentions to bestow, the %0acommandment remains devoid of fear and love (without a heart). Yet, since the %0amale impure force has already caught man in its net, it gains power to make a %0aZivug with its female half (the impure Nukva), which is a bitter and evil impure %0aforce that lies in the name of the Creator, and, upon seducing man, captures %0ahis entire soul. %0a%0aHence, The Zohar says that the evil eye hates and slanders man, and removes %0ahim from this world by provoking him to fail to observe the commandment of %0arejoicing on a holiday (the reception of Ohr Hochma, joy on a higher degree)— so %0athat this joy would not be for the sake of the Creator. It is as though he eats %0aalone and does not share his food with the needy, which leads to the male %0aimpure force making a Zivug with Nukva and capturing man's soul. %0a%0a355 %0a%0a%0a%0a356 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a175. The Creator's role is to cheer the poor, according to His ability. For the %0aCreator appears on the holidays so as to look at His broken Kelim. He comes %0ato them, and He sees that there is nothing to rejoice in, and He weeps for %0athem, and ascends Above to destroy the world. %0a%0aTo understand this passage and the angels' objections, one must first %0aunderstand the words of the sages (Midrash Raba, 86): "When creating the world, %0athe Creator asked the angels: 'Shall we create man in our image (T^elem) and %0alikeness?' And the four angels (forces, properties) of creation gave their answers: %0a%0aMercy said, LET US CREATE, for he creates Hassadim, mercy. Truth %0asaid, LET US NOT CREATE, for he is all falsehood. Justice said, LET US %0aCREATE, for he dispenses justice. Peace said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he %0ais all enmity." %0a%0aWhat did the Creator do? He took truth and concealed it in the ground, as %0ait is written: "cast down truth to the ground" (Daniel, 8: 12). Our entire purpose %0ain the study of the Torah and Mitzvot lies in that, thanks to them, as the Talmud %0asays (Psachim, 50, 2): "From Lo Lishma (intentions for oneself) man comes to %0aLishma (intentions for the Creator's sake)." %0a%0aAnd since man is born with such insignificant desires and powers, he is %0aunable to immediately engage in the Creator's Mitzvot for the sake of pleasing %0athe Giver of these Mitzvot, for as it is said: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" (lyov, %0a11:12). Due to his egoistic nature, he is unable to make any inner movement or %0aaction if it is not for his own benefit. %0a%0aTherefore, the Creator allows man to begin observing the Mitzvot solely for %0ahis own sake, seeking personal benefit. Yet, in spite of this, his actions attract %0aspiritual Light to him. And then, with the help of the received Light, he comes %0ato observe the Mitzvot for the Creator's sake, in order to please Him. %0a%0aThis is exactly what Truth presented when it objected to man's creation %0aand said that he is all falsehood. After all, how can man be created to study the %0aTorah and observe Mitzvot in a state of absolute falsehood, i.e., "for oneself?" %0a%0aHowever, Mercy said, "Let us create," for man performs merciful deeds. %0aAlthough the Mitzvot of mercy, which man observes (even if mechanically) initially %0a"for his own sake," are mere external actions without the intention of bestowal, %0awith their help he gradually corrects his intentions until he becomes capable of %0aobserving all the Mitzvot "for the Creator's sake." Hence, there exists an absolute %0acertainty and guarantee that through his efforts, man will achieve the goal- %0aaltruistic actions "for the Creator's sake." And that it is okay to create man. %0a%0a%0a%0aHe Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%0a%0a%0a357 %0a%0a%0a%0aPeace also asserted that man is all "enmity;" hence, he can observe the Mitzvot %0a"for the Creator's sake" only if it also brings him personal benefit. However, due %0ato such mixed intentions and actions, man exists in constant conflict with the %0aCreator, for it seems to him that he is great and righteous, and he utterly fails to %0asee his shortcomings. In other words, he is completely unaware that all his work %0ain the Torah and Mitzvot is exclusively for his own benefit. %0a%0aAnd because he feels this way, he fills up with anger and resentment towards %0athe Creator: why does the Creator not treat him as it befits one so perfectly %0arighteous? It follows that he alternates between states of peace and conflict with %0athe Creator. That is why Peace objected to the creation of man. %0a%0aHowever, Justice said that man should be created, for he dispenses justice. %0aBy observing the Mitzva (singular for Mitzvot) of giving charity to the poor, even %0awith the intention "for oneself," he gradually acquires the property of "bestowal," %0alearns to act "for the Creator's sake," and merits eternal peace with Him. %0a%0aAfter the Creator heard these opinions, He agreed with the angels of %0aMercy and Justice, and cast down Truth to the "ground." By this, He allowed %0aman to begin observing the Mitzvot with the intention "for oneself," despite %0aits falsehood. %0a%0aIt follows that the Creator cast Truth down to the ground because He had %0aaccepted the claims of Mercy and Justice, that thanks to the Mitzva of giving %0acharity to the poor, man will ultimately come to Truth, i.e., work for the Creator's %0asake, and Truth will rise from the ground. %0a%0aThe only creation created by the Creator is Malchut de Malchut, egoism, %0aand it can only be corrected by "instilling" the Creator's properties of Bina %0aor mercy into it. Yet, if these properties are opposite, how can such a thing be %0aaccomplished? After all, in the spiritual world, distance is proportionate to the %0adifference in properties. So how can Malchut be united with Bina? %0a%0aTo this end, the Kli was broken: the spiritual, altruistic desire lost its screen %0aand became egoistic. Yet, it retained sparks of the Light, and these sparks exist %0awithin egoistic desires. This is why egoistic desires have power over us. %0a%0aThese sparks of the Upper Light are the source of various pleasures and love, %0afor Light is pleasure. And since these particles of Light are clothed in impure %0agarments and exist under the rule of the impure forces, man starts perceiving %0athese feelings of love and delight as being inherent in the impure forces, as %0athough these egoistic garments contain pleasures, and such is their property. %0aAnd he associates the properties of love and pleasure with the impure forces, %0a%0a%0a%0a358 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0afailing to understand that the impure forces draw him solely with the spiritual %0aspark that has fallen into them. %0a%0aHowever, as the impure force is very appealing, it lures man into all kinds %0aof transgressions, such as theft, robbery, and murder. At the same time, it gives %0aus the desire to observe the Torah and Mitzvot for our own sake. Even if we start %0aobserving them not "for the Creator's sake," but "for ourselves," (for our own %0abenefit, to fulfill our base aspirations, according to the desires of the broken, %0aegoistic JCelim-vessels), we gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's %0asake," and merit the goal of creation— to receive all the pleasure that was prepared %0afor us back in the Thought of Creation— "to delight man." Thus, the impure %0aforces destroy themselves, but that is exactly the purpose for which the Creator %0aconceived and created them. %0a%0aThe Zohar says that the Creator appears on these holidays to look at all the %0abroken Kelim. On holidays, when man observes the Mitzva of rejoicing because %0aof the great Light that he receives from the Creator, the Creator appears to look %0aat His broken vessels, by which man is given an opportunity to observe the %0aMitzvot not "for the Creator's sake." The Creator comes and looks at how well %0athese broken vessels have fulfilled their mission to bring man to observance of %0athe Mitzvot with the intention "for the Creator's sake." %0a%0aHowever, the Creator comes to them and sees that there is nothing to rejoice %0ain. He weeps over them, for He sees that nothing spiritual (altruistic) was created %0afrom the broken vessels, that man has yet to correct even a single broken vessel %0a(egoistic desire). In other words, there's not one vessel that was intentionally %0abroken by the Creator that has brought man to the intention "for the Creator's %0asake," and he rejoices on holidays solely for his own pleasure. %0a%0aSo the Creator weeps and regrets breaking the vessels, for He broke them %0aand cast Truth to the ground only for man's sake, to give him an opportunity to %0astart working in falsehood (in the intention "for oneself) and gradually come %0ato Truth, to the intention "for the Creator's sake." Yet, when He sees that man %0ahas not changed at all in his aspirations for selfish pleasure, it is as though the %0avessels were broken in vain, and so He weeps for them. %0a%0aAnd He rises Above, to destroy the world— meaning, He ascends so as to stop %0athe Light's descent and thereby destroy the world. The world and creatures can %0aexist only if they receive the Creator's Light (even if unconsciously). However, %0aif man's state and selfish actions cannot lead him to the intention "for the %0aCreator's sake," the Light itself becomes detrimental to him, for in pursuit of this %0aLight, man sinks ever deeper into egoistic desires (impure forces) and growing %0a%0a%0a%0aHe Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%0a%0a%0a359 %0a%0a%0a%0adependency on egoism. Therefore, it is more desirable and beneficial for man %0ato stop feeling pleasure in his impure desires, so that it would not destroy him %0acompletely and prevent him from sinking into such powerful egoistic desires %0athat, having become a slave to their pleasures, he would never be able escape %0athem and attain the spiritual. %0a%0a176. The members of the assembly then appear before the Creator and say: %0a"Master of the world, You are called merciful and forgiving, send Your mercy %0aupon Your sons." He answers them: "Have I not done so, when I created the %0aworld based on mercy? As it is written, 'The world is built by mercy' and the %0aworld is established upon it. However, if they do not show mercy to the poor, %0athe world will be destroyed." The Heavenly angels then say to Him: "Master %0aof the world, here is a man who had eaten and drunk to his heart's content, %0aand could have been merciful to the poor, but did not do anything." The %0aprosecutor appears, receives permission, and persecutes that man. %0a%0aThe exalted souls, called "the members (or the sons) of the assembly" begin %0apraying for the lower ones, so the Creator would have mercy on His sons and %0anot discontinue the flow of Light descending onto them. They do everything %0awithin their power to justify man's state of being, and say that as long as he %0aobserves his Mitzvot in faith, he is called "the Creator's son," and hence deserves %0athe Creator's mercy, as a son deserves the mercy of his father. %0a%0aThe Creator replies to them that He created the world by the property of %0amercy, and the world stands on this property alone. In other words, man will %0anot be corrected by the Creator's Light as long as he disdains the poor, for the %0aworld's creation was the result of the Creator's agreement with the angel of %0aMercy, which states that due to man's merciful deeds, the world will be able to %0aexist and will gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's sake." But now, %0asince people are not showing mercy, there will be no correction. %0a%0aThen the Supernal angels said, "Master of the universe, here is a man who %0ahad eaten and drunk, and had his fill, and could have been merciful to the poor, %0abut did not give them anything." In this case, the angels begin to accuse man, %0ainstead of defending him, even the angels of Mercy and Justice. And all those %0awho did not wish to create an egoistic man with desires "for oneself," but agreed %0ato it only because they assumed that by deeds of mercy and justice he would %0aescape his egoism "for one's own sake" and achieve the altruistic property "for %0athe Creator's sake." Now, they, too, turn against man. %0a%0aAnd if man is unable to acquire the intention "for the Creator's sake," the %0aangels repent and regret at having agreed to his creation, and they now accuse %0a%0a%0a%0a360 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ahim before the Creator. And after it becomes clear that man will not achieve the %0aaltruistic property "for the Creator's sake" by observing the Mitzvot, he is passed %0ainto the hands of the prosecutor. %0a%0a177. There are none greater in our world than Avraham, who acted with mercy %0atoward all creatures. It is written of the day that he prepared a feast: "The child %0agrew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak %0awas weaned." So Avraham prepared a feast and invited all the leaders of that %0ageneration. It is well known that at every feast, the supreme prosecutor is about, %0awatching. And if there are any poor people in the house, he leaves that house %0aand does not return there. However, if the prosecutor enters a house and sees %0arejoicing without the poor— without having first shown mercy to the poor— he %0aascends Above and brings accusations against the host of that feast. %0a%0a178. Because Avraham was the leader of his generation, the prosecutor %0adescended from Heavens and stood at the door of his house, disguised as a %0apoor man. And nobody so much as looked at him. Avraham was attending %0ato kings and ministers, and Sarah was feeding all of their children, for they %0adid not believe that she had born a child, but rather claimed that Yitzchak %0awas a foundling, whom they had bought at the marketplace. This is why they %0abrought their children with them, and Sarah nursed them in front of all. And %0athe prosecutor stands at the door. Sarah said: "The Creator has made laughter %0afor me" ("For anyone who hears will laugh on account of me" (Beresheet, %0a21:6). The prosecutor ascended at once and stood before the Creator, and said %0ato Him, "O Master of the world, You have said that You love Avraham, and %0ahere he had prepared a feast, but had not given anything to You nor to the %0apoor, had not sacrificed even a single pigeon for Your sake. And Sarah says %0athat You have laughed at her." %0a%0aUntil the end of correction, it is impossible to fully rid oneself of the impure %0aforces. Hence, however hard even the most exalted righteous may try to observe %0athe Creator's Mitzvot in purity of their altruistic intentions, without any touch %0aof personal benefit, the impure forces can nonetheless accuse them and find %0afaults in their observance of the Mitzvot. %0a%0aTherefore, the Creator prepared another opportunity for the righteous to %0asilence the prosecutor— by bribing him with a certain portion of holiness and %0apurity, thus silencing him. This way, the prosecutor is reluctant to accuse a %0arighteous one and does not want him to disappear, for then the prosecutor, %0atoo, will be deprived of his part of holiness, the Light that he receives as the %0arighteous one observes each Mitzvot. %0a%0a%0a%0aHe Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%0a%0a%0a361 %0a%0a%0a%0aHence, the need for external hair in Tefillin (phylacteries), scapegoat rite, red %0aheifer, and so forth. (The Zohar, Emor, p. 88). From this we see how extraordinary, %0amultifaceted, and complex this world is created, how impossible it is to judge %0ahuman deeds and the Upper Governance by external manifestations, as they are %0aseen by us, and how "entangled" and inseparably intertwined all the connections %0abetween the pure and impure forces really are. %0a%0aEven when we look at our great leaders-Kabbalists, we see how much they've %0asuffered, how they were forced to submit to the will of petty rulers or ignorant %0amasses, and how persecuted they were— those who were closest to the Creator! %0aEveryone feels these obstacles, even those who are just beginning on their %0aspiritual journey. %0a%0aBut here, in the example of Avraham, The Zohar does not speak about an %0aordinary prosecutor, for Avraham had surely given food to all the poor, as he %0ahad always done even before he invited his distinguished guests to his table. But %0athis prosecutor demanded his share of holiness, of the Light. However, Avraham %0adid not wish to give anything of holiness to impurity. Rather, he wanted to %0aovercome its power and push it away from himself completely. This is why the %0aprosecutor ascended Above and accused Avraham. %0a%0aThe Zohar tells us that the prosecutor was not really poor, but only disguised %0ahimself as such, and demanded to be treated at Avraham's festive table. Avraham %0afelt that this was an impure force that assumed the image of a poor man; hence, %0ahe refused to give it anything. %0a%0aThis is why it is written: "He did not sacrifice even a single pigeon," for %0ain accordance to the sacrificial rites (rejection of egoistic parts, of man's "I"), %0aonly two pigeons are offered, which symbolize the two combined points in %0aMalchut: the property of Malchut that was corrected by the property of mercy, %0aBina. This common point contains both the properties of restriction and %0amercy, but the property of restriction is concealed, whereas the property of %0amercy is revealed (item 122). %0a%0aWithout this combination of Malchut's properties with those of Bina, %0acalled the "mitigation" or "sweetening" of Malchut, the world (Malchut) %0acannot exist, i.e., receive the Creator's Light. Therefore, it is necessary to %0aoffer precisely two baby pigeons. One of them was sent by Noah from his %0aArk, never to return (Beresheet, 8), for one pigeon designates the property of %0arestriction in Malchut that is unmitigated by Bina's property of mercy. And %0asince Noah could not correct anything in her, the pigeon never returned to %0ahim (The Zohar Shlach, p. 52). %0a%0a%0a%0a362 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe prosecutor's claims and complaints concerning Avraham's feast on the %0aday when Yitzchak was weaned stem from his demand to receive his share, the %0acorrections of the part of Malchut that cannot be corrected until Gmar Tikkun %0a(the end of correction). And this is the property of the restriction within Malchut, %0awith which the world cannot exist; hence, it must be concealed. This property is %0athe pigeon that did not return to Noah. %0a%0aMan was not entrusted with the task of correcting his Creator-given %0aprimordial egoism, for it is impossible to alter what the Creator had made. %0aHowever, man can hide his Malchut, his egoism (refrain from using it), and %0ainstead act by receiving his desires from Bina. This is why a combination of %0athe properties of Malchut (egoism) and Bina (altruism) was formed in man— to %0alet him make the effort and conceal the properties of Malchut, and act only %0aaccording to the properties of Bina. %0a%0aWhen one is able to completely reject the use of his egoism and is guided %0aonly by the properties of Bina, he will achieve a state called "the end of his %0a:tion." Correction is made during the 6,000 years, i.e., along the degre %0a%0aThen, man's Mashiach (Messiah/savior), the Upper Light, comes to him %0aand transforms all of man's egoism (the primordial nature that he was rejecting %0aduring the 6,000 years) into altruism. Then, one's egoistic properties serve for %0athe reception of the Light of pleasure for the Creator's sake, and he no longer %0aneeds to refrain from using them. %0a%0aThe property of Malchut, with which man cannot work for the Creator's %0asake until his final correction, is referred to as "restriction." Using the properties %0aof Malchut herself remains forbidden until she is completely corrected through %0agradual purification by the properties of Bina during the 6,000 years. Alternatively, %0aMalchut is called "strictness" or "judgment," for this restriction is also the source %0aof all punishments and prohibitions. %0a%0aAvraham could not correct this property of restriction in Malchut, i.e., %0areceive the Light and fill Malchut entirely. Hence, he received nothing in this %0apart, and that is exactly the way he treated the prosecutor, who ascended at %0aonce and began to accuse Avraham before the Creator, claiming that Avraham %0afailed to correct anything in Malchut's property of restriction with his feast. This %0aproperty of restriction is called "poor," for it does not receive Light; hence, it %0aconstitutes the essence of Malchut, her egoism. %0a%0aSince the Creator mitigated the restrictive property of Malchut with the %0aproperty of mercy, and mixed Malchut with Bina for the sole purpose of giving the %0a%0a%0a%0aHe Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%0a%0a%0a363 %0a%0a%0a%0aworld an opportunity to exist, the Light that is received thanks to the property %0aof mercy is defined as the part of Light belonging to all the world's inhabitants. %0aThis part helps Malchut become corrected. Since the Creator created Malchut in %0aorder to personally fill her with Light, she is regarded as His personal part. %0a%0aAs a result of a miracle of nursing the babies that were brought to Sarah, %0aAvraham received all the Light that exists in the property of mercy, and began to %0adoubt his ability to correct the poor part of Malchut. This part receives nothing %0a(for it cannot be used during the 6,000 years) and constitutes the Creator's %0apersonal part. %0a%0aTherefore, the prosecutor ascended, accusing Avraham of not giving to the %0apoor, i.e., not giving to the part of the Creator, Malchut de Malchut herself, %0awhich no man can correct by himself, as even Noah was unable to do so. And %0ahe gave nothing to You nor to the poor, and sacrificed not even a single pigeon %0afor Your sake. %0a%0aAnd Sarah says that You have laughed at her. Sarah is the part of Bina %0athat shines in Malchut. With the words: "Any who hears will laugh on account %0aof me" (Beresheet, 21:6), Sarah-Bina gave Malchut such powerful Ohr Hassadim %0athat Malchut stopped feeling her egoistic desires, felt the perfection of altruism, %0aand temporarily acquired the properties of Bina, while under the influence of %0aOhr Hassadim. %0a%0aHowever, there emerges fear that due to such a sense of perfection and %0aabsence of suffering from unfulfilled desires, the absence of the feeling of %0adeficiency, Malchut would remain uncorrected. Such a state is similar to the %0afollowing description of Adam's state in the Torah (Beresheet, 3:22): "Lest he %0aput forth his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever." %0aIn other words, he must not stop feeling his own nature nor forget the fact %0athat he is obliged to correct his defect in the "Tree of Knowledge." And that is %0awhy Adam was cast down into a place that is suitable for correction, the lowest %0apossible egoistic place, called our world. %0a%0a179. The Creator said to him: "Who in the world is like Avraham?" And the %0aprosecutor did not leave from there until he had consumed the entire fare. So %0athe Creator decreed that Yitzchak is to be sacrificed. And He said that Sarah %0ashall die from grief for her son. The cause of this grief is that he did not give %0aanything to the poor. %0a%0aYitzchak's sacrifice was aimed at the correction of Malchut, to compensate %0afor what Avraham could not correct at his great feast in honor of Yitzchak's %0aweaning. Sarah's death was the result of the great Light that she passed to %0a%0a%0a%0a364 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut, saying: "The Creator has made laughter for me," alluding to the Light %0athat obstructs the correction of Malchut. %0a%0aTherefore, the Light that descends to Malchut and gives her the sensation of %0aperfection prevents her from correcting herself. Hence, the Creator stopped it. %0aThis is the significance of Sarah's death, for Sarah constitutes the Light of Bina %0athat enters Malchut. Thus, all that the Torah speaks of is but the essence of the %0aprocess of Malchut's correction, until her correction is completed.

Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "He who rejoices on holidays and does %0a%3c not give a part to the Creator, the evil eye hates and slanders him, removes %0a%3c him from this world, and brings him many miseries." %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already said (item 68) that the impure forces (egoistic spiritual %0a%3c forces within man that know of and hence desire the pleasures hidden in the %0a%3c Creator's Light) consist of male and female parts. The male part brings less harm %0a%3c than the female. It leads man to transgressions such as lying in the name of the %0a%3c Creator, as though it inspires man to observe the Mitzvot, but not in complete %0a%3c purity (with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator). Instead, it causes man %0a%3c to also add a touch of personal benefit and selfish enjoyment, as it is written: %0a%3c "Eat not the bread of an ill-willer, nor desire his treats; for as one reckons within %0a%3c himself, such is he: 'Eat and drink,' he shall say to you; but his heart is not with %0a%3c you" (Mishley, 23:6-7). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the male impure force has absolutely no intentions to bestow, the %0a%3c commandment remains devoid of fear and love (without a heart). Yet, since the %0a%3c male impure force has already caught man in its net, it gains power to make a %0a%3c Zivug with its female half (the impure Nukva), which is a bitter and evil impure %0a%3c force that lies in the name of the Creator, and, upon seducing man, captures %0a%3c his entire soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, The Zohar says that the evil eye hates and slanders man, and removes %0a%3c him from this world by provoking him to fail to observe the commandment of %0a%3c rejoicing on a holiday (the reception of Ohr Hochma, joy on a higher degree)— so %0a%3c that this joy would not be for the sake of the Creator. It is as though he eats %0a%3c alone and does not share his food with the needy, which leads to the male %0a%3c impure force making a Zivug with Nukva and capturing man's soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c 355 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 356 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 175. The Creator's role is to cheer the poor, according to His ability. For the %0a%3c Creator appears on the holidays so as to look at His broken Kelim. He comes %0a%3c to them, and He sees that there is nothing to rejoice in, and He weeps for %0a%3c them, and ascends Above to destroy the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c To understand this passage and the angels' objections, one must first %0a%3c understand the words of the sages (Midrash Raba, 86): "When creating the world, %0a%3c the Creator asked the angels: 'Shall we create man in our image (T^elem) and %0a%3c likeness?' And the four angels (forces, properties) of creation gave their answers: %0a%3c %0a%3c Mercy said, LET US CREATE, for he creates Hassadim, mercy. Truth %0a%3c said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he is all falsehood. Justice said, LET US %0a%3c CREATE, for he dispenses justice. Peace said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he %0a%3c is all enmity." %0a%3c %0a%3c What did the Creator do? He took truth and concealed it in the ground, as %0a%3c it is written: "cast down truth to the ground" (Daniel, 8: 12). Our entire purpose %0a%3c in the study of the Torah and Mitzvot lies in that, thanks to them, as the Talmud %0a%3c says (Psachim, 50, 2): "From Lo Lishma (intentions for oneself) man comes to %0a%3c Lishma (intentions for the Creator's sake)." %0a%3c %0a%3c And since man is born with such insignificant desires and powers, he is %0a%3c unable to immediately engage in the Creator's Mitzvot for the sake of pleasing %0a%3c the Giver of these Mitzvot, for as it is said: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" (lyov, %0a%3c 11:12). Due to his egoistic nature, he is unable to make any inner movement or %0a%3c action if it is not for his own benefit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator allows man to begin observing the Mitzvot solely for %0a%3c his own sake, seeking personal benefit. Yet, in spite of this, his actions attract %0a%3c spiritual Light to him. And then, with the help of the received Light, he comes %0a%3c to observe the Mitzvot for the Creator's sake, in order to please Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is exactly what Truth presented when it objected to man's creation %0a%3c and said that he is all falsehood. After all, how can man be created to study the %0a%3c Torah and observe Mitzvot in a state of absolute falsehood, i.e., "for oneself?" %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Mercy said, "Let us create," for man performs merciful deeds. %0a%3c Although the Mitzvot of mercy, which man observes (even if mechanically) initially %0a%3c "for his own sake," are mere external actions without the intention of bestowal, %0a%3c with their help he gradually corrects his intentions until he becomes capable of %0a%3c observing all the Mitzvot "for the Creator's sake." Hence, there exists an absolute %0a%3c certainty and guarantee that through his efforts, man will achieve the goal- %0a%3c altruistic actions "for the Creator's sake." And that it is okay to create man. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 357 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Peace also asserted that man is all "enmity;" hence, he can observe the Mitzvot %0a%3c "for the Creator's sake" only if it also brings him personal benefit. However, due %0a%3c to such mixed intentions and actions, man exists in constant conflict with the %0a%3c Creator, for it seems to him that he is great and righteous, and he utterly fails to %0a%3c see his shortcomings. In other words, he is completely unaware that all his work %0a%3c in the Torah and Mitzvot is exclusively for his own benefit. %0a%3c %0a%3c And because he feels this way, he fills up with anger and resentment towards %0a%3c the Creator: why does the Creator not treat him as it befits one so perfectly %0a%3c righteous? It follows that he alternates between states of peace and conflict with %0a%3c the Creator. That is why Peace objected to the creation of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Justice said that man should be created, for he dispenses justice. %0a%3c By observing the Mitzva (singular for Mitzvot) of giving charity to the poor, even %0a%3c with the intention "for oneself," he gradually acquires the property of "bestowal," %0a%3c learns to act "for the Creator's sake," and merits eternal peace with Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Creator heard these opinions, He agreed with the angels of %0a%3c Mercy and Justice, and cast down Truth to the "ground." By this, He allowed %0a%3c man to begin observing the Mitzvot with the intention "for oneself," despite %0a%3c its falsehood. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that the Creator cast Truth down to the ground because He had %0a%3c accepted the claims of Mercy and Justice, that thanks to the Mitzva of giving %0a%3c charity to the poor, man will ultimately come to Truth, i.e., work for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, and Truth will rise from the ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c The only creation created by the Creator is Malchut de Malchut, egoism, %0a%3c and it can only be corrected by "instilling" the Creator's properties of Bina %0a%3c or mercy into it. Yet, if these properties are opposite, how can such a thing be %0a%3c accomplished? After all, in the spiritual world, distance is proportionate to the %0a%3c difference in properties. So how can Malchut be united with Bina? %0a%3c %0a%3c To this end, the Kli was broken: the spiritual, altruistic desire lost its screen %0a%3c and became egoistic. Yet, it retained sparks of the Light, and these sparks exist %0a%3c within egoistic desires. This is why egoistic desires have power over us. %0a%3c %0a%3c These sparks of the Upper Light are the source of various pleasures and love, %0a%3c for Light is pleasure. And since these particles of Light are clothed in impure %0a%3c garments and exist under the rule of the impure forces, man starts perceiving %0a%3c these feelings of love and delight as being inherent in the impure forces, as %0a%3c though these egoistic garments contain pleasures, and such is their property. %0a%3c And he associates the properties of love and pleasure with the impure forces, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 358 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c failing to understand that the impure forces draw him solely with the spiritual %0a%3c spark that has fallen into them. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, as the impure force is very appealing, it lures man into all kinds %0a%3c of transgressions, such as theft, robbery, and murder. At the same time, it gives %0a%3c us the desire to observe the Torah and Mitzvot for our own sake. Even if we start %0a%3c observing them not "for the Creator's sake," but "for ourselves," (for our own %0a%3c benefit, to fulfill our base aspirations, according to the desires of the broken, %0a%3c egoistic JCelim-vessels), we gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's %0a%3c sake," and merit the goal of creation— to receive all the pleasure that was prepared %0a%3c for us back in the Thought of Creation— "to delight man." Thus, the impure %0a%3c forces destroy themselves, but that is exactly the purpose for which the Creator %0a%3c conceived and created them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar says that the Creator appears on these holidays to look at all the %0a%3c broken Kelim. On holidays, when man observes the Mitzva of rejoicing because %0a%3c of the great Light that he receives from the Creator, the Creator appears to look %0a%3c at His broken vessels, by which man is given an opportunity to observe the %0a%3c Mitzvot not "for the Creator's sake." The Creator comes and looks at how well %0a%3c these broken vessels have fulfilled their mission to bring man to observance of %0a%3c the Mitzvot with the intention "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator comes to them and sees that there is nothing to rejoice %0a%3c in. He weeps over them, for He sees that nothing spiritual (altruistic) was created %0a%3c from the broken vessels, that man has yet to correct even a single broken vessel %0a%3c (egoistic desire). In other words, there's not one vessel that was intentionally %0a%3c broken by the Creator that has brought man to the intention "for the Creator's %0a%3c sake," and he rejoices on holidays solely for his own pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the Creator weeps and regrets breaking the vessels, for He broke them %0a%3c and cast Truth to the ground only for man's sake, to give him an opportunity to %0a%3c start working in falsehood (in the intention "for oneself) and gradually come %0a%3c to Truth, to the intention "for the Creator's sake." Yet, when He sees that man %0a%3c has not changed at all in his aspirations for selfish pleasure, it is as though the %0a%3c vessels were broken in vain, and so He weeps for them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And He rises Above, to destroy the world— meaning, He ascends so as to stop %0a%3c the Light's descent and thereby destroy the world. The world and creatures can %0a%3c exist only if they receive the Creator's Light (even if unconsciously). However, %0a%3c if man's state and selfish actions cannot lead him to the intention "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake," the Light itself becomes detrimental to him, for in pursuit of this %0a%3c Light, man sinks ever deeper into egoistic desires (impure forces) and growing %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 359 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c dependency on egoism. Therefore, it is more desirable and beneficial for man %0a%3c to stop feeling pleasure in his impure desires, so that it would not destroy him %0a%3c completely and prevent him from sinking into such powerful egoistic desires %0a%3c that, having become a slave to their pleasures, he would never be able escape %0a%3c them and attain the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c 176. The members of the assembly then appear before the Creator and say: %0a%3c "Master of the world, You are called merciful and forgiving, send Your mercy %0a%3c upon Your sons." He answers them: "Have I not done so, when I created the %0a%3c world based on mercy? As it is written, 'The world is built by mercy' and the %0a%3c world is established upon it. However, if they do not show mercy to the poor, %0a%3c the world will be destroyed." The Heavenly angels then say to Him: "Master %0a%3c of the world, here is a man who had eaten and drunk to his heart's content, %0a%3c and could have been merciful to the poor, but did not do anything." The %0a%3c prosecutor appears, receives permission, and persecutes that man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The exalted souls, called "the members (or the sons) of the assembly" begin %0a%3c praying for the lower ones, so the Creator would have mercy on His sons and %0a%3c not discontinue the flow of Light descending onto them. They do everything %0a%3c within their power to justify man's state of being, and say that as long as he %0a%3c observes his Mitzvot in faith, he is called "the Creator's son," and hence deserves %0a%3c the Creator's mercy, as a son deserves the mercy of his father. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator replies to them that He created the world by the property of %0a%3c mercy, and the world stands on this property alone. In other words, man will %0a%3c not be corrected by the Creator's Light as long as he disdains the poor, for the %0a%3c world's creation was the result of the Creator's agreement with the angel of %0a%3c Mercy, which states that due to man's merciful deeds, the world will be able to %0a%3c exist and will gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's sake." But now, %0a%3c since people are not showing mercy, there will be no correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the Supernal angels said, "Master of the universe, here is a man who %0a%3c had eaten and drunk, and had his fill, and could have been merciful to the poor, %0a%3c but did not give them anything." In this case, the angels begin to accuse man, %0a%3c instead of defending him, even the angels of Mercy and Justice. And all those %0a%3c who did not wish to create an egoistic man with desires "for oneself," but agreed %0a%3c to it only because they assumed that by deeds of mercy and justice he would %0a%3c escape his egoism "for one's own sake" and achieve the altruistic property "for %0a%3c the Creator's sake." Now, they, too, turn against man. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if man is unable to acquire the intention "for the Creator's sake," the %0a%3c angels repent and regret at having agreed to his creation, and they now accuse %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 360 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him before the Creator. And after it becomes clear that man will not achieve the %0a%3c altruistic property "for the Creator's sake" by observing the Mitzvot, he is passed %0a%3c into the hands of the prosecutor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 177. There are none greater in our world than Avraham, who acted with mercy %0a%3c toward all creatures. It is written of the day that he prepared a feast: "The child %0a%3c grew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak %0a%3c was weaned." So Avraham prepared a feast and invited all the leaders of that %0a%3c generation. It is well known that at every feast, the supreme prosecutor is about, %0a%3c watching. And if there are any poor people in the house, he leaves that house %0a%3c and does not return there. However, if the prosecutor enters a house and sees %0a%3c rejoicing without the poor— without having first shown mercy to the poor— he %0a%3c ascends Above and brings accusations against the host of that feast. %0a%3c %0a%3c 178. Because Avraham was the leader of his generation, the prosecutor %0a%3c descended from Heavens and stood at the door of his house, disguised as a %0a%3c poor man. And nobody so much as looked at him. Avraham was attending %0a%3c to kings and ministers, and Sarah was feeding all of their children, for they %0a%3c did not believe that she had born a child, but rather claimed that Yitzchak %0a%3c was a foundling, whom they had bought at the marketplace. This is why they %0a%3c brought their children with them, and Sarah nursed them in front of all. And %0a%3c the prosecutor stands at the door. Sarah said: "The Creator has made laughter %0a%3c for me" ("For anyone who hears will laugh on account of me" (Beresheet, %0a%3c 21:6). The prosecutor ascended at once and stood before the Creator, and said %0a%3c to Him, "O Master of the world, You have said that You love Avraham, and %0a%3c here he had prepared a feast, but had not given anything to You nor to the %0a%3c poor, had not sacrificed even a single pigeon for Your sake. And Sarah says %0a%3c that You have laughed at her." %0a%3c %0a%3c Until the end of correction, it is impossible to fully rid oneself of the impure %0a%3c forces. Hence, however hard even the most exalted righteous may try to observe %0a%3c the Creator's Mitzvot in purity of their altruistic intentions, without any touch %0a%3c of personal benefit, the impure forces can nonetheless accuse them and find %0a%3c faults in their observance of the Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator prepared another opportunity for the righteous to %0a%3c silence the prosecutor— by bribing him with a certain portion of holiness and %0a%3c purity, thus silencing him. This way, the prosecutor is reluctant to accuse a %0a%3c righteous one and does not want him to disappear, for then the prosecutor, %0a%3c too, will be deprived of his part of holiness, the Light that he receives as the %0a%3c righteous one observes each Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 361 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the need for external hair in Tefillin (phylacteries), scapegoat rite, red %0a%3c heifer, and so forth. (The Zohar, Emor, p. 88). From this we see how extraordinary, %0a%3c multifaceted, and complex this world is created, how impossible it is to judge %0a%3c human deeds and the Upper Governance by external manifestations, as they are %0a%3c seen by us, and how "entangled" and inseparably intertwined all the connections %0a%3c between the pure and impure forces really are. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even when we look at our great leaders-Kabbalists, we see how much they've %0a%3c suffered, how they were forced to submit to the will of petty rulers or ignorant %0a%3c masses, and how persecuted they were— those who were closest to the Creator! %0a%3c Everyone feels these obstacles, even those who are just beginning on their %0a%3c spiritual journey. %0a%3c %0a%3c But here, in the example of Avraham, The Zohar does not speak about an %0a%3c ordinary prosecutor, for Avraham had surely given food to all the poor, as he %0a%3c had always done even before he invited his distinguished guests to his table. But %0a%3c this prosecutor demanded his share of holiness, of the Light. However, Avraham %0a%3c did not wish to give anything of holiness to impurity. Rather, he wanted to %0a%3c overcome its power and push it away from himself completely. This is why the %0a%3c prosecutor ascended Above and accused Avraham. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that the prosecutor was not really poor, but only disguised %0a%3c himself as such, and demanded to be treated at Avraham's festive table. Avraham %0a%3c felt that this was an impure force that assumed the image of a poor man; hence, %0a%3c he refused to give it anything. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written: "He did not sacrifice even a single pigeon," for %0a%3c in accordance to the sacrificial rites (rejection of egoistic parts, of man's "I"), %0a%3c only two pigeons are offered, which symbolize the two combined points in %0a%3c Malchut: the property of Malchut that was corrected by the property of mercy, %0a%3c Bina. This common point contains both the properties of restriction and %0a%3c mercy, but the property of restriction is concealed, whereas the property of %0a%3c mercy is revealed (item 122). %0a%3c %0a%3c Without this combination of Malchut's properties with those of Bina, %0a%3c called the "mitigation" or "sweetening" of Malchut, the world (Malchut) %0a%3c cannot exist, i.e., receive the Creator's Light. Therefore, it is necessary to %0a%3c offer precisely two baby pigeons. One of them was sent by Noah from his %0a%3c Ark, never to return (Beresheet, 8), for one pigeon designates the property of %0a%3c restriction in Malchut that is unmitigated by Bina's property of mercy. And %0a%3c since Noah could not correct anything in her, the pigeon never returned to %0a%3c him (The Zohar Shlach, p. 52). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 362 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The prosecutor's claims and complaints concerning Avraham's feast on the %0a%3c day when Yitzchak was weaned stem from his demand to receive his share, the %0a%3c corrections of the part of Malchut that cannot be corrected until Gmar Tikkun %0a%3c (the end of correction). And this is the property of the restriction within Malchut, %0a%3c with which the world cannot exist; hence, it must be concealed. This property is %0a%3c the pigeon that did not return to Noah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man was not entrusted with the task of correcting his Creator-given %0a%3c primordial egoism, for it is impossible to alter what the Creator had made. %0a%3c However, man can hide his Malchut, his egoism (refrain from using it), and %0a%3c instead act by receiving his desires from Bina. This is why a combination of %0a%3c the properties of Malchut (egoism) and Bina (altruism) was formed in man— to %0a%3c let him make the effort and conceal the properties of Malchut, and act only %0a%3c according to the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c When one is able to completely reject the use of his egoism and is guided %0a%3c only by the properties of Bina, he will achieve a state called "the end of his %0a%3c :tion." Correction is made during the 6,000 years, i.e., along the degre %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, man's Mashiach (Messiah/savior), the Upper Light, comes to him %0a%3c and transforms all of man's egoism (the primordial nature that he was rejecting %0a%3c during the 6,000 years) into altruism. Then, one's egoistic properties serve for %0a%3c the reception of the Light of pleasure for the Creator's sake, and he no longer %0a%3c needs to refrain from using them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Malchut, with which man cannot work for the Creator's %0a%3c sake until his final correction, is referred to as "restriction." Using the properties %0a%3c of Malchut herself remains forbidden until she is completely corrected through %0a%3c gradual purification by the properties of Bina during the 6,000 years. Alternatively, %0a%3c Malchut is called "strictness" or "judgment," for this restriction is also the source %0a%3c of all punishments and prohibitions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham could not correct this property of restriction in Malchut, i.e., %0a%3c receive the Light and fill Malchut entirely. Hence, he received nothing in this %0a%3c part, and that is exactly the way he treated the prosecutor, who ascended at %0a%3c once and began to accuse Avraham before the Creator, claiming that Avraham %0a%3c failed to correct anything in Malchut's property of restriction with his feast. This %0a%3c property of restriction is called "poor," for it does not receive Light; hence, it %0a%3c constitutes the essence of Malchut, her egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Creator mitigated the restrictive property of Malchut with the %0a%3c property of mercy, and mixed Malchut with Bina for the sole purpose of giving the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 363 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c world an opportunity to exist, the Light that is received thanks to the property %0a%3c of mercy is defined as the part of Light belonging to all the world's inhabitants. %0a%3c This part helps Malchut become corrected. Since the Creator created Malchut in %0a%3c order to personally fill her with Light, she is regarded as His personal part. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of a miracle of nursing the babies that were brought to Sarah, %0a%3c Avraham received all the Light that exists in the property of mercy, and began to %0a%3c doubt his ability to correct the poor part of Malchut. This part receives nothing %0a%3c (for it cannot be used during the 6,000 years) and constitutes the Creator's %0a%3c personal part. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the prosecutor ascended, accusing Avraham of not giving to the %0a%3c poor, i.e., not giving to the part of the Creator, Malchut de Malchut herself, %0a%3c which no man can correct by himself, as even Noah was unable to do so. And %0a%3c he gave nothing to You nor to the poor, and sacrificed not even a single pigeon %0a%3c for Your sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c And Sarah says that You have laughed at her. Sarah is the part of Bina %0a%3c that shines in Malchut. With the words: "Any who hears will laugh on account %0a%3c of me" (Beresheet, 21:6), Sarah-Bina gave Malchut such powerful Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c that Malchut stopped feeling her egoistic desires, felt the perfection of altruism, %0a%3c and temporarily acquired the properties of Bina, while under the influence of %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there emerges fear that due to such a sense of perfection and %0a%3c absence of suffering from unfulfilled desires, the absence of the feeling of %0a%3c deficiency, Malchut would remain uncorrected. Such a state is similar to the %0a%3c following description of Adam's state in the Torah (Beresheet, 3:22): "Lest he %0a%3c put forth his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever." %0a%3c In other words, he must not stop feeling his own nature nor forget the fact %0a%3c that he is obliged to correct his defect in the "Tree of Knowledge." And that is %0a%3c why Adam was cast down into a place that is suitable for correction, the lowest %0a%3c possible egoistic place, called our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 179. The Creator said to him: "Who in the world is like Avraham?" And the %0a%3c prosecutor did not leave from there until he had consumed the entire fare. So %0a%3c the Creator decreed that Yitzchak is to be sacrificed. And He said that Sarah %0a%3c shall die from grief for her son. The cause of this grief is that he did not give %0a%3c anything to the poor. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak's sacrifice was aimed at the correction of Malchut, to compensate %0a%3c for what Avraham could not correct at his great feast in honor of Yitzchak's %0a%3c weaning. Sarah's death was the result of the great Light that she passed to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 364 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, saying: "The Creator has made laughter for me," alluding to the Light %0a%3c that obstructs the correction of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Light that descends to Malchut and gives her the sensation of %0a%3c perfection prevents her from correcting herself. Hence, the Creator stopped it. %0a%3c This is the significance of Sarah's death, for Sarah constitutes the Light of Bina %0a%3c that enters Malchut. Thus, all that the Torah speaks of is but the essence of the %0a%3c process of Malchut's correction, until her correction is completed. %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
