csum=[[LH]], androstenedione, [[cortisol]], 17b-[[estradiol]] elevated in hair loss [[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/247797|#]].  LH and androstenedione are from anterior pituitary. Cortisol is released to supress [[immune system]] [[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol|#]] probably to prevent [[inflammation]].  Cortisol is also stimulated by anterior pituitary via [[IL-1]] [[IL-6]] [[TNF-a]]. Cortisol inhibits tnf-alpha release and reduces responsiveness to [[IL1]]. Androstenedione is converted to estradiol via [[aromatase]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol|#]].  I think on all of this we can confidently say that hair loss for men is an anterior pituitary over activation probably from a testicular [[testis]] problem like [[hydrocele]] from something like [[strongyloides]].
