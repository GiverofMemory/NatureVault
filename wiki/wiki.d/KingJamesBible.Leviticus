as the LORD commanded.%0a%0a9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin%0aoffering, which was for himself.%0a%0a9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped%0ahis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and%0apoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and%0athe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he%0aburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%0a9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.%0a%0a9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto%0ahim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.%0a%0a9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces%0athereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.%0a%0a9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the%0aburnt offering on the altar.%0a%0a9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which%0awas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for%0asin, as the first.%0a%0a9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to%0athe manner.%0a%0a9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,%0aand burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the%0amorning.%0a%0a9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace%0aofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto%0ahim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And%0athe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which%0acovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:%0a9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon%0athe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for%0aa wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.%0a%0a9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,%0aand came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt%0aoffering, and peace offerings.%0a%0a9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,%0aand came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD%0aappeared unto all the people.%0a%0a9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon%0athe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people%0asaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.%0a%0a10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his%0acenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered%0astrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.%0a%0a10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and%0athey died before the LORD.%0a%0a10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,%0asaying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all%0athe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.%0a%0a10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the%0auncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren%0afrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.%0a%0a10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the%0acamp; as Moses had said.%0a%0a10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his%0asons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,%0aand lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the%0awhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.%0a%0a10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the%0acongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon%0ayou. And they did according to the word of Moses.%0a%0a10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor%0astrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the%0atabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for%0aever throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference%0abetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that%0aye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD%0ahath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.%0a%0a10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,%0ahis sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the%0aofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside%0athe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy%0aplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of%0athe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.%0a%0a10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean%0aplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be%0athy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of%0apeace offerings of the children of Israel.%0a%0a10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the%0aofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering%0abefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a%0astatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.%0a%0a10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,%0abehold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the%0asons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye%0anot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,%0aand God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to%0amake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of%0ait was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have%0aeaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.%0a%0a10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered%0atheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such%0athings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,%0ashould it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when%0aMoses heard that, he was content.%0a%0a11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,%0a11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts%0awhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.%0a%0a11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the%0acud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.%0a%0a11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or%0aof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the%0acud, but divideth not the hoof;

he also shall%0a%3c be unclean, and guilty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it%0a%3c be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he%0a%3c knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do%0a%3c good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it%0a%3c be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one%0a%3c of these.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,%0a%3c that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And he%0a%3c shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he%0a%3c hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,%0a%3c for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him%0a%3c concerning his sin.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his%0a%3c trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young%0a%3c pigeons, unto the LORD;

though he wist%0a%3c it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with%0a%3c thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the%0a%3c priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance%0a%3c wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against%0a%3c the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and%0a%3c commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that%0a%3c which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken%0a%3c away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have found%0a%3c that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in%0a%3c any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shall%0a%3c be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that%0a%3c which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully%0a%3c gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing%0a%3c which he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he%0a%3c shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part%0a%3c more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day%0a%3c of his trespass offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram%0a%3c without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass%0a%3c offering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement%0a%3c for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of%0a%3c all that he hath done in trespassing therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his%0a%3c sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt%0a%3c offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the%0a%3c morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen%0a%3c breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the%0a%3c fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall%0a%3c put them beside the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and%0a%3c carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not%0a%3c be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and%0a%3c lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the%0a%3c fat of the peace offerings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go%0a%3c out.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall%0a%3c offer it before the LORD, before the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat%0a%3c offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is%0a%3c upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet%0a%3c savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with%0a%3c unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of%0a%3c the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for%0a%3c their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the%0a%3c sin offering, and as the trespass offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It%0a%3c shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the%0a%3c offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall%0a%3c be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering%0a%3c of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the%0a%3c day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for%0a%3c a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof%0a%3c at night.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou%0a%3c shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt%0a%3c thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall%0a%3c offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly%0a%3c burnt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it%0a%3c shall not be eaten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and%0a%3c to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place%0a%3c where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed%0a%3c before the LORD: it is most holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy%0a%3c place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when%0a%3c there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt%0a%3c wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and%0a%3c if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed%0a%3c in water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most%0a%3c holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,%0a%3c shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most%0a%3c holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill%0a%3c the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round%0a%3c about upon the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the%0a%3c fat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat%0a%3c that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above%0a%3c the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priest%0a%3c shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the%0a%3c LORD: it is a trespass offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten%0a%3c in the holy place: it is most holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one%0a%3c law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have%0a%3c it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the%0a%3c priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he%0a%3c hath offered.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that%0a%3c is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's%0a%3c that offereth it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the%0a%3c sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he%0a%3c shall offer unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the%0a%3c sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and%0a%3c unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of%0a%3c fine flour, fried.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread%0a%3c with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an%0a%3c heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that%0a%3c sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for%0a%3c thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;

and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the%0a%3c horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the%0a%3c altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified%0a%3c it, to make reconciliation upon it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul%0a%3c above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned%0a%3c it upon the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt%0a%3c with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his%0a%3c sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar%0a%3c round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the%0a%3c pieces, and the fat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt%0a%3c the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet%0a%3c savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD%0a%3c commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron%0a%3c and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it%0a%3c upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right%0a%3c hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the%0a%3c tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and%0a%3c upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood%0a%3c upon the altar round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon%0a%3c the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and%0a%3c their fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket of%0a%3c unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened%0a%3c cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the%0a%3c fat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron's%0a%3c hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering%0a%3c before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the%0a%3c altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet%0a%3c savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering%0a%3c before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as%0a%3c the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was%0a%3c upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,%0a%3c and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and%0a%3c sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'%0a%3c garments with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the%0a%3c door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the%0a%3c bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,%0a%3c Aaron and his sons shall eat it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye%0a%3c burn with fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at%0a%3c an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to%0a%3c make an atonement for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the%0a%3c LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by%0a%3c the hand of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and%0a%3c his sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take%0a%3c thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,%0a%3c without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye%0a%3c a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of%0a%3c the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also a%0a%3c bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;%0a%3c and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear%0a%3c unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle%0a%3c of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood%0a%3c before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye%0a%3c should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin%0a%3c offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,%0a%3c and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an%0a%3c atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin%0a%3c offering, which was for himself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped%0a%3c his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and%0a%3c poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, and%0a%3c the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he%0a%3c burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto%0a%3c him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces%0a%3c thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the%0a%3c burnt offering on the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which%0a%3c was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for%0a%3c sin, as the first.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to%0a%3c the manner.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,%0a%3c and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the%0a%3c morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace%0a%3c offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto%0a%3c him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 And%0a%3c the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which%0a%3c covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:%0a%3c 9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon%0a%3c the altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for%0a%3c a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,%0a%3c and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt%0a%3c offering, and peace offerings.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,%0a%3c and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD%0a%3c appeared unto all the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon%0a%3c the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people%0a%3c saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his%0a%3c censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered%0a%3c strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and%0a%3c they died before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,%0a%3c saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all%0a%3c the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the%0a%3c uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren%0a%3c from before the sanctuary out of the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the%0a%3c camp; as Moses had said.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his%0a%3c sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,%0a%3c and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the%0a%3c whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon%0a%3c you. And they did according to the word of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor%0a%3c strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the%0a%3c tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for%0a%3c ever throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put difference%0a%3c between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And that%0a%3c ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD%0a%3c hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,%0a%3c his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the%0a%3c offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside%0a%3c the altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holy%0a%3c place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of%0a%3c the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean%0a%3c place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be%0a%3c thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of%0a%3c peace offerings of the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the%0a%3c offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering%0a%3c before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a%0a%3c statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,%0a%3c behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the%0a%3c sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have ye%0a%3c not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,%0a%3c and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to%0a%3c make atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood of%0a%3c it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have%0a%3c eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.%0a%3c %0a%3c 10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered%0a%3c their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such%0a%3c things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,%0a%3c should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And when%0a%3c Moses heard that, he was content.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,%0a%3c 11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts%0a%3c which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the%0a%3c cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or%0a%3c of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the%0a%3c cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the%0a%3c hoof; he is unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the%0a%3c hoof; he is unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,%0a%3c yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not%0a%3c touch; they are unclean to you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath%0a%3c fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them%0a%3c shall ye eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the%0a%3c rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which%0a%3c is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 They%0a%3c shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their%0a%3c flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be%0a%3c an abomination unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the%0a%3c fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,%0a%3c and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 And the vulture, and the kite%0a%3c after his kind; 11:15 Every raven after his kind; 11:16 And the owl,%0a%3c and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17%0a%3c And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 And%0a%3c the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 And the stork,%0a%3c the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:20 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an%0a%3c abomination unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth%0a%3c upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon%0a%3c the earth; 11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his%0a%3c kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his%0a%3c kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,%0a%3c shall be an abomination unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the%0a%3c carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash%0a%3c his clothes, and be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not%0a%3c clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one%0a%3c that toucheth them shall be unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts%0a%3c that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their%0a%3c carcase shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,%0a%3c and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things%0a%3c that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise%0a%3c after his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the%0a%3c lizard, and the snail, and the mole.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth%0a%3c touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,%0a%3c it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or%0a%3c skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it%0a%3c must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it%0a%3c shall be cleansed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,%0a%3c whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:34 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh%0a%3c shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel%0a%3c shall be unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:35 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth%0a%3c shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall%0a%3c be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of%0a%3c water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be%0a%3c unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which%0a%3c is to be sown, it shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:38 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their%0a%3c carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the%0a%3c carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,%0a%3c and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it%0a%3c shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be%0a%3c an abomination; it shall not be eaten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all%0a%3c four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that%0a%3c creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an%0a%3c abomination.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing%0a%3c that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,%0a%3c that ye should be defiled thereby.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify%0a%3c yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye%0a%3c defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon%0a%3c the earth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,%0a%3c to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every%0a%3c living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that%0a%3c creepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between the%0a%3c unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the%0a%3c beast that may not be eaten.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a%0a%3c man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days%0a%3c of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be%0a%3c circumcised.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three%0a%3c and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the%0a%3c sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two%0a%3c weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of%0a%3c her purifying threescore and six days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or%0a%3c for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt%0a%3c offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,%0a%3c unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:%0a%3c 12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for%0a%3c her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is%0a%3c the law for her that hath born a male or a female.%0a%3c %0a%3c 12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two%0a%3c turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the%0a%3c other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for%0a%3c her, and she shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man%0a%3c shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,%0a%3c and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he%0a%3c shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the%0a%3c priests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of%0a%3c the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the%0a%3c plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague%0a%3c of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him%0a%3c unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in%0a%3c sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned%0a%3c white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven%0a%3c days: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,%0a%3c behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread%0a%3c not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:%0a%3c 13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,%0a%3c behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in%0a%3c the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and%0a%3c he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he%0a%3c hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of%0a%3c the priest again.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the%0a%3c skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought%0a%3c unto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if%0a%3c the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,%0a%3c and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosy%0a%3c in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,%0a%3c and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy%0a%3c cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to%0a%3c his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shall%0a%3c consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he%0a%3c shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned%0a%3c white: he is clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be%0a%3c unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he%0a%3c shall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,%0a%3c behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall%0a%3c pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,%0a%3c and is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white%0a%3c rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be%0a%3c shewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,%0a%3c it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned%0a%3c white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of%0a%3c leprosy broken out of the boil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white%0a%3c hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat%0a%3c dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if it%0a%3c spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him%0a%3c unclean: it is a plague.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is%0a%3c a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot%0a%3c burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,%0a%3c somewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:%0a%3c and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be%0a%3c in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the%0a%3c burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the%0a%3c plague of leprosy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white%0a%3c hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but%0a%3c be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27%0a%3c And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be%0a%3c spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him%0a%3c unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the%0a%3c skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the%0a%3c priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the%0a%3c burning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;%0a%3c 13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in%0a%3c sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;%0a%3c then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a%0a%3c leprosy upon the head or beard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,%0a%3c it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black%0a%3c hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of%0a%3c the scall seven days: 13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall%0a%3c look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be%0a%3c in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the%0a%3c skin; 13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and%0a%3c the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:%0a%3c 13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,%0a%3c behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper%0a%3c than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall%0a%3c wash his clothes, and be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;%0a%3c 13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be%0a%3c spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is%0a%3c unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is%0a%3c black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the%0a%3c priest shall pronounce him clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright%0a%3c spots, even white bright spots; 13:39 Then the priest shall look: and,%0a%3c behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish%0a%3c white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet%0a%3c is he clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head%0a%3c toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white%0a%3c reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald%0a%3c forehead.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising%0a%3c of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald%0a%3c forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 He%0a%3c is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him%0a%3c utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,%0a%3c and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and%0a%3c shall cry, Unclean, unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be%0a%3c defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall%0a%3c his habitation be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be%0a%3c a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in the%0a%3c warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any%0a%3c thing made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in%0a%3c the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in%0a%3c any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto%0a%3c the priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut%0a%3c up it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on the%0a%3c plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,%0a%3c either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that%0a%3c is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in%0a%3c woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for%0a%3c it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not%0a%3c spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any%0a%3c thing of skin; 13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the%0a%3c thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:%0a%3c 13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is%0a%3c washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and%0a%3c the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the%0a%3c fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark%0a%3c after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or%0a%3c out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 And if%0a%3c it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or%0a%3c in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that%0a%3c wherein the plague is with fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of%0a%3c skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from%0a%3c them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen%0a%3c or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to%0a%3c pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 This shall be the law%0a%3c of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the%0a%3c priest: 14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the%0a%3c priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in%0a%3c the leper; 14:4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is%0a%3c to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,%0a%3c and hyssop: 14:5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be%0a%3c killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 As for the living%0a%3c bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the%0a%3c hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the%0a%3c bird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 And he shall%0a%3c sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,%0a%3c and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose%0a%3c into the open field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave%0a%3c off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and%0a%3c after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of%0a%3c his tent seven days.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his%0a%3c hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he%0a%3c shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his%0a%3c flesh in water, and he shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without%0a%3c blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three%0a%3c tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and%0a%3c one log of oil.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:11 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that%0a%3c is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of%0a%3c the tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 And the priest shall take%0a%3c one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of%0a%3c oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 14:13 And he%0a%3c shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering%0a%3c and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is%0a%3c the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 And%0a%3c the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and%0a%3c the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is%0a%3c to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the%0a%3c great toe of his right foot: 14:15 And the priest shall take some of%0a%3c the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16%0a%3c And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his%0a%3c left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times%0a%3c before the LORD: 14:17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand%0a%3c shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to%0a%3c be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great%0a%3c toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18%0a%3c And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour%0a%3c upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make%0a%3c an atonement for him before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an%0a%3c atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and%0a%3c afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shall%0a%3c offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the%0a%3c priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take%0a%3c one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for%0a%3c him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat%0a%3c offering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two young%0a%3c pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin%0a%3c offering, and the other a burnt offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto%0a%3c the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,%0a%3c before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and%0a%3c the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering%0a%3c before the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass%0a%3c offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass%0a%3c offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to%0a%3c be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great%0a%3c toe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into%0a%3c the palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinkle%0a%3c with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven%0a%3c times before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil that%0a%3c is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be%0a%3c cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe%0a%3c of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass%0a%3c offering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand%0a%3c he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an%0a%3c atonement for him before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young%0a%3c pigeons, such as he can get;

14:35 And he that owneth the house shall come and%0a%3c tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague%0a%3c in the house: 14:36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the%0a%3c house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that%0a%3c is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go%0a%3c in to see the house: 14:37 And he shall look on the plague, and,%0a%3c behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow%0a%3c strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;%0a%3c 14:38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the%0a%3c house, and shut up the house seven days: 14:39 And the priest shall%0a%3c come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague%0a%3c be spread in the walls of the house; 14:40 Then the priest shall%0a%3c command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and%0a%3c they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 14:41 And%0a%3c he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they%0a%3c shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an%0a%3c unclean place: 14:42 And they shall take other stones, and put them in%0a%3c the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall%0a%3c plaister the house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after%0a%3c that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the%0a%3c house, and after it is plaistered; 14:44 Then the priest shall come%0a%3c and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a%0a%3c fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the%0a%3c timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry%0a%3c them forth out of the city into an unclean place.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is%0a%3c shut up shall be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he%0a%3c that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:48 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,%0a%3c the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was%0a%3c plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because%0a%3c the plague is healed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar%0a%3c wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 14:50 And he shall kill the one of the%0a%3c birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:51 And he shall take%0a%3c the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,%0a%3c and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,%0a%3c and sprinkle the house seven times: 14:52 And he shall cleanse the%0a%3c house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with%0a%3c the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and%0a%3c with the scarlet: 14:53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the%0a%3c city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it%0a%3c shall be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 14:54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,%0a%3c 14:55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 14:56 And for%0a%3c a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 14:57 To teach when%0a%3c it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 15:2 Speak%0a%3c unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a%0a%3c running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh%0a%3c run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his%0a%3c uncleanness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and%0a%3c every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe%0a%3c himself in water, and be unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:6 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the%0a%3c issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be%0a%3c unclean until the even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall%0a%3c wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the%0a%3c even.%0a%3c %0a%3c 15:8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;

16:2 And the LORD%0a%3c said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all%0a%3c times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which%0a%3c is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon%0a%3c the mercy seat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock%0a%3c for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen%0a%3c breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and%0a%3c with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;%0a%3c therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel%0a%3c two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt%0a%3c offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is%0a%3c for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD%0a%3c at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the%0a%3c LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,%0a%3c and offer him for a sin offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall%0a%3c be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and%0a%3c to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is%0a%3c for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his%0a%3c house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for%0a%3c himself: 16:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of%0a%3c fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet%0a%3c incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 16:13 And he shall%0a%3c put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the%0a%3c incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he%0a%3c die not: 16:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and%0a%3c sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before%0a%3c the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven%0a%3c times.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the%0a%3c people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as%0a%3c he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy%0a%3c seat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 And he shall make an atonement%0a%3c for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of%0a%3c Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so%0a%3c shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth%0a%3c among them in the midst of their uncleanness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation%0a%3c when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come%0a%3c out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household,%0a%3c and for all the congregation of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and%0a%3c make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,%0a%3c and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar%0a%3c round about.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven%0a%3c times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the%0a%3c children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and%0a%3c the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the%0a%3c live goat: 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of%0a%3c the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children%0a%3c of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting%0a%3c them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of%0a%3c a fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him%0a%3c all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go%0a%3c the goat in the wilderness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,%0a%3c and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went%0a%3c into the holy place, and shall leave them there: 16:24 And he shall%0a%3c wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments,%0a%3c and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering%0a%3c of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his%0a%3c clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the%0a%3c camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin%0a%3c offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy%0a%3c place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in%0a%3c the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his%0a%3c flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the%0a%3c seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your%0a%3c souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country,%0a%3c or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 16:30 For on that day shall%0a%3c the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be%0a%3c clean from all your sins before the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict%0a%3c your souls, by a statute for ever.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall%0a%3c consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead,%0a%3c shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the%0a%3c holy garments: 16:33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy%0a%3c sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the%0a%3c congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for%0a%3c the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 16:34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an%0a%3c atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.%0a%3c And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto Aaron, and%0a%3c unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them;%0a%3c This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying, 17:3 What man%0a%3c soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb,%0a%3c or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 17:4 And%0a%3c bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,%0a%3c to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD;%0a%3c blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man%0a%3c shall be cut off from among his people: 17:5 To the end that the%0a%3c children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the%0a%3c open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door%0a%3c of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them%0a%3c for peace offerings unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the%0a%3c LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the%0a%3c fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after%0a%3c whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto%0a%3c them throughout their generations.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the%0a%3c house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that%0a%3c offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 17:9 And bringeth it not unto%0a%3c the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the%0a%3c LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the%0a%3c strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I%0a%3c will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will%0a%3c cut him off from among his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it%0a%3c to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is%0a%3c the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you%0a%3c shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you%0a%3c eat blood.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the%0a%3c strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast%0a%3c or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,%0a%3c and cover it with dust.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:14 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life%0a%3c thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat%0a%3c the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the%0a%3c blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that%0a%3c which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or%0a%3c a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in%0a%3c water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.%0a%3c %0a%3c 17:16 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear%0a%3c his iniquity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye%0a%3c not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring%0a%3c you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk%0a%3c therein: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a%0a%3c man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to%0a%3c uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,%0a%3c shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her%0a%3c nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:8 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is%0a%3c thy father's nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or%0a%3c daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad,%0a%3c even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:10 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's%0a%3c daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is%0a%3c thine own nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:11 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy%0a%3c father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she%0a%3c is thy father's near kinswoman.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for%0a%3c she is thy mother's near kinswoman.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,%0a%3c thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she%0a%3c is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it%0a%3c is thy brother's nakedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her%0a%3c daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her%0a%3c daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near%0a%3c kinswomen: it is wickedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to%0a%3c uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her%0a%3c nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,%0a%3c to defile thyself with her.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to%0a%3c Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is%0a%3c abomination.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself%0a%3c therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down%0a%3c thereto: it is confusion.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all%0a%3c these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 18:25 And%0a%3c the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon%0a%3c it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall%0a%3c not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation,%0a%3c nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 18:27 (For all these%0a%3c abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and%0a%3c the land is defiled;) 18:28 That the land spue not you out also, when%0a%3c ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the%0a%3c souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 18:30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any%0a%3c one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and%0a%3c that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 19:2 Speak unto all the%0a%3c congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be%0a%3c holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my%0a%3c sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am%0a%3c the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye%0a%3c shall offer it at your own will.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:%0a%3c and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the%0a%3c fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it%0a%3c shall not be accepted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,%0a%3c because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul%0a%3c shall be cut off from among his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly%0a%3c reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings%0a%3c of thy harvest.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather%0a%3c every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and%0a%3c stranger: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to%0a%3c another.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou%0a%3c profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages%0a%3c of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the%0a%3c morning.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before%0a%3c the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not%0a%3c respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty:%0a%3c but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:%0a%3c neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in%0a%3c any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children%0a%3c of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender%0a%3c with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:%0a%3c neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,%0a%3c betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given%0a%3c her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because%0a%3c she was not free.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the%0a%3c door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass%0a%3c offering.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of%0a%3c the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done:%0a%3c and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all%0a%3c manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as%0a%3c uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it%0a%3c shall not be eaten of.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to%0a%3c praise the LORD withal.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it%0a%3c may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use%0a%3c enchantment, nor observe times.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou%0a%3c mar the corners of thy beard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor%0a%3c print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest%0a%3c the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after%0a%3c wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of%0a%3c the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not%0a%3c vex him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one%0a%3c born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were%0a%3c strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in%0a%3c weight, or in measure.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall%0a%3c ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of%0a%3c Egypt.%0a%3c %0a%3c 19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my%0a%3c judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2 Again, thou shalt say%0a%3c to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel,%0a%3c or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his%0a%3c seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the%0a%3c land shall stone him with stones.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off%0a%3c from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech,%0a%3c to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from%0a%3c the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:%0a%3c 20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,%0a%3c and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit%0a%3c whoredom with Molech, from among their people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,%0a%3c and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face%0a%3c against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD%0a%3c your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which%0a%3c sanctify you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be%0a%3c surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his%0a%3c blood shall be upon him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,%0a%3c even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the%0a%3c adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his%0a%3c father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their%0a%3c blood shall be upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall%0a%3c surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall%0a%3c be upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both%0a%3c of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to%0a%3c death; their blood shall be upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they%0a%3c shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no%0a%3c wickedness among you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:%0a%3c and ye shall slay the beast.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,%0a%3c thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to%0a%3c death; their blood shall be upon them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or%0a%3c his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his%0a%3c nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the%0a%3c sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he%0a%3c shall bear his iniquity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and%0a%3c shall uncover her nakedness;

for her may he be defiled.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his%0a%3c people, to profane himself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they%0a%3c shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their%0a%3c flesh.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of%0a%3c their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread%0a%3c of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither%0a%3c shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto%0a%3c his God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of%0a%3c thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify%0a%3c you, am holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing%0a%3c the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose%0a%3c head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on%0a%3c the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 21:11%0a%3c Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his%0a%3c father, or for his mother; 21:12 Neither shall he go out of the%0a%3c sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the%0a%3c anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these%0a%3c shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to%0a%3c wife.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the%0a%3c LORD do sanctify him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 21:17 Speak unto Aaron,%0a%3c saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any%0a%3c blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not%0a%3c approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any%0a%3c thing superfluous, 21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or%0a%3c brokenhanded, 21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish%0a%3c in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 21:21%0a%3c No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come%0a%3c nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a%0a%3c blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of%0a%3c the holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the%0a%3c altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries:%0a%3c for I the LORD do sanctify them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 21:24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the%0a%3c children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:2 Speak unto Aaron and%0a%3c to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the%0a%3c children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those%0a%3c things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your%0a%3c generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of%0a%3c Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that%0a%3c soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a%0a%3c running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.%0a%3c And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man%0a%3c whose seed goeth from him; 22:5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping%0a%3c thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take%0a%3c uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 22:6 The soul which hath%0a%3c touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the%0a%3c holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward%0a%3c eat of the holy things; because it is his food.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not%0a%3c eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for%0a%3c it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify%0a%3c them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of%0a%3c the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of%0a%3c it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:12 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she%0a%3c may not eat of an offering of the holy things.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have%0a%3c no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,%0a%3c she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat%0a%3c thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall%0a%3c put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest%0a%3c with the holy thing.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of%0a%3c Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

22:19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without%0a%3c blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it%0a%3c shall not be acceptable for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the%0a%3c LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,%0a%3c it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or%0a%3c scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering%0a%3c by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or%0a%3c lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;%0a%3c but for a vow it shall not be accepted.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or%0a%3c crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof%0a%3c in your land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your%0a%3c God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and%0a%3c blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, or%0a%3c a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days%0a%3c under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be%0a%3c accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her%0a%3c young both in one day.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the%0a%3c LORD, offer it at your own will.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it%0a%3c until the morrow: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed%0a%3c among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 22:33%0a%3c That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the%0a%3c LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are%0a%3c my feasts.%0a%3c %0a%3c 23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath%0a%3c of rest, an holy convocation;

And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speak%0a%3c unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the%0a%3c land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt%0a%3c prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 But in the%0a%3c seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for%0a%3c the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt%0a%3c not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a%0a%3c year of rest unto the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and%0a%3c for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for%0a%3c thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall%0a%3c all the increase thereof be meat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven%0a%3c times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall%0a%3c be unto thee forty and nine years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the%0a%3c tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make%0a%3c the trumpet sound throughout all your land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty%0a%3c throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be%0a%3c a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,%0a%3c and ye shall return every man unto his family.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,%0a%3c neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes%0a%3c in it of thy vine undressed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat%0a%3c the increase thereof out of the field.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his%0a%3c possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of%0a%3c thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15%0a%3c According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of%0a%3c thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he%0a%3c shall sell unto thee: 25:16 According to the multitude of years thou%0a%3c shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of%0a%3c years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number%0a%3c of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear%0a%3c thy God:for I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do%0a%3c them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,%0a%3c and dwell therein in safety.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,%0a%3c we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I will%0a%3c command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring%0a%3c forth fruit for three years.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until%0a%3c the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old%0a%3c store.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for%0a%3c ye are strangers and sojourners with me.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a%0a%3c redemption for the land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his%0a%3c possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he%0a%3c redeem that which his brother sold.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to%0a%3c redeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and%0a%3c restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may%0a%3c return unto his possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is%0a%3c sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the%0a%3c year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return%0a%3c unto his possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may%0a%3c redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may%0a%3c he redeem it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then%0a%3c the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to%0a%3c him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in%0a%3c the jubile.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about%0a%3c them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be%0a%3c redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the%0a%3c cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was%0a%3c sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of%0a%3c jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their%0a%3c possession among the children of Israel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;%0a%3c for it is their perpetual possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;%0a%3c then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a%0a%3c sojourner; that he may live with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that%0a%3c thy brother may live with thee.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy%0a%3c victuals for increase.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land%0a%3c of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be%0a%3c sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:%0a%3c 25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with%0a%3c thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children%0a%3c with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the%0a%3c possession of his fathers shall he return.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land%0a%3c of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy%0a%3c God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,%0a%3c shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy%0a%3c bondmen and bondmaids.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among%0a%3c you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,%0a%3c which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after%0a%3c you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for%0a%3c ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule%0a%3c one over another with rigour.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother%0a%3c that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or%0a%3c sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 25:48%0a%3c After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren%0a%3c may redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem%0a%3c him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;%0a%3c or if he be able, he may redeem himself.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that%0a%3c he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale%0a%3c shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of%0a%3c an hired servant shall it be with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall%0a%3c give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was%0a%3c bought for.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then%0a%3c he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give%0a%3c him again the price of his redemption.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the%0a%3c other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out%0a%3c in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my%0a%3c servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD%0a%3c your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up%0a%3c a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your%0a%3c land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;%0a%3c 26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield%0a%3c her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage%0a%3c shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the%0a%3c full, and dwell in your land safely.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and%0a%3c none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the%0a%3c land, neither shall the sword go through your land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you%0a%3c by the sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you%0a%3c shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before%0a%3c you by the sword.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and%0a%3c multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of%0a%3c the new.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor%0a%3c you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be%0a%3c my people.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land%0a%3c of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the%0a%3c bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these%0a%3c commandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your%0a%3c soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,%0a%3c but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; I%0a%3c will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,%0a%3c that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall%0a%3c sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before%0a%3c your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall%0a%3c flee when none pursueth you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will%0a%3c punish you seven times more for your sins.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your%0a%3c heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shall%0a%3c be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither%0a%3c shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I%0a%3c will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of%0a%3c your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;%0a%3c and your high ways shall be desolate.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will%0a%3c walk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you,%0a%3c and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel%0a%3c of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,%0a%3c I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into%0a%3c the hand of the enemy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall%0a%3c bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread%0a%3c again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk%0a%3c contrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in%0a%3c fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your%0a%3c daughters shall ye eat.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,%0a%3c and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul%0a%3c shall abhor you.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries%0a%3c unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies%0a%3c which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a%0a%3c sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities%0a%3c waste.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth%0a%3c desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land%0a%3c rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not%0a%3c rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness%0a%3c into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a%0a%3c shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a%0a%3c sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,%0a%3c when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your%0a%3c enemies.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your%0a%3c enemies shall eat you up.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity%0a%3c in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers%0a%3c shall they pine away with them.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their%0a%3c fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and%0a%3c that also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I also%0a%3c have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of%0a%3c their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they%0a%3c then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will I%0a%3c remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and%0a%3c also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the%0a%3c land.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her%0a%3c sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept%0a%3c of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they%0a%3c despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,%0a%3c I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them%0a%3c utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their%0a%3c God.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their%0a%3c ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight%0a%3c of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD%0a%3c made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand%0a%3c of Moses.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the%0a%3c children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a%0a%3c singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old%0a%3c even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels%0a%3c of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty%0a%3c shekels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then%0a%3c thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female%0a%3c ten shekels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy%0a%3c estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the%0a%3c female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,%0a%3c then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten%0a%3c shekels.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present%0a%3c himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according%0a%3c to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the%0a%3c LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad%0a%3c for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and%0a%3c the exchange thereof shall be holy.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a%0a%3c sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the%0a%3c priest: 27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or%0a%3c bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part%0a%3c thereof unto thy estimation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the%0a%3c LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as%0a%3c the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he%0a%3c shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and%0a%3c it shall be his.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field%0a%3c of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed%0a%3c thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of%0a%3c silver.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to%0a%3c thy estimation it shall stand.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest%0a%3c shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,%0a%3c even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy%0a%3c estimation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,%0a%3c then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto%0a%3c it, and it shall be assured to him.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the%0a%3c field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy%0a%3c unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the%0a%3c priest's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath%0a%3c bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then the%0a%3c priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto%0a%3c the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that%0a%3c day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of%0a%3c whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did%0a%3c belong.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the%0a%3c sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's%0a%3c firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is%0a%3c the LORD's.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it%0a%3c according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it%0a%3c thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to%0a%3c thy estimation.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto%0a%3c the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field%0a%3c of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is%0a%3c most holy unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;%0a%3c but shall surely be put to death.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,%0a%3c or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall%0a%3c add thereto the fifth part thereof.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of%0a%3c whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the%0a%3c LORD.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he%0a%3c change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change%0a%3c thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.%0a%3c %0a%3c 27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for%0a%3c the children of Israel in mount Sinai.%0a%3c %0a
