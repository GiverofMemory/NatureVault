With  the %0aarmy  in  Germany  he  acquired  distinction.  On  his %0areturn  to  Rome  he  was  enrolled  in  the  College  of %0aAugurs  —  a  post  which  favoured  his  philosophic  in- %0a%0a%0aVI  PREFACE. %0a%0aquiries  ;  and  he  was  subsequently  appointed  Procu- %0arator, or  Vice-Governor,  in  Spain. %0a%0aIt  has  been  remarked,  that  none  labour  more %0astrenuously  in  any  favourite  pursuit  than  those  whose %0atime  appears  absorbed  in  the  necessary  affairs  of  life  ; %0anone  are  so  idle  as  those  whose  business  is  slight %0aenough  to  afford  leisure  for  every  occupation.  Of  this %0atruth  history  furnishes  no  example  more  striking  than %0ais  visible  in  the  varied  pursuits,  the  diligence,  and  the %0aresearch  of  Pliny ;  while  there  can  be  no  doubt  also %0abut  that  his  public  services  acquired  additional  value %0afrom  the  wide  range  which  his  mind  embraced,  and %0athe  rich  stores  of  knowledge  which  it  was  his  habit  to %0aaccumulate  and  arrange. %0a%0aSuch  was  the  spirituality  of  his  nature,  that  bodily %0arequirements — much  more  bodily  indulgences — seemed %0aextinct  in  him.  His  relaxation  from  official  business %0awas  a  change  of  labour.  The  greater  portion  of  his %0anights  was  devoted  to  study ;  his  very  meals  were  an %0aabstraction  ;  for,  lest  he  should  forget  the  higher  aim %0aof  existence,  his  amanuensis  read  to  him  in  their  pro- %0agress ;  and,  instead  of  walking,  he  drove  in  the  cha- %0ariot —  his  secretary  beside  him  —  to  save  time  and %0aescape  distraction  from  his  contemplations.  So  nume- %0arous and  valued  were  his  extracts,  remarks,  and  an- %0anotations, that  Lartius  Lutinius  offered  the  philoso- %0apher a  sum  equivalent  to  more  than  three  thousand %0apounds  sterling  for  the  possession  of  them ;  but  they %0awere  more  nobly  bequeathed  to  his  beloved  and  distin- %0aguished nephew.  In  the  vast  realms  of  Nature  and %0aArt  no  object  was  indifferent  to  him  ;  in  the  province %0aof  the  Fine  Arts,  the  accuracy  of  his  judgment  and %0athe  fidelity  of  his  details  seemed  only  to  be  outmea- %0a%0a%0aPREFACE.  Vll %0a%0asured  by  the  extent  of  his  acquirement ;  and  as  a  his- %0atory, a  critique,  and  a  catalogue,  nothing  more  pre- %0acious in  letters  than  his  34th,  35th  and  36th  books, %0ahas  escaped  the  ruin  in  which  the  fall  of  the  Roman %0aempire  had  nearly  involved  all  of  enlightenment  that %0ahad  grown  up  and  flourished  with  it.  To  his  huma- %0anity and  scientific  curiosity  combined,  he  became  one %0aof  the  most  memorable  martyrs  that  stand  on  record. %0aThe  events  of  the  day  that  closed  his  mortal  career, %0ain  the  79th  year  of  the  Christian  era,  are  minutely  and %0atouchingly  detailed  to  Tacitus  the  historian,  in  one  of %0athe  most  elegant  of  the  epistles  penned  by  a  nephew %0awho  was  the  worthy  inheritor  of  the  wealth,  the  fame, %0aand  the  virtues  of  his  uncle.  The  body  was  found %0athree  days  after  its  destruction  by  the  eruptions  of %0aVesuvius,  and  interred  at  Misenum,  in  face  of  the  fleet %0awhich  he  had  quitted  for  the  prosecution  of  his  phy- %0asical investigations.  For  the  emulation  of  those  who %0adelight  to %0a%0a"  Look  from  nature  up  to  nature's  God," %0a%0aas  the  best  eulogy  that  can  be  pronounced  on  Pliny %0ahimself,  and,  at  the  same  time,  as  a  sentiment  evincing %0ahis  nephew's  exalted  mind,  the  subjoined  extract  of %0athe  memorable  letter  cannot  be  too  often  and  too  long %0aremembered  :  —  "  Equidem  beatos  puto,  quibus  Deo- %0arum  datum  est,  aut  facere  scribenda,  aut  scribere %0alegenda ;  beatissimos  vero  quibus  utrumque." %0a%0aNo  impulse  short  of  an  intense  love  of  nature %0acould  have  actuated  a  man  so  deeply  engaged  in  the %0ahigh  offices  of  the  state  to  snatch  at  every  fragment  of %0ahis  time  —  as  his  nephew,  in  a  letter  to  a  friend,  de- %0ascribes him  —  and  appropriate  it  to  forming  a  digest  of %0a%0a%0aVlll  PREFACE. %0a%0athe  scattered  rays  of  natural  knowledge.  The  subject %0awas  scarcely  popular  with  his  countrymen  ;  and  its %0amaterials  were  to  he  sifted  from  Greek  writers  of %0aevery  school,  with  a  toil  and  patience  which  few  can %0aduly  estimate.  The  abstracts  thus  made  filled  one %0ahundred  and  sixty  closely  written  volumes,  and  though %0athe  sentiments,  or,  as  we  should  now  term  them,  the %0atheories,  of  his  authors  were  not  a  little  discordant,  he %0awas  well  able  to  separate  their  matter  from  their %0aopinions  ;  and,  if  sometimes  found  to  have  hastily %0aadopted  hypotheses  for  facts,  it  must  be  remembered %0athat  there  existed  then  no  standard  for  the  test  of %0afact — that  what  he  had  abstracted  had  the  sanction  of %0avenerable  names — and  that  the  period  of  sound  criticism %0acomes  in  only  when  vast  stores  of  facts  and  incidents %0ahave  been  collected  ;  and  Pliny  was  then  the  most  dili- %0agent accumulator  for  a  riper  age.  To  him  belongs %0athe  glory  of  having  harvested  the  materials  for  future %0ascience.  Where  attempts  at  explanation  were  made, %0aoccult  causes,  in  the  ignorance  of  experiment,  were %0athe  only  resource ;  and  even  the  great  Galileo  took %0arefuge  in  "  Nature's  abhorrence  of  a  vacuum,"  for  the %0aonly  solution  he  could  give  of  an  operation  which  now %0aadmits  of  such  rational  explanation.  Even  the  errors %0aof  these  authors  are  a  portion  of  the  "  History  of %0aNature,"  and  Pliny's  record  of  them  becomes  valuable, %0awhere  otherwise  his  narrative  tempts  only  to  a  smile. %0a%0aThe  light  of  modern  science  clears  away  the  mist ; %0ayet  few,  even  of  ourselves,  are  privileged,  from  our %0ahigher  sphere  of  advancement,  to  look  down  con- %0atemptuously on  the  erroneous  conjectures  or  super- %0astitious feelings  exemplified  in  this  cyclopaedia  of  the %0aRoman  naturalist :  for  too  many  such  failings  are  still %0a%0a%0aPREFACE.  IX %0a%0avisible  amongst  ourselves,  and  these  from  a  wrong  and %0asometimes  cherished  bias  in  us,  which  were  only  an %0ainability  to  penetrate  more  deeply  in  themselves. %0a%0aTo  Pliny's  especial  honour  be  it  mentioned  (and %0ainstances  of  the  merit  will  be  frequently  referred  to  in %0athe  notes),  wherever  a  rational  explanation  of  natural %0aappearances  can  be  given,  he  uniformly  prefers  it  to %0athe  traditionary  and  the  vulgar,  however  the  latter  may %0ahave  been  interwoven  with  the  religion  of  the  state,  to %0awhich,  on  other  occasions,  he  paid  the  homage  which %0ait  required :  a  practice  like  this  demanded  no  ordinary %0acourage,  when  it  might  easily  have  provoked  the %0acharge  of  scepticism  and  profanity  ;  and  his  escape %0afrom  this  may  not,  perhaps,  unreasonably  be  traced  to %0athe  support  he  obtained  for  his  remarks  from  Greek %0aauthors,  to  whom,  in  points  of  speculation,  the  Romans %0apeculiarly  deferred. %0a%0aBy  many  it  was  feared,  that  if  what  the  people %0awere  accustomed  to  worship  as  deities  were  shewn  to %0atheir  understandings  as  only  natural  influences,  they %0amight  sink  into  atheism,  and  the  little  restraint  winch %0athis  worship  exercised  over  their  morals  have  been  en- %0atirely dissipated.  The  Rationalism  of  the  philosophers %0athus  appeared  a  formidable  evil ;  and  the  prevalence  of %0athe  notion  that  certain  remarkable  natural  causes  pro- %0aductive of  great  good  or  great  evil,  according  to  our %0alimited  judgment,  were  deities  themselves,  is  amply %0aillustrated  by  the  fact,  that  it  was  triumphantly  asked %0aof  the  first  Christians  to  shew  their  God ;  and  much %0aof  the  contempt,  persecution,  and  reproach  of  atheism %0athey  incurred,  may  have  had  its  origin  in  this  seeming %0aincapacity  to  conform  to  this  demand. %0a%0aTo  modern  eyes,  Pliny's  mode  of  conducting  his %0a%0a%0aX  PREFACE. %0a%0ainvestigations  has  changed  its  aspect ;  and  his  credu- %0ality is  gravely  urged  against  him  as  a  crime  which  his %0aexposure  of  much  error  and  superstition  is  not  thought %0asufficient  to  outweigh.  Some  of  the  matters  which  he %0aannounces,  it  is  true,  might  well  have  shaken  the %0astrongest  tendency  to  belief :  and  Herodotus,  when  re- %0aporting similar  occurrences  which  had  been  narrated %0ato  him,  is  known  to  have  carefully  separated  between %0awhat  was  given  on  the  authority  of  others,  and  on  his %0aown  responsibility.  On  the  other  hand,  it  must  be %0aborne  in  mind,  that  a  proneness  to  belief  in  the  case  of %0anatural  wonders  was  the  feature  -of  the  age ;  and  had %0athese  been  omitted,  the  author  would  have  incurred %0acensure  on  this  ground  —  an  accusation,  the  reverse, %0adoubtless,  of  what  is  now  advanced,  but  which  would, %0anevertheless,  have  affected  his  character  for  fidelity. %0a%0aThere  is,  moreover,  reason  to  believe  that  he  has %0asoftened  down  much  of  the  wonderful  which  he  ex- %0atracted from  other  authors,  and  the  following  coinci- %0adence may  be  regarded  as  giving  confirmation  to  this %0aestimate  of  Pliny's  discretion.  When  Aulus  Gellius %0alanded  at  Brundusium,  on  his  passage  from  Athens  to %0aRome,  he  found  on  the  book-stalls  some  bundles  of %0aGreek  works,  which  he  read  with  eager  curiosity.  But, %0awith  every  disposition  to  credit  the  authorities,  he  calls %0asome  of  the  narratives  of  Aristeas,  Isigonius,  Ctesias, %0aOnesicritus,  Polystephanus,  and  Hegesias,  unheard %0aof  and  incredible.  Accordingly,  in  making  extracts %0afrom  these  volumes,  which  bore  marks  of  having  been %0amuch  read,  it  would  appear  that  he  passed  by  those %0aincidents  which  were  most  absurd,  and  selected  such %0aonly  as  he  deemed  worthy  of  further  inquiry.  The %0aselections  thus  made  are  found  remarkably  to  corre- %0a%0a%0aPREFACE.  XI %0a%0aspond  with  those  which  Pliny  has  introduced  in  his %0aown  work. %0a%0aNarratives  of  similar  stamp  and  character  gained %0aequal  credit  in  Europe  during  the  middle  ages :  the %0afamous  traveller,  Maundeville,  believed  what  he  nar- %0arated, and  found,  as  he  expected,  readers  ready  to  be- %0alieve him ;  and  the  more  so,  perhaps,  for  the  marvels %0awhich  the  history  of  his  tour  contains.  Indeed,  in  the %0ainfancy  of  observation,  when  the  Causes  of  Natural %0aPhenomena  were  little  known,  so  much  was  seen  as  to %0arender  every  thing  probable,  and  so  little  understood, %0athat  any  explanation  was  alike  satisfactory. %0a%0aRapid  as  is  the  foregoing  sketch  of  the  great  natu- %0aralist's life  and  character,  enough,  it  is  hoped,  has  been %0aglanced  at  to  commend  the  revival  of  the  volume  be- %0afore us,  and  to  secure  for  its  author  among  ourselves  a %0areverence  as  great  as  is  the  undying  interest  given  by %0ahis  name  to  the  cities  of  Herculaneum  and  Pompeii, %0awhich  perished  with  him. %0a%0aThe  following  translation  may  be  regarded  as  that %0aof  Dr.  Philemon  Holland,  who  flourished  in  the  reign %0aof  Elizabeth,  and  is  the  only  writer  who  has  given  a %0acomplete  rendering  of  Pliny's  works  in  English.  Some %0aliberties  have  been  taken  with  the  original  translation. %0aAn  attempt  has  been  made  to  reduce  its  verbosity,  and %0ato  approximate  it  more  closely  to  the  brevity  and  terse- %0aness of  the  Latin  text ;  while  the  Editor  has  been  at %0athe  same  time  studious  of  not  interfering  unnecessarily %0awith  the  simplicity  of  style  by  which  writers  of  that  day %0awere  distinguished.  The  notes  are  given  by  various %0amembers  of  the  Club,  to  whom  application  has  been %0aseverally  made  by  the  general  Editor,  according  to %0athe  department  in  which  each  may  be  found  most %0a%0a%0aXll %0a%0a%0aPREFACE. %0a%0a%0acompetent.  The  contributions  have  received  the %0aapproval  of  the  Committee,  and  been  specially  ac- %0aknowledged in  each  volume. %0a%0aThe  first  and  thirty-third  books  of  Pliny  were %0atranslated  by  Dr.  Bostock  in  1828,  as  specimens  of %0aa  new  version,  which,  but  for  his  death,  would  in  all %0aprobability  have  been  completed.  Of  the  notes  ap- %0apended to  these  sample  chapters,  such  use  has  been %0amade  as  subserves  the  purposes  of  our  republishing %0aPliny  in  English  ;  but,  in  the  main,  they  are  found  to %0abe  more  critical  than  explanatory. %0a%0a%0aSSternerfan %0a%0a%0aBone  Ticket  of  Admission  to  the  Amphitheatre,  found  at  Pompeii

On  his %0a%3c return  to  Rome  he  was  enrolled  in  the  College  of %0a%3c Augurs  —  a  post  which  favoured  his  philosophic  in- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VI  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c quiries  ;  and  he  was  subsequently  appointed  Procu- %0a%3c rator, or  Vice-Governor,  in  Spain. %0a%3c %0a%3c It  has  been  remarked,  that  none  labour  more %0a%3c strenuously  in  any  favourite  pursuit  than  those  whose %0a%3c time  appears  absorbed  in  the  necessary  affairs  of  life  ; %0a%3c none  are  so  idle  as  those  whose  business  is  slight %0a%3c enough  to  afford  leisure  for  every  occupation.  Of  this %0a%3c truth  history  furnishes  no  example  more  striking  than %0a%3c is  visible  in  the  varied  pursuits,  the  diligence,  and  the %0a%3c research  of  Pliny ;  while  there  can  be  no  doubt  also %0a%3c but  that  his  public  services  acquired  additional  value %0a%3c from  the  wide  range  which  his  mind  embraced,  and %0a%3c the  rich  stores  of  knowledge  which  it  was  his  habit  to %0a%3c accumulate  and  arrange. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such  was  the  spirituality  of  his  nature,  that  bodily %0a%3c requirements — much  more  bodily  indulgences — seemed %0a%3c extinct  in  him.  His  relaxation  from  official  business %0a%3c was  a  change  of  labour.  The  greater  portion  of  his %0a%3c nights  was  devoted  to  study ;  his  very  meals  were  an %0a%3c abstraction  ;  for,  lest  he  should  forget  the  higher  aim %0a%3c of  existence,  his  amanuensis  read  to  him  in  their  pro- %0a%3c gress ;  and,  instead  of  walking,  he  drove  in  the  cha- %0a%3c riot —  his  secretary  beside  him  —  to  save  time  and %0a%3c escape  distraction  from  his  contemplations.

Vll %0a%3c %0a%3c sured  by  the  extent  of  his  acquirement ;  and  as  a  his- %0a%3c tory, a  critique,  and  a  catalogue,  nothing  more  pre- %0a%3c cious in  letters  than  his  34th,  35th  and  36th  books, %0a%3c has  escaped  the  ruin  in  which  the  fall  of  the  Roman %0a%3c empire  had  nearly  involved  all  of  enlightenment  that %0a%3c had  grown  up  and  flourished  with  it.  To  his  huma- %0a%3c nity and  scientific  curiosity  combined,  he  became  one %0a%3c of  the  most  memorable  martyrs  that  stand  on  record. %0a%3c The  events  of  the  day  that  closed  his  mortal  career, %0a%3c in  the  79th  year  of  the  Christian  era,  are  minutely  and %0a%3c touchingly  detailed  to  Tacitus  the  historian,  in  one  of %0a%3c the  most  elegant  of  the  epistles  penned  by  a  nephew %0a%3c who  was  the  worthy  inheritor  of  the  wealth,  the  fame, %0a%3c and  the  virtues  of  his  uncle.  The  body  was  found %0a%3c three  days  after  its  destruction  by  the  eruptions  of %0a%3c Vesuvius,  and  interred  at  Misenum,  in  face  of  the  fleet %0a%3c which  he  had  quitted  for  the  prosecution  of  his  phy- %0a%3c sical investigations.  For  the  emulation  of  those  who %0a%3c delight  to %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Look  from  nature  up  to  nature's  God," %0a%3c %0a%3c as  the  best  eulogy  that  can  be  pronounced  on  Pliny %0a%3c himself,  and,  at  the  same  time,  as  a  sentiment  evincing %0a%3c his  nephew's  exalted  mind,  the  subjoined  extract  of %0a%3c the  memorable  letter  cannot  be  too  often  and  too  long %0a%3c remembered  :  —  "  Equidem  beatos  puto,  quibus  Deo- %0a%3c rum  datum  est,  aut  facere  scribenda,  aut  scribere %0a%3c legenda ;  beatissimos  vero  quibus  utrumque." %0a%3c %0a%3c No  impulse  short  of  an  intense  love  of  nature %0a%3c could  have  actuated  a  man  so  deeply  engaged  in  the %0a%3c high  offices  of  the  state  to  snatch  at  every  fragment  of %0a%3c his  time  —  as  his  nephew,  in  a  letter  to  a  friend,  de- %0a%3c scribes him  —  and  appropriate  it  to  forming  a  digest  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vlll  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c the  scattered  rays  of  natural  knowledge.  The  subject %0a%3c was  scarcely  popular  with  his  countrymen  ;  and  its %0a%3c materials  were  to  he  sifted  from  Greek  writers  of %0a%3c every  school,  with  a  toil  and  patience  which  few  can %0a%3c duly  estimate.  The  abstracts  thus  made  filled  one %0a%3c hundred  and  sixty  closely  written  volumes,  and  though %0a%3c the  sentiments,  or,  as  we  should  now  term  them,  the %0a%3c theories,  of  his  authors  were  not  a  little  discordant,  he %0a%3c was  well  able  to  separate  their  matter  from  their %0a%3c opinions  ;  and,  if  sometimes  found  to  have  hastily %0a%3c adopted  hypotheses  for  facts,  it  must  be  remembered %0a%3c that  there  existed  then  no  standard  for  the  test  of %0a%3c fact — that  what  he  had  abstracted  had  the  sanction  of %0a%3c venerable  names — and  that  the  period  of  sound  criticism %0a%3c comes  in  only  when  vast  stores  of  facts  and  incidents %0a%3c have  been  collected  ;  and  Pliny  was  then  the  most  dili- %0a%3c gent accumulator  for  a  riper  age.  To  him  belongs %0a%3c the  glory  of  having  harvested  the  materials  for  future %0a%3c science.  Where  attempts  at  explanation  were  made, %0a%3c occult  causes,  in  the  ignorance  of  experiment,  were %0a%3c the  only  resource ;  and  even  the  great  Galileo  took %0a%3c refuge  in  "  Nature's  abhorrence  of  a  vacuum,"  for  the %0a%3c only  solution  he  could  give  of  an  operation  which  now %0a%3c admits  of  such  rational  explanation.  Even  the  errors %0a%3c of  these  authors  are  a  portion  of  the  "  History  of %0a%3c Nature,"  and  Pliny's  record  of  them  becomes  valuable, %0a%3c where  otherwise  his  narrative  tempts  only  to  a  smile. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  light  of  modern  science  clears  away  the  mist ; %0a%3c yet  few,  even  of  ourselves,  are  privileged,  from  our %0a%3c higher  sphere  of  advancement,  to  look  down  con- %0a%3c temptuously on  the  erroneous  conjectures  or  super- %0a%3c stitious feelings  exemplified  in  this  cyclopaedia  of  the %0a%3c Roman  naturalist :  for  too  many  such  failings  are  still %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PREFACE.  IX %0a%3c %0a%3c visible  amongst  ourselves,  and  these  from  a  wrong  and %0a%3c sometimes  cherished  bias  in  us,  which  were  only  an %0a%3c inability  to  penetrate  more  deeply  in  themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  Pliny's  especial  honour  be  it  mentioned  (and %0a%3c instances  of  the  merit  will  be  frequently  referred  to  in %0a%3c the  notes),  wherever  a  rational  explanation  of  natural %0a%3c appearances  can  be  given,  he  uniformly  prefers  it  to %0a%3c the  traditionary  and  the  vulgar,  however  the  latter  may %0a%3c have  been  interwoven  with  the  religion  of  the  state,  to %0a%3c which,  on  other  occasions,  he  paid  the  homage  which %0a%3c it  required :  a  practice  like  this  demanded  no  ordinary %0a%3c courage,  when  it  might  easily  have  provoked  the %0a%3c charge  of  scepticism  and  profanity  ;  and  his  escape %0a%3c from  this  may  not,  perhaps,  unreasonably  be  traced  to %0a%3c the  support  he  obtained  for  his  remarks  from  Greek %0a%3c authors,  to  whom,  in  points  of  speculation,  the  Romans %0a%3c peculiarly  deferred. %0a%3c %0a%3c By  many  it  was  feared,  that  if  what  the  people %0a%3c were  accustomed  to  worship  as  deities  were  shewn  to %0a%3c their  understandings  as  only  natural  influences,  they %0a%3c might  sink  into  atheism,  and  the  little  restraint  winch %0a%3c this  worship  exercised  over  their  morals  have  been  en- %0a%3c tirely dissipated.  The  Rationalism  of  the  philosophers %0a%3c thus  appeared  a  formidable  evil ;  and  the  prevalence  of %0a%3c the  notion  that  certain  remarkable  natural  causes  pro- %0a%3c ductive of  great  good  or  great  evil,  according  to  our %0a%3c limited  judgment,  were  deities  themselves,  is  amply %0a%3c illustrated  by  the  fact,  that  it  was  triumphantly  asked %0a%3c of  the  first  Christians  to  shew  their  God ;  and  much %0a%3c of  the  contempt,  persecution,  and  reproach  of  atheism %0a%3c they  incurred,  may  have  had  its  origin  in  this  seeming %0a%3c incapacity  to  conform  to  this  demand. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  modern  eyes,  Pliny's  mode  of  conducting  his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c X  PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c investigations  has  changed  its  aspect ;  and  his  credu- %0a%3c lity is  gravely  urged  against  him  as  a  crime  which  his %0a%3c exposure  of  much  error  and  superstition  is  not  thought %0a%3c sufficient  to  outweigh.  Some  of  the  matters  which  he %0a%3c announces,  it  is  true,  might  well  have  shaken  the %0a%3c strongest  tendency  to  belief :  and  Herodotus,  when  re- %0a%3c porting similar  occurrences  which  had  been  narrated %0a%3c to  him,  is  known  to  have  carefully  separated  between %0a%3c what  was  given  on  the  authority  of  others,  and  on  his %0a%3c own  responsibility.  On  the  other  hand,  it  must  be %0a%3c borne  in  mind,  that  a  proneness  to  belief  in  the  case  of %0a%3c natural  wonders  was  the  feature  -of  the  age ;  and  had %0a%3c these  been  omitted,  the  author  would  have  incurred %0a%3c censure  on  this  ground  —  an  accusation,  the  reverse, %0a%3c doubtless,  of  what  is  now  advanced,  but  which  would, %0a%3c nevertheless,  have  affected  his  character  for  fidelity. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  is,  moreover,  reason  to  believe  that  he  has %0a%3c softened  down  much  of  the  wonderful  which  he  ex- %0a%3c tracted from  other  authors,  and  the  following  coinci- %0a%3c dence may  be  regarded  as  giving  confirmation  to  this %0a%3c estimate  of  Pliny's  discretion.  When  Aulus  Gellius %0a%3c landed  at  Brundusium,  on  his  passage  from  Athens  to %0a%3c Rome,  he  found  on  the  book-stalls  some  bundles  of %0a%3c Greek  works,  which  he  read  with  eager  curiosity.  But, %0a%3c with  every  disposition  to  credit  the  authorities,  he  calls %0a%3c some  of  the  narratives  of  Aristeas,  Isigonius,  Ctesias, %0a%3c Onesicritus,  Polystephanus,  and  Hegesias,  unheard %0a%3c of  and  incredible.  Accordingly,  in  making  extracts %0a%3c from  these  volumes,  which  bore  marks  of  having  been %0a%3c much  read,  it  would  appear  that  he  passed  by  those %0a%3c incidents  which  were  most  absurd,  and  selected  such %0a%3c only  as  he  deemed  worthy  of  further  inquiry.  The %0a%3c selections  thus  made  are  found  remarkably  to  corre- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PREFACE.  XI %0a%3c %0a%3c spond  with  those  which  Pliny  has  introduced  in  his %0a%3c own  work. %0a%3c %0a%3c Narratives  of  similar  stamp  and  character  gained %0a%3c equal  credit  in  Europe  during  the  middle  ages :  the %0a%3c famous  traveller,  Maundeville,  believed  what  he  nar- %0a%3c rated, and  found,  as  he  expected,  readers  ready  to  be- %0a%3c lieve him ;  and  the  more  so,  perhaps,  for  the  marvels %0a%3c which  the  history  of  his  tour  contains.  Indeed,  in  the %0a%3c infancy  of  observation,  when  the  Causes  of  Natural %0a%3c Phenomena  were  little  known,  so  much  was  seen  as  to %0a%3c render  every  thing  probable,  and  so  little  understood, %0a%3c that  any  explanation  was  alike  satisfactory. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rapid  as  is  the  foregoing  sketch  of  the  great  natu- %0a%3c ralist's life  and  character,  enough,  it  is  hoped,  has  been %0a%3c glanced  at  to  commend  the  revival  of  the  volume  be- %0a%3c fore us,  and  to  secure  for  its  author  among  ourselves  a %0a%3c reverence  as  great  as  is  the  undying  interest  given  by %0a%3c his  name  to  the  cities  of  Herculaneum  and  Pompeii, %0a%3c which  perished  with  him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  following  translation  may  be  regarded  as  that %0a%3c of  Dr.  Philemon  Holland,  who  flourished  in  the  reign %0a%3c of  Elizabeth,  and  is  the  only  writer  who  has  given  a %0a%3c complete  rendering  of  Pliny's  works  in  English.  Some %0a%3c liberties  have  been  taken  with  the  original  translation. %0a%3c An  attempt  has  been  made  to  reduce  its  verbosity,  and %0a%3c to  approximate  it  more  closely  to  the  brevity  and  terse- %0a%3c ness of  the  Latin  text ;  while  the  Editor  has  been  at %0a%3c the  same  time  studious  of  not  interfering  unnecessarily %0a%3c with  the  simplicity  of  style  by  which  writers  of  that  day %0a%3c were  distinguished.  The  notes  are  given  by  various %0a%3c members  of  the  Club,  to  whom  application  has  been %0a%3c severally  made  by  the  general  Editor,  according  to %0a%3c the  department  in  which  each  may  be  found  most %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Xll %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PREFACE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c competent.  The  contributions  have  received  the %0a%3c approval  of  the  Committee,  and  been  specially  ac- %0a%3c knowledged in  each  volume. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  first  and  thirty-third  books  of  Pliny  were %0a%3c translated  by  Dr.  Bostock  in  1828,  as  specimens  of %0a%3c a  new  version,  which,  but  for  his  death,  would  in  all %0a%3c probability  have  been  completed.  Of  the  notes  ap- %0a%3c pended to  these  sample  chapters,  such  use  has  been %0a%3c made  as  subserves  the  purposes  of  our  republishing %0a%3c Pliny  in  English  ;  but,  in  the  main,  they  are  found  to %0a%3c be  more  critical  than  explanatory. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SSternerfan %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bone  Ticket  of  Admission  to  the  Amphitheatre,  found  at  Pompeii %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
