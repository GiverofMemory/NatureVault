PLINIUS   SECUNDUS. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  I. %0aWhether  the  World  be  finite,  and  but  one. %0a%0aHE  World1,  and  that  which,  by  another  Name. %0aMen  have  thought  Good  to  call  Heaven %0a(under  the  Compass  of  which  all  Things  are %0acovered),  we  ought  to  believe,  in  all  Reason,  to %0abe  a  Divine  Power,  eternal,  immense,  without %0aBeginning,  and  never  to  perish.  What  is  beyond  the  Compass %0a%0a1  The  Author  manifests  a  philosophic,  as  well  as  pious  spirit,  in  begin- %0aning his  work  with  a  reference  to  Divine  power ;  but  in  giving  this  idea %0aof  the  nature  of  the  world,  and  representing  it  as  a  separate  and  inde- %0apendent divinity,  he  adopts  an  ancient  speculative  opinion  derived  from  the %0aOriental  philosophy,  in  preference  to  the  popular  opinion  of  his  country, %0awhich  is  selected  by  Ovid  in  his  Introduction  to  the  "  Metamorphoses;"  and %0awhich  ascribed  the  creation  of  the  world  to  an  already  existing  or  eternal %0aGod  —  "  whichever  God  he  was :"  though  not  to  the  highest  in  rank  of  the %0aHeathen  Mythology ;  for  the  latter  is  represented  as  descended  from  pre- %0aviously existing,  or  humanly  deified,  parents,  and  consequently  was  of  a %0asubsequent  age.

[ BOOK  II. %0a%0athereof,  neither  is  it  fit  for  Men  to  search,  nor  within  Man's %0aUnderstanding  to  conceive.  Sacred  it  is,  everlasting,  infi- %0anite, all  in  all,  or  rather  itself  all  and  absolute  :  limited,  yet %0aseeming  infinite  :  in  all  Motions,  certain ;  though  in  Appear- %0aance uncertain  :  comprehending  in  itself  all  both  without %0aand  within  :  Nature's  Work,  and  yet  very  Nature  itself.  It %0ais  Madness  that  some  have  thought  in  their  Mind  to  mea- %0asure it ;  yea,  and  durst  in  Writing  set  down  the  Dimensions %0athereof:  that  others  again,  by  Occasion  hereupon  taken, %0aor  on  this  founded,  have  taught,  That  there  are  Worlds  in- %0ato slip  from  the  minds  of  learned  Heathens,  through  their  speculations %0ainto  occult  causes,  and  the  wrapping  up  of  religion  from  the  inquiries  of %0athe  vulgar,  as  being  too  high  for  their  comprehension,  they  were  led  to %0athe  conception  of  what,  in  fact,  was  no  more  than  a  mere  abstraction,  and %0adestitute  of  all  proper  personality :  a  simple,  unconscious  fatality,  with %0alittle  volition :  and,  in  truth,  no  better  than  a  diffusive  aether,  or,  as  it %0awould  now  be  denominated,  galvanic  influence.  The  philosophy  of %0aPythagoras  was  derived  from  the  East;  "But  it  was  this,"  says  Lord %0aBacon  ("  Natural  History,"  10th  century),  "  which  did  first  plant  a  mon- %0astrous imagination,  which  afterwards  was,  by  the  school  of  Plato  and %0aothers,  watered  and  nourished.  It  was,  that  the  world  was  one,  entire, %0aperfect,  living  creature  ;  insomuch  as  Apollonius  of  Tyana,  a  Pythagorean %0aprophet,  affirmed  that  the  ebbing  and  flowing  of  the  sea  was  the  respira- %0ation of  the  world,  drawing  in  water  as  breath,  and  putting  it  forth  again. %0aThey  went  on,  and  inferred,  that  if  the  world  were  a  living  creature,  it %0ahad  a  soul  and  spirit ;  which  also  they  held,  calling  it '  spiritus  mundij  the %0aspirit  or  soul  of  the  world.  By  which  they  did  not  intend  God  (for  they %0adid  admit  of  a  deity  besides),  but  only  the  soul,  or  essential  form,  of  the %0auniverse.  This  foundation  being  laid,  they  might  build  upon  it  what %0athey  would;  for  in  a  living  creature,  though  never  so  great  (as,  for %0aexample,  in  a  great  whale),  the  sense  and  the  effects  of  any  one  part  of %0athe  body  instantly  make  a  transcursion  throughout  the  whole  body.  So %0athat  by  this  they  did  insinuate,  that  no  distance  of  place,  nor  want  nor %0aindisposition  of  matter,  could  hinder  magical  operations ;  but  that,  for %0aexample,  we  mought  here  in  Europe  have  sense  and  feeling  of  that  which %0awas  done  in  China ;  and  likewise  we  mought  work  any  effect  without  and %0aagainst  matter;  and  this  not  holden  by  the  co-operation  of  angels  or %0aspirits,  but  only  by  the  unity  and  harmony  of  nature."  This  was  the %0aoccult  cause,  to  which  all  the  otherwise  unaccountable  operations  of %0anature  might  easily  be  referred.  We  have  a  curious  instance  of  such  a %0amethod  of  explanation  at  the  end  of  the  ninety-third  chapter  of  this  book. %0a—  Wern.Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  3 1 %0a%0anumerable :  as  if  we  are  to  believe  so  many  Natures  as  there %0aare  Heavens :  or  if  all  were  reduced  to  one,  yet  there  should %0abe  so  many  Suns  and  Moons,  with  the  Rest  also  of  those %0aimmeasurable  and  innumerable  Stars  in  that  one :  as  though %0ain  this  plurality  of  Worlds  we  should  not  always  meet  with %0athe  same  Question  still  at  every  Turn  of  our  Thought,  for %0aWant  of  some  End  to  rest  upon  :  or,  if  this  infiniteness  could %0apossibly  be  assigned  to  Nature,  the  Work-mistress  of  all ; %0athe  same  might  not  be  understood  more  easily  in  that  one %0aHeaven  which  we  see  ;  so  great  a  Work  as  it  is.  Now  surely %0ait  is  more  than  Madness  to  quit  this,  and  to  keep  seeking %0awithout,  as  if  all  Things  within  were  well  and  clearly  known %0aalready :  as  if  any  Man  could  take  the  Measure  of  another %0aThing,  who  knoweth  not  his  own :  or  the  Mind  of  Man %0amight  see  those  Things  which  the  World  itself  may  not %0areceive. %0a%0aCHAPTER  II. %0aOf  the  Figure  of  the  World. %0a%0aTHAT  the  Form  of  the  World  is  round1,  in  the  Figure  of %0aa  perfect  Globe,  its  Name  in  the  first  Place,  and  the  Consent %0aof  all  Men  agreeing  to  call  it  in  Latin  Orbis  (a  Globe),  as %0aalso  many  natural  Reasons,  evidently  shew.  For  not  only %0abecause  such  a  Figure  every  Way  falleth  and  bendeth  upon %0aitself,  is  able  to  uphold  itself,  includeth  and  containeth  itself, %0ahaving  need  of  no  joints  for  this  purpose,  as  finding  in  any %0aPart  thereof  no  End  or  Beginning :  or  because  this  Form %0aagreeth  best  to  that  Motion,  whereby  continually  it  must %0aturn  about  (as  hereafter  will  appear) :  but  also  because  the %0aEyesight  doth  approve  the  same ;  because,  look  which  Way %0asoever  you  will,  it  appeareth  convex,  and  even  on  all  sides; %0aa  Thing  not  incident  to  any  other  Figure. %0a%0a1  That  it  was  an  oblate  spheroid,  flattened  at  the  poles,  was  little %0alikely  to  be  known  by  observers,  however  acute,  whose  opinion  of  the %0auninhabitable  nature  of  the  frigid  and  torrid  zones  would  lead  them  to %0alimit  their  practical  inquiries  to  the  temperate.  The  good  sense  of  Pliny %0ainduced  him  to  prefer  the  opinion  of  the  rotundity  of  the  globe,  to  that  of %0aEpicurus,  that  it  was  an  extended  plane. —  Wern.

[^OOK  **• %0a%0aCHAPTER  III. %0aThe  Motion  of  the  World. %0a%0aTHAT  the  World  thus  framed,  in  a  continued  Circuit, %0awith  unspeakable  Swiftness  turneth  round  in  the  Space  of %0afour-and-twenty  Hours,  the  ordinary  Rising  and  Setting  of %0athe  Sun  leaves  no  Room  to  doubt.  Whether  it  being  in %0aHeight  exceedingly  great,  and  therefore  the  Sound  of  so %0ahuge  a  Frame,  whilst  it  is  whirled  about  unceasingly,  cannot %0abe  heard  with  our  Ears,  I  cannot  easily  imagine  :  no  more, %0aby  Hercules !  than  1  may  vouch  the  Ringing  of  the  Stars  that %0aare  driven  round  therewith,  and  roll  their  own  Spheres :  or %0adetermine,  that  as  the  Heaven  movetb,  it  represents  a  plea- %0asant and  incredibly  sweet  Harmony  :  although  to  us  within, %0aby  Day  and  Night,  it  seemeth  to  roll  on  in  Silence.  That %0athere  is  imprinted  on  it  the  Figures  of  living  Creatures,  and %0aof  all  Kinds  of  Things  besides  without  Number,  as  also  that %0athe  Body  thereof  is  not  all  over  smooth  and  slippery  (as  we %0asee  in  Birds'  Eggs),  which  excellent  Authors  have  termed %0aTenerum,  is  shewn  by  Arguments ;  for  by  the  Fall  of  natural %0aSeeds  of  all  Things  from  thence,  and  those  for  the  most  Part %0amixed  one  with  another,  there  are  produced  in  the  World, %0aand  in  the  Sea  especially,  an  immense  Number  of  monstrous %0aShapes.  Besides  this,  our  Sight  testifieth  the  same  ;  for  in %0aone  Place  there  appeareth  the  Resemblance  of  a  Chariot,  in %0aanother  of  a  Bear,  or  a  Bull,  and  of  a  Letter  (A),  and  prin- %0acipally the  middle  Circle  over  our  Head,  where  it  is  more %0awhite  than  the  Rest. %0a%0aCHAPTER  IV. %0aWhy  the  World  is  called  Mundus. %0a%0aFOR  my  own  Part,  I  arn  ruled  by  the  general  Consent  of %0aall  Nations.  For,  the  World,  which  the  Greeks,  by  the %0aName  of  Ornament,  called  Ko%3cr/y,o$,  we,  for  the  perfect  Neat- %0aness and  absolute  Elegance  thereof,  have  termed  Mundus. %0aAnd  we  have  named  the  Sky  Calum,  because  it  is  engraven, %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  33 %0a%0aaccording  as  M.  Varro  interpreteth  it.  Arid  the  Order  of %0aThings  therein  contributes  to  this,  and  especially  the  defined %0aCircle  called  Signifer,  or  the  Zodiac,  divided  by  the  Forms %0aof  Twelve  living  Creatures,  through  which  is  the  Sun's  Track  ; %0apreserving  the  same  Course  for  so  many  Ages. %0a%0aCHAPTER  V. %0aOf  the  four  Elements l. %0a%0aI  SEE  no  doubt  regarding  the  Number  of  the  Elements, %0athat  they  are  four.  The  highest,  Fire  :  from  whence  are %0athose  bright  Eyes  of  so  many  shining  Stars.  The  next, %0aSpirit,  which  the  Greeks  and  our  Countrymen  by  one  Name %0acalled  Air :  this  Element  is  vital,  and  it  soon  passeth  through %0aall,  and  is  intrinsically  mixed  in  the  Whole :  by  the  Power %0awhereof,  the  Earth  hangeth  suspended  in  the  midst,  together %0awith  the  fourth  Element,  of  Water.  Thus,  by  a  mutual  em- %0abracing of  each  other,  divers  Natures  are  linked  together : %0aand  so  the  light  Elements  are  restrained  by  the  heavier,  that %0athey  do  not  fly  off:  and,  on  the  contrary,  the  massier  are %0aheld  up,  that  they  fall  not  down,  by  means  of  the  lighter, %0awhich  seek  to  mount  aloft.  So,  through  an  equal  Endeavour %0ato  the  Contrary,  each  of  them  holds  its  own,  bound  as  it %0awere  by  the  restless  Circuit  of  the  World  itself:  which,  run- %0aning evermore  upon  itself,  the  Earth  falleth  to  be  lowest, %0aand  in  the  Middle  of  the  Whole :  and  the  same  hanging %0asteadily  by  the  Pole  of  the  Universe,  poiseth  those  Ele- %0aments by  which  it  hangeth.  Thus  it  alone  resteth  un- %0amovable,  whilst  the  whole  Frame  of  the  World  turneth %0a%0a1  The  idea  here  conveyed  of  the  existence  of  four  elements,  which %0aenclose  each  other,  each  heavier  one  in  succession  subsiding  below  the %0aother,  is  more  fully  expressed  by  Ovid,  in  his  account  of  the  creation %0aof  the  world  at  the  beginning  of  the  first  book  of  his  "  Metamorphoses." %0aThe  opinion  was  generally  entertained,  of  these  elements  being  the  con- %0astituents of  all  things,  until  modern  chemical  analysis  demonstrated  that %0athemselves  are  compounded  of  other  and  more  simple  elements.  Yet %0athe  language  of  the  ancient  opinion  has  not  altogether  ceased  from  use, %0aeven  at  the  present  time. —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0aC %0a%0a%0a34  History  of  Nature.

In  the  midst  of  them  the  Sun  taketh  his %0aCourse,  as  being  the  greatest  and  most  powerful  of  all :  the %0avery  Ruler,  not  of  Times  and  Seasons  only,  and  of  the  Earth, %0abut  also  of  the  Stars  and  Sky  itself.  We  ought  to  believe %0athis  Sun1  to  be  the  very  Life  and  (to  speak  more  plainly)  the %0aSoul  of  the  whole  World,  and  the  principal  Governance  of %0aNature;  and,  considering  his  Operations,  nothing  less  than  a %0adivine  Power.  He  it  is  that  giveth  Light  to  all  Things,  and %0ascatters  their  Darkness  :  he  hideth  the  other  Stars  ;  he  or- %0adereth  the  Seasons  in  their  alternative  Course  ;  he  tempereth %0athe  Year,  which  ariseth  ever  fresh  again  for  the  Good  of  the %0aWorld.  He  disperseth  the  Sadness  of  the  Sky,  and  cleareth %0athe  Cloudiness  of  the  Mind  of  Man  ;  to  other  Stars,  likewise, %0ahe  lendeth  his  own  Light.  Most  excellent  and  glorious  he %0ais,  as  seeing  all,  and  hearing  all ;  as,  I  see,  is  the  Opinion  of %0aHomer*  (the  Prince  of  Learning)  regarding  him  alone. %0a%0a1  We  find  the  ascription  of  Divinity  to  be  the  last  resource  in  ex- %0aplaining the  operation  of  a  hidden  cause  in  nature.  A  false  divinity  was, %0atherefore,  the  foundation  of  errors  in  philosophy ;  and  the  latter  again %0areacted  on  the  former. — Wern.  Club. %0a%0a3  Pliny  here  refers  to  a  passage  in  the  eleventh  hook  of  the  "  Odys- %0asey," where  Ulysses  descends  into  Hell,  and  meets  with  Tiresias,  who,  in %0arecounting  the  future  fortunes  of  the  hero,  says :  "  You  shall  find  feeding %0athe  oxen  and  fat  sheep  of  the  sun,  who  sees  and  hears  all  things:"  or, %0amore  diffusively,  by  Pope  ;  where  — %0a%0au  Graze  numerous  herds  along  the  verdant  shores ; %0aThough  hunger  press,  yet  fly  the  dangerous  prey ; %0aThe  herds  are  sacred  to  the  god  of  day, %0aWho  all  surveys  with  his  extensive  eye, %0aAbove,  below,  on  earth  and  in  the  sky."

For  God,  whosoever  he  be  (if  haply  there  be  any  other, %0abut  the  World  itself),  and  in  what  Part  soever  resident,  all %0aSense  He  is,  all  Sight,  all  Hearing  :  He  is  the  whole  of  the  Life %0aand  of  the  Soul,  all  of  Himself.  And  to  believe  that  there  be %0aGods  innumerable,  and  those  according  to  Men's  Virtues  and %0aVices,  as  Chastity,  Concord,  Understanding,  Hope,  Honour, %0aClemency,  Faith  ;  or  (as  Democritus  was  of  Opinion)  that %0athere  are  two  Gods  only,  that  is,  Punishment  and  Benefit : %0athese  Conceits  render  Men's  idle  Negligence  the  greater.  But %0afrail  and  wearisome  mortal  Men,  remembering  their  own %0aInfirmity,  have  digested  these  Things  apart,  to  the  End  that %0aeach  one  might  from  thence  choose  to  worship  that  whereof %0ahe  stood  most  in  need.  And  hence  it  is,  that  in  different %0aNations  we  find  the  Gods  named  diversely  :  and  in  the  same %0aRegion  there  are  innumerable  Gods.  The  infernal  Powers, %0alikewise,  and  Diseases,  yea,  and  many  Plagues,  have  been %0aranged  in  Divisions,  and  reckoned  for  Gods ;  which,  with %0a%0a1  In  this  chapter  the  author  openly  asserts  his  disbelief  of  the  truth  of %0athe  established  system  of  religion  of  his  country ;  and  his  manner  of  doing %0athis  sufficiently  shews  the  confidence  he  felt,  of  finding  sympathy  in  his %0ascepticism  among  the  learned  and  refined  classes  of  society.  This  system %0awas,  indeed,  singularly  destitute  of  evidence ;  and  the  reasons  he  gives %0afor  his  disbelief  shew  it  to  have  been  as  absurd  to  the  eye  of  examination %0aas  it  was  unsupported  by  argument.  That  the  chief  deities  of  the  Hea- %0athen were  no  more  than  deceased  men  who  had  benefited  the  world  in %0atheir  lives,  or  at  least  acquired  human  respect,  is  asserted  by  many  other %0aancient  authors ;  but  it  is  to  be  regretted  that  the  author  should  so  far %0ajoin  in  the  error  as  from  it  to  find  occasion  for  thereby  mixing  up  with %0ait  the  flattery  of  a  court.  The  treatise  of  Cicero,  "  On  the  Nature  of  the %0aGods,"  and  the  remarks  of  Pliny,  are  proofs  that  the  ancient  Heathens %0awere  not  slow  to  discern  the  errors  of  the  popular  system  of  religion, %0athough  they  were  incapable  of  discovering  or  appreciating  the  true. — %0aWern.  Club. %0a%0a%0a36  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%0atrembling  Fear,  we  have  desired  to  pacify.  This  Superstition %0ahath  caused  a  Fane  to  be  dedicated  to  Fever,  in  the  Palatine %0aMount,  by  Order  of  the  State  ;  and  likewise  an  Altar  to %0aOrbona,  near  the  Temple  of  the  Lares:  besides  another %0aerected  to  Bad  Fortune  on  the  Esquiline.  By  this  it  may  be %0aconceived  that  there  are  a  greater  Number  of  Gods  in  Hea- %0aven than  of  Men  upon  Earth,  since  every  one  makes  as  many %0aGods  as  he  pleases,  fitting  himself  with  Junoes  and  Genii  for %0ahis  Patrons.  There  are  certain  Nations  that  account  Beasts, %0aand  even  some  filthy  Things,  for  Gods ;  yea,  and  many  other %0aMatters  more  shameful  to  be  spoken  :  swearing  by  stinking %0aMeats,  by  Garlic,  and  such-like.  But,  surely,  to  believe %0athat  Gods  have  contracted  Marriage,  and  that  in  so  long  a %0aTime  no  Children  should  be  born  to  them  :  also  that  some %0aare  aged,  and  ever  grey-headed :  others,  again,  young  and %0aalways  Children  :  that  they  be  black  of  Complexion,  winged, %0alame,  hatched  of  Eggs,  living  and  dying  on  each  alternate %0aDay ;  are  mere  childish  Fooleries.  But  it  exceedeth  all  Im- %0apudency  to  imagine  Adulteries  among  them :  and  presently, %0aalso,  scolding,  and  Malice ;  and  more  than  that,  how  there %0abe  Gods  that  are  Patrons  of  Theft  and  Wickedness.  He  is %0aa  God  to  a  Man  that  helpeth  Him :  and  this  is  the  true  Way %0ato  everlasting  Glory.  In  this  Way  went  the  Romans  in  old %0aTime  :  and  in  this  Track,  at  this  Day,  goeth,  with  heavenly %0aPace,  Vespasian  Augustus,  with  his  Children ;  the  most %0amighty  Ruler  of  the  whole  World  :  relieving  the  afflicted %0aState  of  the  Empire.  And  this  is  the  most  ancient  Manner %0aof  Requital  to  such  Benefactors,  that  they  should  be  enrolled %0awith  the  Gods.  And  hereof  came  the  Names  as  well  of  all %0aother  Gods,  as  of  the  Stars  (which  I  have  mentioned  before), %0ain  Recognisance  of  Men's  good  Deserts.  As  for  Jupiter  and %0aMercury,  and  others  ranged  among  the  Gods,  who  doubteth %0athat  they  were  called  otherwise  among  themselves  ?  and  who %0aconfesseth  not  how  these  be  celestial  Denominations,  to  ex- %0apress and  interpret  their  Nature  ? %0a%0aTo  suppose  that  the  sovereign  Power,  whatsoever  it  is, %0ashould  exercise  Care  over  Mankind,  is  ridiculous.  For  can %0awe  choose  but  believe  that  the  Godhead  must  be  polluted %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  37 %0a%0awith  so  base  and  manifold  a  Ministry  ?  And  hardly  can  it %0abe  judged,  whether  it  be  better  for  Mankind  to  believe  that %0athe  Gods  have  Regard  of  us,  or  that  they  have  none  ;  con- %0asidering that  some  Men  have  no  Respect  and  Reverence  for %0athe  Gods,  and  others  so  much  that  their  Superstition  is  a %0aShame  to  them.  These  are  devoted  to  them  by  foreign  Cere- %0amonies .-  they  wear  their  Gods  upon  their  Fingers  in  Rings, %0ayea,  they  worship  Monsters  :  they  forbid  some  Meats ;  and %0ayet  they  devise  others.  They  impose  upon  them  hard %0aCharges,  riot  suffering  them  to  rest  and  sleep  in  quiet.  They %0achoose  neither  Marriages,  nor  Children,  nor  any  one  Thing %0aelse,  but  by  the  Allowance  of  sacred  Rites.  Others  are  so %0agodless,  that  in  the  very  Capitol  they  use  Deceit,  and  for- %0aswear themselves  even  by  the  Thunder  of  Jupiter.  And  as %0asome  speed  well  with  their  Irreligion,  so  others  suffer  from %0atheir  own  holy  Ceremonies. %0a%0aBetween  these  Opinions,  Men  have  found  out  a  Medium %0aof  Divine  Power,  to  the  End  that  there  should  be  a  still  more %0auncertain  Conjecture  regarding  God.  For  throughout  the %0awhole  World,  in  every  Place,  at  all  Times,  and  in  all  Men's %0aMouths,  Fortune  alone  is  called  upon  :  she  only  is  named ; %0ashe  alone  is  blamed  and  accused.  None  but  she  is  thought %0aupon ;  she  only  is  praised,  she  only  is  rebuked  ;  yea,  and %0aworshipped  with  railing :  and  even  when  she  is  taken  to  be %0amutable  :  and  of  the  most  sort  supposed  also  to  be  blind : %0aroving,  inconstant,  uncertain,  variable,  and  favouring  the %0aUnworthy :  whatever  is  spent  and  lost,  whatever  is  gotten  : A %0aand  in  all  Men's  Accounts  she  makes  up  the  Book.  Even %0athe  very  Chance  of  Lots  is  taken  for  a  God,  by  which  God %0ahimself  is  shewn  to  be  uncertain. %0a%0aThere  is  another  Sort  that  reject  Fortune,  but  attribute %0aEvents  to  their  Stars,  and  the  ascendant  of  their  Nativity : %0aaffirming  that  the  same  shall  ever  happen  which  once  hath %0abeen  decreed  by  God  :  so  that  he  for  ever  after  may  remain %0aat  Rest.  And  this  Opinion  now  takes  deep  Root,  insomuch %0aas  both  the  learned  and  the  ignorant  Multitude  agree  to  it. %0a%0a1  "  Won  and  gotten,"  to  balance  "  spent  and  lost." %0a%0a%0a38  History  of  Nature.

Divus  Augustus  Ccesar  hath %0arecorded  that  his  left-foot  Shoe  was  untowardly  put  on  be- %0afore the  right,  on  that  very  Day  when  he  had  like  to  have %0asuffered  in  a  Mutiny  among  his  Soldiers. %0a%0aThus  all  these  Things  entangle  silly  Mortals,  so  that  this %0aonly  point  remaineth  certain — that  Nothing  is  certain :  nei- %0ather is  there  any  Thing  more  wretched  and  proud  than %0aMan.  For  all  living  Creatures  beside  take  Care  only  for %0atheir  Food  :  wherein  Nature's  Goodness  of  itself  is  sufficient : %0awhich  one  Point  is  to  be  preferred  before  all  good  Things %0awhatsoever,  inasmuch  as  they  never  think  of  Glory,  Riches, %0aAmbition,  nor,  beyond  all  the  rest,  of  Death.  However,  the %0aBelief  that  in  these  Matters  the  Gods  have  care  of  Men's %0aEstate,  is  profitable  to  the  Course  of  Life :  as  also  that  the %0aPunishment  of  Malefactors  will  come,  though  late  (whilst %0aGod  is  busily  occupied  in  so  huge  a  Frame  of  the  World), %0abut  that  it  never  misseth  in  the  End :  and  that  Man  was  not %0amade  so  near  in  Degree  unto  God,  for  this,  that  he  should %0abe  almost  as  base  as  the  brute  Beasts.  Moreover,  the  chief %0aComfort  that  Man  hath,  for  his  Imperfections  in  Nature,  is %0athis,  that  even  God  himself  cannot  do  all  Things.  For  nei- %0ather is  He  able  to  work  his  own  Death,  if  even  He  desired  it, %0aas  He  hath  given  to  Man  as  his  best  Gift  when  he  is  weary %0aof  the  Miseries  of  his  Life ;  nor  endow  Mortals  with  ever- %0alasting Life ;  nor  recall  the  Dead  to  Life  again ;  nor  bring  to %0apass  that  one  who  lived  did  not  live  ;  nor  he  that  bore %0ahonourable  Offices,  has  not  borne  them.  Nay,  He  hath  no %0aPower  over  Things  past,  save  only  Oblivion  :  no  more  than %0aHe  is  able  to  effect  (to  come  with  Arguments  to  prove  our %0aFellowship  therein  with  God)  that  twice  ten  should  not  make %0atwenty :  and  many  similar  Things.  Whereby  is  evidently %0aproved  the  Power  of  Nature,  and  how  it  is  she  only  which  we %0acall  God.

The %0aStars,  which  we  said  were  fixed  in  the  World,  are  not  (as  the %0acommon  Sort  thinketh)  assigned  to  every  one  of  us ;  namely, %0athe  bright  for  the  rich ;  the  less  for  the  poor :  the  dim  for %0athe  weak  and  feeble  :  neither  shine  they  out  more  or  less, %0aaccording  to  the  Fortune  of  every  one,  nor  arise  they  each %0aone  together  with  that  Person  unto  whom  they  are  appro- %0apriated ;  and  die  likewise  with  the  same :  nor  yet  as  they  set %0aand  fall,  do  they  signify  that  any  Body  is  dead.  There  is %0anot  so  great  a  Society  between  Heaven  and  us,  that,  together %0awith  the  Necessity  of  our  Death,  the  Light  of  the  Stars %0ashould  fade.  When  they  are  thought  to  fall,  they  do  but %0ashoot  from  them  a  Quantity  of  Fire  out  of  that  Abundance %0aof  Nutriment  which  they  have  gotten  by  the  Attraction  of %0aMoisture  unto  them  :  like  as  we  also  observe  in  lighted %0aLamps  with  the  Liquor  of  Oil1.  The  celestial  Bodies,  which %0aframe  the  World,  and  are  compact  together,  have  an  im- %0amortal Nature  :  and  their  Power  extendeth  much  to  the %0aEarth  :  which  by  their  Operations,  Light  and  Greatness, %0amight  be  known,  though  they  are  so  subtle  ;  as  we  shall  in %0adue  Place  make  Demonstration.  The  Mariner  likewise  of  the %0aheavenly  Circles  shall  be  shewn  more  fitly  in  our  "Geogra- %0aphical Treatise  of  the  Earth  ;"  forasmuch  as  the  Consideration %0athereof  appertaineth  wholly  thereunto :  only  we  will  not  put %0aoff  the  Devisers  of  the  Zodiac,  wherein  the  Signs  are  placed. %0a%0aThe  Obliquity  of  this,  Anaximander  the  Milesian  is %0areported  to  have  observed  first,  and  thereby  opened  the  Pas- %0asage to  Astronomy,  and  the  Knowledge  of  these  Things  : %0aand  this  happened  in  the  fifty-eighth  Olympiad.  Afterwards %0aCleostratus  marked  the  Signs  therein  ;  and  those  first  of %0aAries  and  Sagittarius.  As  for  the  Sphere  itself,  Atlas  devised %0ait  long  before.

Moreover,  the  Motion  of  all  the  Planets,  and %0aalso  of  the  Sun  and  Moon,  go  a  contrary  Course  to  that  of %0athe  starry  Heaven  ;  namely,  to  the  left  hand  [i.  e.  eastward]  ; %0awhereas  the  said  Sky  itself  always  hasteneth  to  the  right %0a[i.  e.  westward].  And  whereas  in  that  continual  turning %0awith  exceeding  Celerity,  those  Planets  be  lifted  up  aloft,  and %0ahurried  by  it  into  the  West,  and  there  set :  yet  by  a  contrary %0aMotion  of  their  own,  they  pass  every  one  through  their %0aseveral  Ways  eastward  ;  and  this  because  that  the  Air,  roll- %0aing ever  one  Way>  and  to  the  same  Part,  by  the  continual %0aturning  of  the  Heaven,  should  not  grow  stagnant  whilst  the %0aGlobe  thereof  resteth  idle ;  but  should  be  minutely  divided %0aby  the  violent  adverse  Action  of  these  Stars.  The  Planet %0aSaturn  is  of  a  cold  and  frozen  Nature,  but  the  Circle %0aof  Jupiter  is  much  lower  than  it,  and  therefore  his  Revo- %0alution is  performed  with  a  more  speedy  Motion,  in  twelve %0aYears.  The  third,  of  Mars,  which  some  call  Hercules,  is %0afiery  and  ardent,  by  Reason  of  the  Sun's  Vicinity,  and  run- %0aneth his  Race  in  about  two  Years.  And  it  is  by  the  exceed- %0aing Heat  of  Mars,  and  the  Cold  of  Saturn,  that  Jupiter,  who %0ais  placed  betwixt,  is  well  tempered  of  them  both,  and  so  be- %0acometh  salutary.  Next  to  them  is  the  Course  of  the  Sun, %0aconsisting  of  360  Parts  [or  Degrees]  :  but  that  the  Observa- %0ation of  the  Shadows  which  he  casteth  may  return  again  to %0atheir  former  Marks,  five  Days  be  added  to  every  Year,  with %0athe  fourth  Part  of  a  Day  over  and  above.  Whereupon,  in %0aevery  fifth  Year  one  odd  Day  is  added  to  the  Rest ;  to  the %0aEnd  that  the  Reckoning  of  the  Seasons  may  agree  with  the %0a%0a1  The  planets  since  discovered  —  two  of  them,  Herschel,  or  Uranus, %0aand  the  new,  and  as  yet  unnamed,  star,  still  more  remote  than  it,  and  the %0aothers  exceedingly  small  —  must  have  been  beyond  the  reach  of  ancient %0aobservation,  from  ignorance  of  the  telescope.—  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  41 %0a%0aCourse  of  the  Sun.  Beneath  the  Sun  there  is  a  large  Star %0acalled  Venus,  which  wandereth  this  Way  and  that,  by  turns ; %0aand  by  her  Names  testifieth  her  Emulation  of  the  Sun  and %0aMoon.  For  while  she  anticipateth  the  Morning,  and  riseth %0aOrientally,  she  taketh  the  Name  of  Lucifer,  as  a  second  Sun %0ahastening  the  Day.  Contrariwise,  when  she  shineth  from %0athe  West,  lengthening  the  Daylight,  and  supplying  the  Place %0aof  the  Moon,  she  is  named  Vesper.  This  Nature  of  hers, %0aPythagoras  of  Samos  first  found  out,  about  the  42nd %0aOlympiad  ;  which  was  the  142nd  Year  after  the  Foundation %0aof  Rome.  Now  this  Planet,  in  Greatness,  exceedeth  all  the %0aother  Stars :  and  so  shining  also,  that  the  Beams  of  this  Star %0aonly  cast  Shadows  upon  the  Earth.  And  hereupon  cometh %0asuch  great  Diversity  of  the  Names  thereof;  for  some  have %0acalled  it  Juno,  others  Isis,  and  others  the  Mother  of  the %0aGods.  By  the  natural  Efficacy  of  this  Star  all  Things  are %0agenerated  on  Earth.  For  whether  she  rise  in  the  East  or %0aWest,  she  sprinkleth  all  the  Earth  with  prolific  Dew,  and %0anot  only  filleth  the  same  with  Seed,  but  stirreth  up  to  in- %0acrease the  Nature  of  all  living  Creatures.  This  Planet  goeth %0athrough  the  Circle  of  the  Zodiac  in  348  Days,  departing %0afrom  the  Sun  never  above  46  Degrees,  as  Timceus  was  of %0aOpinion.  Next  unto  it,  but  Nothing  of  that  Bigness  and %0aPower,  is  the  Star  Mercury,  of  some  called  Apollo :  carried %0aalong  in  an  inferior  Circle,  after  the  like  Manner,  but  in %0aa  swifter  Course  by  nine  Days  ;  shining  sometimes  before  the %0aSun  rising,  at  others  after  his  setting,  never  farther  distant %0afrom  him  than  23  Degrees,  as  both  the  same  Timceus  and %0aSosigenes  teach.  And  therefore  these  two  Planets  have  a %0apeculiar  Consideration  from  others,  and  not  common  with %0athe  rest  above-named.  For  those  are  seen  from  the  Sun %0aa  fourth,  yea,  and  third  Part  of  the  Sky  :  oftentimes  also  in %0aOpposition  against  the  Sun.  And  all  of  them  have  other %0agreater  Circuits  of  full  Revolution,  which  are  to  be  spoken %0ain  of  the  Discourse  of  the  great  Year1. %0a%0a1  The  enumeration  of  the  planets  here  given  is  on  the  Ptolemaic  sys- %0atem of  astronomy,  which  supposes  the  earth  to  be  fixed  in  the  centre  of %0a%0a%0a42  .History  of  Nature.

She  with  her %0achanging  in  many  Shapes,  hath  troubled  much  the  Minds  of %0aBeholders,  angry  because  that  of  this  Star,  the  nearest  of  all, %0athey  should  be  the  most  ignorant;  growing  as  it  doth,  or %0aelse  wasting  continually.  One  while  she  bended  into  Horns  ; %0aanother  while  divided  in  the  half,  and  again  moulded  into  a %0arounded  Figure :  spotted  sometime,  arid  soon  after,  on  a %0asudden,  exceeding  bright :  one  while  large  and  full,  and  sud- %0adenly nothing  to  be  seen.  Sometime  shining  all  Night  long, %0aand  at  others  late  ere  she  riseth ;  she  also  helpeth  the  Sun's %0aLight  some  Part  of  the  Day;  eclipsed,  and  yet  visible  in %0athat  Eclipse.  The  same  at  the  Month's  End  lieth  hidden, %0aat  which  Time  (it  is  supposed)  she  laboureth  not.  At  one %0aTime  she  is  below,  and  presently  aloft :  and  that  not  after %0aone  Manner,  but  one  while  reaching  up  to  the  highest  Hea- %0aven, and  another  while  close  to  the  Mountains  ;  now  mounted %0ato  the  North,  and  again  brought  down  to  the  South.  Which %0aseveral  Motions  in  her,  the  first  Man  that  observed  was %0aEndymion :  and  hence  sprung  the  Report  that  he  was  ena- %0amoured of  the  Moon.  We  are  not  thankful,  as  we  ought  to %0abe,  to  those  who  by  their  Labour  and  Care  have  given  us %0aLight  in  this  Light ;  but  we  are  delighted  rather  (such  is  the %0awicked  Disposition  of  Man)  to  record  in  Chronicles,  Blood- %0ashed and  Murders:  that  Men's  mischievous  Deeds  should  be %0aknown,  while  we  are  ignorant  of  the  World  itself.  The %0aMoon  being  next  to  the  Centre,  and  therefore  of  least  Com- %0apass, performeth  the  same  Course  in  seven-and-twenty  Days, %0aand  one-third  Part  of  a  Day :  which  Saturn,  the  highest %0aPlanet,  runneth  (as  we  said  before)  in  thirty  Years.

Likewise  that  she  loseth %0aher  Light  (as  the  Rest  of  the  Planets)  by  the  Brightness  of %0athe  Sun  when  she  approacheth  near.  For  she  shineth  by  bor- %0arowing of  him  her  Light,  much  like  to  that  which  we  see  in %0athe  Reflexion  of  the  Sunbeams  from  the  Water.  And  here- %0aupon it  is  that  she,  by  her  more  mild  and  imperfect  Power %0adissolveth,  and  also  increaseth,  so  much  Moisture  ;x  which %0athe  Sunbeams  may  consume.  Hence  it  cometh  also,  that %0aher  Light  is  not  equal  in  Sight,  because  it  is  only  when  she %0ais  opposite  to  the  Sun  that  she  appeareth  full :  but  in  all %0aother  days  she  sheweth  no  more  to  the  Earth  than  she  con- %0aceiveth  from  the  Sun.  In  Time  of  Conjunction,  she  is  not %0aseen  at  all  :  for  that  whilst  she  is  turned  away,  all  the %0aDraught  of  Light  she  casteth  back  again  from  whence  she %0areceived  it.  That  these  Stars  are  fed  with  earthly  Moisture, %0ais  evident  by  the  Moon ;  which,  so  long  as  she  appeareth  by %0athe  Half,  never  sheweth  any  Spots,  because  as  yet  she  hath %0anot  her  full  Power  of  Light  sufficient  to  draw  Humour %0aunto  her.  For  these  Spots  be  nothing  else  but  the  Dregs %0aof  the  Earth,  caught  up  with  other  Moisture  among  the %0aVapours.2 %0a%0a1  Lucretius  supposes  that  all  animals,  and  all  the  stars,  are  fed  by %0aexhalations  from  earth  and  air.  Lucian  also  expresses  the  same  idea.  And %0aas  Pliny  was  of  an  adverse  sect  to  the  Epicureans,  and  consequently  did %0anot  derive  it  from  them,  we  may  suppose  the  opinion  to  have  been  gene- %0arally received.

[BooK  II. %0a%0aCHAPTER  X. %0aOf  Eclipses  of  the  Sun  and  Moon :  and  of  the  Night1. %0a%0aTHE  Eclipse  of  the  Moon  and  Sun  is  a  Thing  throughout %0athe  universal  Contemplation  of  Nature  most  marvellous,  and %0aresembling  a  Prodigy,  and  shews  the  Magnitude  and  Shadow %0aof  these  two  Planets.  For  it  is  evident  that  the  Sun  is  hidden %0aby  the  Intervention  of  the  Moon ;  and  the  Moon  again  by %0athe  Opposition  of  the  Earth  :  as  also  that  the  one  doth  equal %0athe  other,  in  that  the  Moon,  by  her  Interposition,  bereaveth %0a%0a1  The  opinions  of  the  ancients  on  the  subject  of  Eclipses  were  two- %0afold:— that  of  the  vulgar  was  built  on  the  supposition  that  certain  sorce- %0arers, working  by  magic  art,  were  able  to  draw  this  planet  from  her  orbit, %0aeven  to  the  earth,  to  accomplish  their  nefarious  purposes  in  inflicting %0ainjury  on  particular  persons  or  on  communities.  They  were  supposed  to %0ahave  a  further  object  in  view,  by  compelling  her  to  deposit  on  some %0aappropriate  herbs  a  foam  that  was  useful  in  magic  arts  :  as  we  learn  from %0aApuleius  and  Lucan.  Horace  represents  his  witch  Canidia  as  thus  en- %0agaged, in  his  5th  and  17th  Epodes.  Under  these  circumstances  the  moon %0awas  supposed  to  labour  in  agony ;  and  the  method  taken  to  relieve  her %0athroes,  and  prevent  her  total  extinction,  was  by  making  such  a  clamour %0athat  the  verse  or  influence  might  not  ascend  to  her  sphere ;  and  by  not %0ahearing,  her  dread  might  be  relieved.  Livy  speaks  of  this  clamour  as  an %0aordinary  occurrence  (lib.  xxvi.) ;  but  it  does  not  seem  to  have  been  an %0aofficial  proceeding.  Another  opinion  was  founded  on  the  doctrines  of %0aDivinity,  and  therefore  formed  a  portion  of  the  religion  of  the  state  :  the %0aphenomena  being  regularly  observed,  reported,  and  registered  by  consti- %0atuted officers.  According  to  this  idea,  every  unusual  appearance  in  the %0asky  was  a  portent  of  some  coming  event  —  usually  of  an  awful  nature  — %0aand  which  it  became  the  priesthood  to  avert,  by  those  processions,  sacri- %0afices, and  supplications,  that  were  appointed  in  the  sacred  books,  as  appro- %0apriate to  each  appearance.  It  was  no  small  effort  of  courage,  as  well  as %0askill,  in  the  philosophers  whose  names  are  given  by  Pliny,  to  venture  to %0ainquire  into  the  nature  and  causes  of  phenomena  which  must  have %0aappeared  inscrutable  to  one  portion  of  the  public,  and  too  sacred  to  be %0ameddled  with  to  the  other.  The  operation  of  both  opinions  appears  in %0athe  narrative  that  Plutarch  gives  of  the  proceedings  of  Paulus  Emilius, %0apreparatory  to  the  battle  with  the  Macedonians,  where,  while  the  aid  of %0athe  philosopher,  Sulpitius  Gallus,  was  used  to  remove  their  fears,  his %0aown  office  of  augur  was  not  neglected  to  work  on  their  superstitious %0aconfidence.—  Wern.

Neither  is  the  Night  any  Thing  else  but %0athe  Shade  of  the  Earth.  The  Figure  of  this  Shadow  resem- %0ableth  a  Pyramid  pointed  forward,  or  a  Top  turned  upside %0adown :  namely,  when  it  falleth  upon  it  with  its  sharp  End, %0aand  goeth  not  beyond  the  Heights  of  the  Moon ;  for  no  other %0aStar  is  in  that  Manner  darkened :  and  such  a  Figure  as  this %0aalways  endeth  in  a  Point.  And  that  Shadows  grow  to  No- %0athing in  a  great  Distance,  appeareth  by  the  exceeding  high %0aFlight  of  some  Birds.  So  the  Confines  of  these  Shadows  is %0athe  utmost  Bound  of  the  Air,  and  the  Beginning  of  Mther. %0aAbove  the  Moon  all  is  pure  and  lightsome  continually.

But  the  Reason  why  the  Sun  and  Moon  are %0anot  both  in  the  Eclipse  at  set  Times  and  Monthly,  is  the %0aObliquity  of  the  Zodiac,  and  the  wandering  Turnings  of  the %0aMoon  (as  hath  been  said):  and  because  these  Planets  do  not %0aalways  in  their  Motion  meet  just  in  the  Points  of  the  ecliptic %0aLine,  that  is,  in  the  Head  or  Tail  of  the  Dragon. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XI. %0aOf  the  Magnitude  of  Stars. %0a%0aIT  is  this  Reason  that  lifteth  up  Men's  Minds  into  Hea- %0aven :  and  as  if  they  looked  down  from  thence,  discovereth %0aunto  them  the  Magnitude  of  the  three  greatest  Parts  of %0aNature.  For  the  Sun's  Light  could  not  wholly  be  taken %0aaway  from  the  Earth,  by  the  Moon  coming  between,  if  the %0aEarth  were  bigger  than  the  Moon.  But  the  Immensity  of %0athe  Sun  is  more  certainly  known,  both  by  the  Shadow  of  the %0aEarth  and  the  Body  of  the  Moon  :  so  that  it  is  needless  to %0ainquire  into  the  Magnitude  thereof,  either  by  the  Proof  of %0aEyesight,  or  by  Conjecture  of  the  Mind.  How  immea- %0asurable it  is,  appeareth  by  this,  that  Trees  which  are  planted %0ain  Limits  from  East  to  West,  cast  Shadows  equal  in  Propor- %0ation ;  although  they  are  many  Miles  asunder  in  Length :  as %0aif  the  Sun  were  in  the  Midst  of  them  all.  This  appeareth %0a%0a%0a46  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%0aalso  at  the  Time  of  the  Equinox  in  all  Regions  of  the  same %0aMeridian,  when  the  Sun  shineth  directly  over  Men's  Heads, %0aand  causeth  no  Shadow.  In  like  Manner,  the  Shadows  of %0athem  that  dwell  northerly  under  the  solstitial  Circle,  fall  all %0aat  Noontide,  northward,  but  at  Sunrising,  westward ;  which %0acould  not  be  possible  unless  the  Sun  were  far  greater %0athan  the  Earth.  Moreover,  when  he  riseth,  he  surpasseth %0ain  breadth  the  Mountain  Ida,  encompassing  the  same  at %0alarge  both  on  the  right  Hand  and  the  left,  which  only  is %0afrom  being  so  far  distant.  The  Eclipse  of  the  Moon  sheweth %0aalso  the  Magnitude  of  the  Sun,  by  an  infallible  Demon- %0astration ;  as  his  own  Eclipse  declareth  the  Littleness  of  the %0aEarth.  For  as  there  are  of  Shadows  three  Forms,  and  it  is %0aevident,  that  if  the  dark  material  Body  which  casteth  a  Sha- %0adow be  equal  in  Bigness  to  the  Light,  then  the  Shadow  is %0afashioned  like  a  Pillar,  and  hath  no  Point  at  the  End :  if  it %0abe  greater,  it  yieldeth  a  Shadow  like  a  Top  standing  upon %0athe  Point,  so  as  the  lower  Part  thereof  is  narrowest,  and %0athen  the  Shadow  likewise  is  of  infinite  length :  but  if  the %0aBody  be  less  than  the  Light,  then  is  represented  a  pyramidal %0aFigure,  falling  out  sharp-pointed  in  the  Top  ;  which  Manner %0aof  Shadow  appeareth  in  the  Moon's  Eclipse :  it  is,  without %0adoubt,  therefore,  that  the  Sun  is  much  larger  than  the %0aEarth,  as  the  same  is  seen  by  the  silent  Proofs  of  Nature %0aitself.  For  why,  in  dividing  the  Times  of  the  Year,  departeth %0athe  Sun  from  us  in  the  Winter?  even  because  by  means %0aof  the  Night's  length  he  may  refresh  the  Earth,  which %0aotherwise  he  would  have  burnt  up  :  for,  notwithstanding %0athis,  he  burneth  it  in  some  measure,  from  his  excessive %0aGreatness. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XII. %0a%0aThe  Inventions  of  Men  in  the  Observation  of  the  Heavens. %0a%0aTHE  first  Roman  that  published  the  true  Reason  of  both %0aEclipses  was  Sulpitius  Gallus,  who  afterwards  was  Consul %0awith  M.  Marcellus:  but  at  that  Time  being  a  Tribune,  the %0aDay  preceding  that  on  which  King  Perseus  was  vanquished %0aby  Paulus,  he  was  brought  by  the  General  into  open  Audi- %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%0aence  before  the  whole  Army,  to  foretel  the  Eclipse  which %0awas  about  to  happen  :  whereby  he  delivered  the  Army  from %0aAnxiety;  and  presently  after  he  compiled  a  Book  of  the %0asame.  But  among  the  Greeks,  Thales  Milesius1  was  the  first %0athat  investigated  it ;  who,  in  the  fourth  Year  of  the  48th %0aOlympiad  did  foreshew  the  Sun's  Eclipse  that  happened  in %0athe  Reign  of  Halyattes,  and  in  the  170th  Year  after  the %0aFoundation  of  the  City  of  Rome.  After  them,  Hipparchus %0acompiled  his  "  Ephemerides,"  containing  the  Course  and %0aAspects  of  both  these  Planets,  for  six  hundred  Years  en- %0asuing :  comprehending  also  the  Months  according  to  the %0aReckonings  of  sundry  Nations,  the  Days,  the  Hours,  the %0aSituation  of  Places,  the  Aspects,  and  Latitudes  of  divers %0aTowns  and  Countries ;  as  the  World  will  bear  him  witness : %0aand  that  no  less  assuredly,  than  if  he  had  been  privy  to %0aNature's  Counsels.  Great  Persons  and  excellent  these %0awere,  doubtless,  who,  above  the  Reach  of  the  Capacity  of %0amortal  Men,  found  out  the  Reason  of  the  Course  of  such %0amighty  Stars  and  divine  Powers  :  and  whereas  the  Mind  of %0aMen  was  before  at  a  Loss,  fearing  in  these  Eclipses  of  the %0aStars  some  great  Violence,  or  the  Death  of  the  Planets,  they %0asecured  them  in  that  behalf :  in  which  dreadful  Fear  stood %0aStesickorus  and  Pindarus  the  Poets  (notwithstanding  their %0alofty  Style),  and  particularly  at  the  Eclipse  of  the  Sun,  as %0awill  appear  by  their  Poems.  As  for  the  Moon,  Mortals %0aimagine  that  at  that  Time  by  Charms  she  is  enchanted,  and %0atherefore  help  her  by  dissonant  ringing  of  Basins.  In  this %0aTerror,  Nicias,  the  General  of  the  Athenians  (as  a  Man  igno- %0arant of  the  Cause),  feared  to  set  sail  with  his  Fleet  out  of %0a%0a%0a1  The  minuteness  of  observation  displayed  by  these  illustrious  philo- %0asophers, from  whom  Pliny  has  borrowed  his  materials,  appears  to  imply %0athe  existence  of  instruments  of  no  small  accuracy,  though  we  have  no %0aaccount  of  their  possessing  such.

Neither  be  these %0aEclipses  seen  in  all  Places  when  they  are  above  the  Earth, %0aby  Reason  sometimes  of  cloudy  Weather,  but  more  often,  for %0athat  the  Globe  of  the  Earth  hindereth  the  Sight  of  the  Con- %0avexity of  the  Heaven.  Within  these  two  hundred  Years  it %0awas  found  out  by  the  Sagacity  of  Hipparchus,  that  the  Moon %0asometime  was  eclipsed  twice  in  five  Months'  Space,  and  the %0aSun  likewise  in  seven.  Also  that  the  Sun  and  Moon  twice %0ain  thirty  Days  were  darkened  above  the  Earth  :  though  this %0awas  not  seen  equally  in  all  Quarters,  but  by  Men  in  divers %0aPlaces :  and  that  which  is  most  surprising  in  this  Wonder, %0ais,  that  when  it  is  agreed  that  the  Moon's  Light  is  dimmed %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%0aby  the  Shadow  of  the  Earth,  at  one  Time  this  Eclipse  hap- %0apeneth  in  the  West,  and  at  another  in  the  East :  as  also,  by %0awhat  Reason  it  happeneth,  that  seeing  after  the  Sun  is  up, %0athat  Shadow  which  hideth  the  Light  of  the  Moon  must %0aneeds  be  under  the  Earth  :  it  fell  out  once,  that  the  Moon %0awas  eclipsed  in  the  West,  and  both  Planets  were  seen  at  once %0aabove  the  Ground.  For  that  in  twelve  Days  both  these %0aLights  were  missing,  and  neither  Sun  nor  Moon  were  seen  :  it %0ahappened  in  our  Time,  when  both  the  Vespasians  (Emperors) %0awere  Consuls,  the  Father  the  third  Time,  and  the  Son  the %0asecond. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIV. %0aOf  the  Moons  Motion. %0a%0aIT  is  clear  that  the  Moon,  always  in  her  increasing,  hath %0aher  Horns  turned  from  the  Sun  toward  the  East :  but  in  her %0adecrease,  contrariwise  westward ;  and  also  that  she  shineth %0a(the  first  Day  of  her  Appearance)  three  quarters  and  the %0atwenty-fourth  Part  of  one  Hour,  and  so  riseth  in  Proportion %0athe  second  Day  forward  unto  the  full :  likewise  decreasing  in %0athe  same  Manner  to  the  Change.  She  is  also  always  hidden %0ain  the  Change  within  fourteen  Degrees  of  the  Sun.  By %0awhich  Argument  we  collect,  that  the  Magnitude  of  the  other %0aPlanets  is  greater  than  that  of  the  Moon,  because  they  ap- %0apear when  they  be  but  seven  Degrees  off.  But  the  Cause %0awhy  they  shew  less,  is  their  Altitude  :  like  the  fixed  Stars, %0awhich  by  Reason  of  the  Sun's  Brightness  are  not  seen  in %0athe  Daytime  :  whereas,  indeed,  they  shine  as  well  by  Day  as %0aNight:  and  that  is  manifestly  proved  by  Eclipses  of  the  Sun, %0aand  by  exceeding  deep  Pits1,  for  so  they  are  to  be  seen  by %0aDaylight. %0a%0a1  In  the  absence  or  imperfection  of  optical  instruments,  this  expedient %0awas  necessarily  resorted  to,  for  the  purpose  here  stated ;  but  the  improve- %0ament of  the  telescope  has  superseded  this  contrivance.

[Boox  II. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  XV. %0a%0aGeneral  Rules  concerning  the  Motions  and  Lights  of  other %0a%0aPlanets. %0a%0aTHOSE  three  Planets  which  we  say  are  above  the  Sun, %0aare  hidden  when  they  go  their  Course  with  him.  They  rise %0ain  the  Morning,  and  never  depart  farther  than  eleven  De- %0agrees. Afterwards  meeting  with  his  Rays,  they  are  covered  : %0aand  in  their  triple  Aspect  retrograde,  they  make  their  Morn- %0aing Stations  120  Degrees  off,  which  are  called  the  first :  and %0aby  and  by,  in  a  contrary  Aspect,  180  Degrees  off,  they  rise %0ain  the  Evening,  and  appear  as  Evening  Stars.  In  like  Sort %0aapproaching  from  another  Side  within  120  Degrees,  they %0amake  their  evening  Station,  which  also  they  call  the  second, %0auntil  he  overtake  them  within  twelve  Degrees ;  and  so  hide %0athem  :  and  these  are  called  the  Evening  Settings.  The %0aPlanet  Mars,  as  he  is  nearer  to  the  Sun,  feeleth  the  Sun- %0abeams by  a  quadrant  Aspect,  from  ninety  Degrees :  where- %0aupon that  Motion  took  the  Name  called  the  first  and  second %0aNonagenary,  from  both  Risings.  The  same  Planet  keepeth %0athis  stationary  Residence  six  Months  in  the  Signs :  whereas %0aotherwise,  of  his  own  Nature,  he  would  do  it  but  two  Months. %0aBut  the  other  Planets  in  both  Stations  continue  not  four %0aMonths  each.  The  other  two  inferior  Planets  are  hidden %0aafter  the  same  Manner  in  the  evening  Conjunction  :  and %0aleaving  the  Sun  in  as  many  Degrees,  they  make  their  morn- %0aing Rising  :  and  from  the  farthest  Bounds  of  their  Distance, %0athey  follow  after  the  Sun  :  and  after  they  have  once  over- %0ataken him,  they  set  again  in  the  Morning,  and  so  outgo %0ahim.  And  by  and  by  keeping  the  same  Distance,  in  the %0aEvening  they  rise  again  unto  the  same  Limits  which  we %0anamed  before,  from  whence  they  return  to  the  Sun,  and  by %0athe  evening  Setting  they  be  hidden.  The  Star  Venus  like- %0awise maketh  two  Stations,  according  to  the  two  Manners  of %0aher  Appearance,  Morning  and  Evening,  when  she  is  in  far- %0athest Bounds  of  her  Distance.  But  Mercury  keepeth  his %0aStations  so  small  awhile,  that  they  cannot  be  observed.

For  they  change  their  Magnitudes %0aand  Colours,  and  sometimes  they  approach  to  the  North, %0asometimes  they  go  back  toward  the  South,  and,  all  on  a  sud- %0aden, they  appear  one  while  nearer  to  the  Earth,  and  another %0awhile  to  the  Heaven  :  wherein,  if  we  shall  deliver  many %0aPoints  otherwise  than  former  Writers,  yet  we  confess,  that %0afor  these  Matters  we  are  beholden  unto  them,  who  first  made %0aDemonstration  of  seeking  out  the  Ways  thereto  :  and  there- %0afore let  no  Man  despair  of  profiting  and  going  forward  in %0aKnowledge  from  Age  to  Age.  For,  these  strange  Motions %0afall  out  upon  many  Causes.  The  first  is  by  Reason  of  those %0aCircles  in  the  Stars,  which  the  Greeks  call  Absides :  for  we %0aare  compelled  to  use  the  Greek  Terms.  Each  one  of  the %0aPlanets  hath  a  particular  Circle  by  itself,  and  these  different %0afrom  those  of  the  starry  Heaven  :  because  the  Earth  from %0athose  two  Points  which  they  call  Poles,  is  the  Centre  of  the %0aHeaven,  as  also  of  the  Zodiac,  situated  obliquely  between %0athem.  All  which  Things  are  certainly  known  to  be  so  be- %0ayond Question  by  the  Compass.  And  therefore  from  every %0aCentre  there  arise  their  own  Absides,  and  so  they  have %0adiverse  Circuits  and  different  Motions,  because  of  necessity %0athe  interior  Absides  must  be  shorter. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVI. %0a%0aWhy  the  same  Planets  seem  sometimes  higher,  and  sometimes %0a%0alower. %0a%0aTHE  highest  Absides,  therefore,  from  the  Centre  of  the %0aEarth  are  of  Saturn,  in  the  Sign  Scorpio :  of  Jupiter  in %0aVirgo :  of  Mars  in  Leo :  of  the  Sun  in  Gemini :  of  Venus  in %0aSagittarius:  of  Mercury  in  Capricorn:  and  in  the  Middle  of %0athe  said  Signs :  and  contrariwise  the  said  Planets  in  the %0asame  Degrees  of  the  opposite  Signs  are  lowest  and  nearest %0ato  the  Centre  of  the  Earth.  So  it  happeneth  that  they  seem %0ato  move  more  slowly  when  they  go  their  highest  Circuit :  not %0afor  that  natural  Motions  do  either  hasten  or  slacken,  which %0a%0a%0a52  History  of  Nature.  [Boon.  ii. %0a%0abe  certain  and  several  to  every  one,  but  because  the  Lines %0awhich  are  drawn  from  the  Top  of  the  Absis  must  needs %0aapproach  each  other  about  the  Centre,  as  the  Spokes  in %0aWheels  :  and  the  same  Motion,  by  Reason  of  the  Nearness %0aof  the  Centre,  seemeth  in  one  Place  greater,  in  another  less. %0aThe  other  Cause  of  their  Sublimities  is,  for  that  in  other %0aSigns  they  have  the  Absides  elevated  highest  from  the %0aCentre  of  their  own  eccentric  Circles.  Thus  Saturn  is  in  the %0agreatest  Height  in  the  20th  Degree  of  Libra,  Jupiter  in  the %0a15th  of  Cancer,  Mars  in  the  28th  of  Capricorn,  the  Sun  in %0athe  29th  of  Aries,  Venus  in  the  1 6th  of  Pisces,  Mercury  in %0athe  15th  of  Virgo,  and  the  Moon  in  the  4th  of  Taurus.  The %0athird  Reason  of  their  Altitude  is  not  taken  from  their  Circles, %0abut  understood  by  the  Convexity  of  the  Sky,  for  that  these %0aPlanets  seem  to  the  Eye,  as  they  rise  and  fall,  to  mount  up %0aor  settle  downward  through  the  air.  To  this  is  united  an- %0aother Cause  also,  which  is,  the  Zodiac  Obliquity  and  Latitude %0aof  the  Planets,  in  Regard  of  the  Ecliptic  :  for  through  it  the %0aStars  which  we  called  wandering  do  take  their  Course. %0aNeither  is  there  any  Place  inhabited  upon  Earth,  but  that %0awhich  lieth  under  it.  For  all  the  Rest  without  the  Poles  are %0adesert.  Only  the  Planet  Venus  goeth  beyond  the  Circle  of %0athe  Zodiac,  two  Degrees  :  which  is  supposed  to  be  the  effi- %0acient Cause,  that  certain  living  Creatures  are  bred  even  in %0athe  desert  Parts  of  the  World.  The  Moon  likewise  rangeth %0athroughout  all  the  Breadth  of  it,  but  never  goeth  out  of  it. %0aNext  after  these  the  Star  Mercury  hath  the  largest  Scope %0ain  the  Zodiac,  but  yet  so,  as  of  twelve  Degrees  (for  that  is  the %0aBreadth  thereof)  he  wandereth  but  eight,  and  those  not %0aequally,  but  two  in  the  midst,  four  above,  and  two  beneath. %0aThen  the  Sun  in  the  midst,  goeth  always  between  the  two %0aExtremities  of  the  Zodiac ;  but  in  his  declining  Course  he %0aseemeth  to  wind  unequally,  after  the  Manner  of  Serpents. %0aMars  leaveth  the  ecliptic  Line  four  half  Degrees,  Jupiter %0atwo  Degrees  and  a  half,  Saturn  two,  like  as  the  Sun.  Thus %0ayou  see  the  Manner  of  the  Latitudes,  as  they  descend  south- %0award, or  ascend  northward.  And  upon  this  is  the  Reason %0agrounded  of  the  third  Opinion  of  them,  who  imagine  that %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  53 %0a%0athe  Planets  do  rise  and  mount  from  the  Earth  upward  into %0aHeaven.  For  very  many  have  thought,  although  untruly, %0athat  they  climb  in  this  Manner.  But  to  the  End  that  they %0amay  be  confuted,  we  must  lay  open  an  immense  Subtlety, %0awhich  containeth  all  those  Causes  and  Reasons  abovesaid. %0aFirst,  therefore,  this  is  admitted,  that  these  Stars  in  their %0aEvening  Setting  are  nearest  to  the  Earth,  both  in  Latitude %0aand  Altitude  :  and  when  they  be  farthest  from  the  Earth,  as %0awell  in  Latitude  as  Elevation,  they  appear  in  the  Morning %0abefore  the  Sun  :  as  also  that  then  they  are  Stationaries  in  the %0amiddle  Points  of  the  Latitudes,  which  they  call  Ecliptics. %0aLikewise  it  is  acknowledged,  that  so  long  as  the  Planets  are %0anear  to  the  Earth,  their  Motion  increaseth  :  and  as  they  de- %0apart on  hi«:h  it  decreaseth.  And  this  Reason  is  confirmed %0aprincipally  by  the  Elevations  of  the  Moon.  And  it  is  beyond %0aa  Doubt,  that  every  Planet  in  its  Morning  Rising  riseth %0aevery  Day  higher  than  the  former.  The  superior  three %0aabove  the  Sun  diminish  from  their  first  Stations  unto  the %0asecond.  Which  being  so,  it  will  plainly  appear,  that  every %0aPlanet  rising  before  the  Sun  ascendeth  to  the  Latitudes :  so %0athat  from  the  Time  they  begin,  their  Motion  increaseth  by %0alittle  and  little  more  sparely.  But  in  the  first  Stations,  they %0aare  at  the  highest  Altitude :  for  then  first  the  Numbers  begin %0ato  be  withdrawn,  and  the  Planets  to  go  backward  ;  whereof %0aa  particular  Reason  may  be  given  in  this  Manner :  the %0aPlanets  being  smitten  in  that  Part  whereof  we  spoke,  they %0aare  both  restrained  by  the  triangular  Beams  or  trine  Aspect %0aof  the  Sun,  to  hold  on  a  direct  Course,  and  are  raised  up %0aaloft  by  the  fiery  Power  of  the  said  Sun.  This  cannot  im- %0amediately be  understood  by  our  Eyesight :  and  so  they  are %0asupposed  to  stand,  and  hence  the  Name  of  Stations  is  de- %0arived. Then  proceedeth  forward  the  Violence  of  the  Sun's %0aBeams,  and  the  Vapour  thereof,  by  Repercussion,  forceth %0athem  to  go  backward.  And  much  more  is  this  perceived %0ain  their  Evening  Rising,  when  the  Sun  is  wholly  against %0athem,  and  they  be  driven  to  the  very  Top  of  their  Absides, %0aand  so  not  seen  at  all,  because  they  are  at  the  highest,  and %0aare  carried  on  by  their  least  Motion,  which  is  so  much  the %0a%0a%0a54  History  of  Nature.  [  BOOK  II. %0a%0aless,  when  it  happeneth  in  the  highest  Signs  of  their  Absides. %0aFrom  the  evening  Rising  the  Latitude  descendeth,  for  now  the %0aMotion  less  diminisheth,  but  yet  increaseth  not  before  the %0asecond  Stations :  because  they  are  forced  to  descend  by  Rea- %0ason of  the  Sunbeams  coming  from  the  other  Side  ;  and  the %0asame  Force  beareth  them  downward  to  the  Earth,  which  by %0athe  former  triangular  Aspect  raised  them  aloft  toward  Hea- %0aven. Of  so  much  Importance  is  it  whether  these  Beams %0acome  from  beneath  or  above.  The  same  happeneth  much %0amore  in  the  Evening  Setting.  This  is  an  Explanation  of %0athe  Motions  of  the  superior  Planets;  but  the  Theory  of  the %0arest  is  more  difficult,  and  hath  by  no  Man  before  us  been %0adelivered. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVII. %0a%0aGeneral  Rules  concerning  the  Planets. %0a%0aFIRST,  therefore,  let  us  set  down  the  Cause  why  Venus %0anever  departeth  from  the  Sun  more  than  forty-six  Degrees, %0aand  Mercury  not  above  twenty-three  :  and  why  oftentimes %0athey  retire  back  unto  the  Sun  within  that  Space.  To  be %0aresolved  in  this  Point,  we  must  remark,  that  both  of  them %0ahave  their  Absides  turned  opposite  to  the  rest,  as  being %0aseated  under  the  Sun  :  and  so  much  of  their  Circles  is  under- %0aneath, as  the  forenamed  were  above ;  and  therefore  farther %0aoff  they  cannot  be,  because  the  Curvature  of  their  Absides %0ain  that  Place  hath  no  greater  Longitude.  Therefore  both %0aMargins  of  their  Absides,  by  a  like  Proportion,  keep  Mean, %0aand  their  Course  is  limited :  but  the  short  Spaces  of  their %0aLongitudes  they  compensate  by  the  wandering  of  their  Lati- %0atudes. But  what  is  the  Reason  that  they  reach  not  always %0ato  forty-six  Degrees,  and  to  twenty-three?  They  do  so  truly: %0abut  here  the  Explanation  fails.  For  it  is  apparent,  that  their %0aAbsides  also  move,  because  they  never  overpass  the  Sun. %0aAnd  therefore  when  their  Margins  from  either  Side  are  per- %0aceived to  fall  upon  the  very  Point,  then  the  Planets  also  are %0aunderstood  to  reach  unto  their  longest  Distances  :  but  when %0atheir  Margins  be  short  so  many  Degrees,  the  Stars  them- %0aselves are  thought  to  return  more  speedily  in  their  Retro- %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  55 %0a%0agradation  than  in  their  direct  Course  forward,  though  their %0autmost  Extremity  is  ever  the  same.  And  from  hence  is  the %0aReason  understood  of  the  contrary  Motions  of  these  two %0aPlanets.  For  the  superior  Planets  move  most  swiftly  in  the %0aEvening  Setting,  but  these  most  slowly.  They  be  highest %0aabove  the  Earth,  when  they  move  slowest ;  and  these,  when %0athey  go  swiftest :  for  as  in  the  former  the  Nearness  of  the %0aCentre  hasteneth  them,  so,  in  these,  the  Extremity  of  the %0aCircle  :  they,  from  their  Morning  Rising,  begin  to  slacken %0atheir  Celerity ;  but  these  to  increase  it :  they  return  back %0afrom  their  Morning  Station  to  their  Evening  Mansion ;  but %0aVenus,  contrariwise,  is  retrograde  from  the  Evening  Station %0ato  that  of  the  Morning.  But,  she  from  the  Morning  Rising %0abeginneth  to  climb  the  Latitude  :  but  to  follow  the  Altitude %0aand  the  Sun  from  the  Morning  Station  :  as  being  most  swift %0aand  at  the  highest  in  the  Morning  Setting.  Moreover  she %0abeginneth  to  digress  in  Latitude,  and  to  diminish  her  Motion, %0afrom  the  Morning  Rising :  but  to  be  retrograde,  and  to  digress %0ain  Altitude,  from  the  Evening  Station.  Again,  the  Planet %0aMercury  rising  in  the  Morning,  beginneth  both  Ways  to %0aclimb,  but  to  digress  in  Latitude  from  the  Evening  Rising : %0aand  when  the  Sun  hath  overtaken  him  within  the  Distance %0aof  fifteen  Degrees,  he  standeth  still  for  four  Days  almost %0aimmovable.  Presently,  he  descendeth  from  his  Altitude, %0aand  goeth  back  from  the  Evening  Setting  to  that  of  the %0aMorning.  This  Star  only,  and  the  Moon,  descend  in  as %0amany  Days  as  they  ascend.  But  Venus  ascendeth  up  to  her %0aStation  in  fifteen  Days  and  a  little  more.  Again,  Saturn  and %0aJupiter  are  twice  as  long  descending,  and  Mars  four  Times. %0aSo  great  Variety  is  in  their  Nature,  but  the  Reason  thereof  is %0aevident.  For  they  which  go  against  the  Vapour  of  the  Sun %0ado  also  descend  with  Difficulty.  Many  Secrets  more  of %0aNature,  and  Laws  whereunto  she  is  obedient,  might  be  shewn %0aabout  these  Things.  As,  for  Example:  the  Planet  Mars, %0awhose  Course,  of  all  others,  can  be  least  observed,  never %0amaketh  Station  but  in  quadrate  Aspect :  and  Jupiter,  in %0atriangular  Aspect ;  and  very  seldom  separated  from  the  Sun %0asixty  Degrees,  which  Number  maketh  six  angled  Forms  of %0a%0a%0a56  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%0athe  Heaven  (that  is,  it  is  the  sixth  Part  of  the  Heaven) : %0aneither  doth  Jupiter  shew  his  rising  in  any,  save  only  two %0aSigns,  Cancer  and  Leo.  The  Planet  Mercury  seldom  hath %0ahis  Evening  Rising  in  Pisces,  but  very  often  in  Virgo  ;  and %0athe  Morning  Rising  in  Libra.  In  like  Manner,  the  Morning %0aRising  is  in  Aquarius,  but  very  seldom  in  Leo.  Neither %0abecometh  he  retrograde  in  Taurus  and  Gemini  :  and  in %0aCancer,  not  under  the  twenty-fifth  Degree.  As  for  the %0aMoon,  she  entereth  not  twice  in  Conjunction  with  the  Sun %0ain  any  other  Sign  but  Gemini :  and  sometime  hath  no  Con- %0ajunction at  all,  and  that  only  in  Sagittarius.  As  for  the  last %0aand  first  of  the  Moon,  to  be  seen  in  the  same  Day  or  Night, %0ahappeneth  in  no  other  Sign  but  in  Aries,  and  few  Men  have %0ahad  the  Chance  to  see  it.  And  hereupon  came  Linceus  to  be %0aso  famous  for  his  Eyesight.  Also,  the  Planets  Saturn  and %0aMars  appear  not  in  the  Heaven  at  the  most  170  Days: %0aJupiter  36,  or  at  least  ten  Days  wanting  :  Venus  69,  or  when %0aleast,  52 :  Mercury  13,  or  at  least,  17. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XVIII. %0aWhat  is  the  Cause  that  the  Planets  alter  their  Colours  ? %0a%0aTHE  Reason  of  the  Planet's  Altitudes  is  it  that  tetnpereth %0atheir  Colours,  for  they  take  the  Likeness  of  the  Air,  into %0awhich  they  enter ;  and  the  Circle  of  another  Planet's  Motion %0acoloureth  them  as  they  approach  either  Way,  ascending  or %0adescending.  The  colder  setteth  a  pale  Colour,  the  hotter  a %0ared,  and  the  windy  a  fearful  Hue.  Only  the  Points  and %0aConjunctions  of  iheAbsides,  and  the  utmost  Circumferences, %0ashew  a  dark  black.  Each  Planet  hath  a  several  Colour; %0aSaturn  is  white,  Jupiter  clear  and  bright,  Mars  a  fiery  red, %0aVenus  glowing,  when  Lucifer;  when  Occidental,  or  Vesper, %0aresplendent  ;  Mercury  sparkling,  the  Moon  pleasant,  the %0aSun  when  he  riseth,  burning,  afterwards  radiating1.  Upon %0a%0a1  Many  of  the  colours  here  mentioned  are  only  optical  deceptions,  but %0athat  of  the  planet  Mars  must  proceed  from  something  inherent  in  the %0aplanet  itself,  or  the  atmosphere  by  which  it  is  surrounded ;  for  while %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  57 %0a%0athese  Causes  the  Sight  is  entangled,  and  discovereth  those %0aStars  also  which  are  fixed  in  the  Sky.  For  one  while  a %0aNumber  of  them  appear  about  the  Half-moon,  when  in  a %0aclear  and  calm  Night  she  gently  beautlfieth  them ;  and  at %0aanother  they  are  seen  but  here  and  there,  insomuch  that  we %0amay  wonder  how  they  are  fled  upon  the  full  Moon,  which %0ahideth  them  ;  or  when  the  Beams  either  of  the  Sun  or  other %0aabovesaid  have  dazzled  our  Sight.  Yea,  the  Moon  herself %0aperceiveth  the  Sun's  Beams,  as  they  come  upon  her :  for %0athose  Rays  that  come  sidelong,  according  to  the  Convexity %0aof  the  Sky,  give  but  an  obscure  Light  to  the  Moon,  in  Com- %0aparison of  them  that  fall  directly  with  straight  Angles.  And, %0atherefore,  in  the  quadrangular  Aspect  of  the  Sun  she  ap- %0apeareth  divided  in  Half;  in  the  triangular  she  is  well  near %0aenvironed,  but  her  Circle  is  half  empty ;  but  in  Opposition %0ashe  appeareth  full.  And  again,  as  she  is  in  the  Wane,  she %0arepresenteth  the  same  Forms,  decreasing  by  Quarters  as  she %0aincreased  :  with  like  Aspects  as  the  other  three  Planets %0aabove  the  Sun. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XIX. %0a%0aThe  Reason  of  the  Suns  Motion,  and  the  Inequality  of  Days. %0a%0aTHE  Sun  himself  hath  four  Differences  in  his  Course  : %0atwice  in  the  Year,  in  Spring  and  Autumn,  making  the  Night %0aequal  to  the  Day ;  for  then  he  falleth  on  the  Centre  of  the %0aEarth,  in  the  eighth  Degree  of  Aries  and  Libra.  Twice %0alikewise  he  exchangeth  the  Compass  of  his  Race  :  to  lengthen %0athe  Day  from  the  Bruma,  or  Midwinter,  in  the  eighth  De- %0agree of  Capricorn;  and  again  to  lengthen  the  Night  from  the %0asummer  Solstice,  being  in  as  many  Degrees  of  Cancer.  The %0aCause  of  unequal  Days  is  the  Obliquity  of  the  Zodiac:  when %0athe  one  Half  of  the  World  is  at  all  Times  above  and  under %0athe  Earth.  But  (hose  Signs  which  mount  upright  in  their %0a%0ait  reflects  to  us  a  red  tinge,  the  light  it  obtains  from  the  sun  is  the  same %0awith  that  which  comes  to  us  from  the  sun,  and  in  which  the  prismatic %0arays  produce  a  colourless  mixture.— Wern.

Therefore,  as  out  of  burning  Wood  a  Coal  of %0aFire  flieth  forth  with  a  Crack,  so  from  a  Star  is  spit  out  this %0acelestial  Fire,  carrying  with  it  Presages  of  future  Things :  so %0athat  it  sheweth  Divine  Operations,  even  in  these  Portions %0awhich  are  cast  away  as  superfluous.  And  this  most  com- %0amonly happeneth  when  the  Air  is  troubled;  either  because %0athe  collected  Moisture  stirreth  that  Abundance  to  fall ;  or %0abecause  it  is  disquieted,  as  it  were,  with  a  Birth  from  a %0apregnant  Star. %0a%0a1  Much  of  the  religious  system  of  the  ancients  was  founded  on  the %0apersuasion  that  every  appearance  of  lightning  and  thunder,  as  well  as %0aother  aerial  phenomena,  were  direct  manifestations  of  Divine  interposition %0ain  the  affairs  of  men ;  and  a  college  of  officers  (augurs)  was  appointed  to %0aobserve,  record,  report,  and  explain  such  appearances,  for  the  guidance  of %0athe  state  in  its  most  important  proceedings.  From  a  slight  expression  of %0aPliny  in  the  course  of  this  chapter,  it  appears  that  he  hesitated  to  deny %0athis  popular  idea  in  a  direct  manner  :  in  apprehension,  perhaps,  of  laying %0ahimself  open  to  the  charge  of  infidelity.  But  by  implication,  he  expresses %0ahis  disbelief  of  what  was  so  generally  credited;  for  the  ascribing  to  the %0anatural  effect  of  Jupiter  as  a  planet,  what  was  believed  by  the  priests  and %0athe  state  to  be  a  voluntary  action  of  Jupiter,  the  supreme  deity,  can  be %0aregarded  as  little  better  than  a  subterfuge.  For  a  natural  explanation  of %0athunder  and  lightning,  such  as  it  is,  the  reader  is  referred  to  chapter %0axliii.  of  this  book  ;  and  for  other  curious  particulars,  to  the  chapters  l.-lv. %0a—  Wern.

But  Pytha- %0agoras, a  Man  of  much  Sagacity,  hath  collected,  that  there %0aare  126,000  Stadia1  from  the  Earth  to  the  Moon,  and  a %0adouble  Distance  from  her  to  the  Sun,  and  from  thence  to  the %0atwelve  Signs  three  Times  so  much.  Of  which  Opinion  was %0aalso  our  countryman,  Gallus  Sulpitius. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXII. %0aOf  the  Music  of  the  Planets. %0a%0aBUT  Pythagoras  at  the  same  Time  uses  the  Terms  of %0aMusic,  by  calling  the  Space  between  the  Earth  and  the %0aMoon  a  Tone ;  saying,  that  from  her  to  Mercury  is  Half  a %0aTone :  and  from  him  to  Venus  about  the  same  Space.  But %0afrom  her  to  the  Sun  so  much  and  a  Half  more  :  but  from  the %0aSun  to  Mars  a  Tone,  that  is  to  say,  as  much  as  from  the %0aEarth  to  the  Moon.  From  him  to  Jupiter  Haifa  Tone: %0alikewise  from  him  to  Saturn  Half  a  Tone  :  and  so  from %0athence  to  the  Zodiac  so  much  and  a  Half  more.  Thus  are %0acomposed  seven  Tunes,  which  Harmony  they  call  Diapason; %0athat  is  to  say,  the  Universality  of  Consent.  In  this,  Saturn %0arnoveth  by  the  Doric  Tune ;  Mercury  by  Phthongus,  Jupiter %0aby  the  Phrygian,  and  the  Rest  likewise :  a  Subtlety  more %0apleasant  than  needful2. %0a%0a1  The  Stadium  differed  in  different  countries ;  but  the  standard  may %0abe  fixed  at  a  furlong ;  as  may  be  seen  in  chapter  xxiii.    One  hundred  and %0atwenty-five  paces  make  a  stadium.    In  the  larger  numbers,  therefore,  it %0ahas  been  sometimes  judged  best  to  translate  the  equivalent  expressions %0ainto  miles.  —  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a2  Ideas  of  the  harmony  of  creation  seem  to  have  entered  deeply  into %0athe  opinions  of  Pythagoras,  on  the  system  of  creation,  and  especially  on %0a%0a%0a60 %0a%0a%0aHistory  of  Nature. %0a%0a%0a[BooK  II. %0a%0a%0aCHAPTER  XXIII. %0aThe  Geometry  of  the  World. %0a%0aA  STADIUM  maketh  of  our  Paces  125,  that  is  to  say,  625 %0aFeet.  Posidonius  saith,  that  from  the  Earth  it  is  no  less  than %0aforty  Stadia  to  that  Height  wherein  thick  Weather,  Winds, %0aand  Clouds  are  formed.  Above  this,  the  Air  is  pure,  clear, %0aand  light,  without  any  troubled  Darkness.  But  from  the %0acloudy  Region  to  the  Moon  is  2,000,000  Stadia :  from  thence %0ato  the  Sun,  5000.  By  means  of  which  Interval  it  cometh  to %0apass,  that  so  exceeding  great  as  the  Sun  is,  he  burneth  not %0a%0athe  order  and  distances  of  the  planets,  the  motions  of  which  he  appears  to %0ahave  compared  to  the  graceful  and  measured  dances  of  the  ancients  to %0athe  sound  of  the  harp.  But,  as  often  happens,  when  philosophers  confine %0atheir  views  of  Nature  to  a  single  aspect,  what  has  a  shadow  of  truth  in %0aitself  becomes,  when  thus  interpreted,  egregious  trifling.  The  supposition %0aenounced  is,  that  not  only  are  the  motions  performed  according  to  musical %0atime,  but  the  intervals  between  the  chords  (of  each  planet's  path)  are %0aproperly  measured  by  their  relative  tones.  The  following  diagram,  taken %0afrom  the  notes  to  Dalechamp's  edition  of  Pliny,  will  more  clearly  repre- %0asent the  ideas  of  this  eminent  Greek  philosopher : — %0a%0a%0a12THESPH, %0a%0a%0aTERRA      THE     EARTH %0a%0a%0aThe  tone  or  unit  of  Pythagoras  is  taken  for  125,000  stadia,  or  15,625 %0amiles. —  Wern.

These %0aPoints  are  undiscovered,  and  beyond  Man's  Reach  ;  but  they %0amay  now  be  delivered  to  others,  as  they  have  been  taught : %0ain  which,  notwithstanding,  one  infallible  Reason  of  a  geome- %0atrical Collection  cannot  be  rejected,  if  a  man  would  search %0adeep  into  these  Matters.  Neither  need  a  Man  to  seek  an %0aexact  Measure  hereof  (for  to  desire  that  is  a  foolish  Idleness), %0abut  only  to  make  an  Estimate  of  Probability.  For,  whereas %0ait  is  clear  by  the  Course  of  the  Sun,  that  the  Circle  through %0awhich  he  passeth  containeth  three  hundred,  threescore,  and %0aalmost  six  Degrees  ;  and  it  is  a  Rule  that  the  Diameter %0aformeth  a  third  Part  of  the  Circumference,  and  little  less %0athan  a  seventh  Part  of  a  third :  it  is  plain,  that  deducting %0aone  Half  thereof  (because  the  Earth,  situated  in  the  Centre, %0acometh  between),  about  the  sixth  Part  of  this  great  Circuit %0awhich  he  maketh  about  the  Earth  (so  far  as  our  Mind  doth %0acomprehend),  is  the  very  Height  from  the  Earth  up  to  the %0aSun,  but  the  twelfth  Part  to  the  Moon,  because  she  runneth %0aso  much  a  shorter  Circuit  than  the  Sun  ;  whereby  it  ap- %0apeareth,  that  she  is  in  the  Midst  between  the  Earth  and  the %0aSun.  It  is  a  Wonder  to  see  how  far  the  Presumption  of  the %0aHeart  of  Man  will  proceed  when  instigated  by  some  little %0aSuccess,  as  in  the  abovenamed  Matter.  The  Reason  whereof %0aministereth  plenteous  Occasion  of  Impudency,  for  they  who %0adared  to  give  a  Guess  at  the  Space  between  the  Sun  and  the %0aEarth  are  so  bold  as  to  do  the  like  from  thence  to  Heaven. %0aFor,  presuming  that  the  Sun  is  in  the  Midst,  they  have  at %0atheir  Fingers'  Ends  the  very  Measure  of  the  whole  World. %0aFor  how  many  seven  Parts  the  Diameter  hath,  so  many %0atwenty-two  Parts  hath  the  whole  Circle :  as  if  they  had  got- %0aten the  certain  Measure  of  the  Heaven  by  the  Plumb-line. %0aThe  Egyptians,  according  to  the  Reckoning  which  Petosiris %0aand  Necepsos  have  invented,  do  collect,  that  every  Degree  in %0athe  Circle  of  the  Moon,  which  is  the  least  (as  hath  been  said) %0aof  all  other,  containeth  thirty-three  Stadia,  and  somewhat %0amore;  in  Saturn^  the  greatest  of  all,  double  as  much  ;  and  in %0athe  Sun,  which  we  said  was  the  midst,  the  Half  of  both  Mea- %0a%0a%0a62  History  of  Nature.

Sometimes  the  Planets  and  other  Stars  are %0aspread  over  with  Hairs ;  but  a  Comet J  is  never  seen  in  the %0aWest  Part  of  the  Heaven. %0a%0aA  fearful  Star,  for  the  most  Part,  this  Comet  is,  and  not %0aeasily  expiated2  :  as  it  appeared  by  the  late  civil  Troubles %0awhen  Octavius  was  Consul :  as  also  a  second  Time  by  the %0aWar  of  Pompey  and  Ccesar.

For,  that  Joy  of  his  he  testified  in  these %0aWords :  In  those  very  Days  of  my  Games,  there  was  seen  a %0aComet  for  seven  Days  together,  in  that  Region  of  the  Sky %0awhich  is  under  the  North  Star.  It  arose  about  the  eleventh %0aHour  of  the  Day,  bright  and  clear,  and  evidently  seen  in  all %0aLands.  By  that  Star  it  was  signified  (as  the  common  Sort %0abelieved)  that  the  Soul  of  (Julius)  Csesar  was  received  among %0athe  Divine  powers  of  the  immortal  Gods.  In  which  regard, %0athat  Mark  of  a  Star  was  set  on  the  Head  of  the  Statue  of %0aJulius  Caesar,  which  soon  after  we  dedicated  in  the  Forum. %0aThese  Words  he  published  abroad  :  but  in  a  more  inward %0aJoy  to  himself,  he  interpreted  that  this  Comet1  was  made  for %0a%0a1  It  is  a  strong  proof  of  the  popular  bias  at  that  time,  as  well  as  of  the %0apolitical  tact  of  Augustus,  that  he  was  so  far  able  to  dissipate  the  appre- %0ahensions usually  entertained  on  the  appearance  of  a  comet,  as  to  convert %0athe  phenomenon  into  a  prognostic  of  especial  good  to  his  government ; %0aand  to  associate  with  it,  what  he  wished  them  to  believe  of  the  Divine %0aadoption  of  his  deceased  uncle,  the  Dictator.     The  latter  had,  indeed,  al- %0aready given  him  some  examples  of  the  art  of  overruling  a  portent,  when %0aits  understood  meaning  did  not  correspond  with  his  wishes ;  and  Suetonius %0aobserves,  that  no  ominous  presage  could  ever  deter  or  divert  him  from %0athe  prosecution  of  his  designs.    That  this  celestial  phenomenon,  which %0aappeared  about  an  hour  before  sunset,  and  was  seen  for  seven  successive %0adays,  excited  much  attention,  appears  from  Ovid  ("  Metamorphoses," %0ab.  xv.),  who  speaks  of  it  as  if  he  wished  to  avoid  the  dreaded  name  of %0aComet,  a  word  which,  in  the  original,  Pliny  also  does  not  use : — %0a"  Dumque  tulit,  lumen  capere,  atque  ignescere  sensit, %0aEmisitque  sinu.

Dalechamp  mentions  a  Roman  coin,  bearing  on  the  obverse %0athe  head  and  inscription  of  the  deified  Caesar,  and,  on  the  reverse,  a  temple %0aof  Venus,  with  a  star,  and  a  statue  of  Caesar  in  the  augural  dress,  and  an %0a%0a%0a(From  a  Coin  in  the  British  Museum.) %0a%0aaltar  for  offerings  and  vows,  with  the  inscription,  "  Divo  Julio."  It  was %0abecause  of  this  alleged  consanguinity  to  the  goddess,  that  at  his  funeral %0athe  Repository  was  made  in  the  form  of  the  temple  of  this  divinity.  The %0aorigin  of  this  story  of  the  star  of  Venus  may  be  traced  to  a  Phoenician  or %0aTrojan  source ;  for  we  find,  in  the  Fragments  of  Sanchoniatho,  the  fol- %0alowing account : — "  But  travelling  about  the  world,  she  found  a  star  fall- %0aing from  the  sky ;  which  she,  taking  up,  consecrated  in  the  Holy  Island %0aTyre.  And  the  Phoenicians  say,  that  Astarte  is  she  who  is  amongst  the %0aGreeks  called  Aphrodite:' — (Bishop  Cumberland's  Trans,  p.  36.)  This %0aTyrian  or  Trojan  deity  was  the  Marine  Venus,  and  is  to  be  distinguished %0afrom  Venus  Urania,  the  heavenly,  the  greatest ;  who,  according  to  Cicero, %0a(N.  D.  iii.  23.)  and  other  authority,  was  the  Syrian  Astarte,  and  the %0aAshteroth  of  sacred  Scripture ;  whose  ensigns  were :  on  her  head,  the %0ahorns  of  a  bull ;  about  her,  thunderbolts ;  and  round  her,  many  stars. %0aLucian,  describing  her  statue,  which  he  had  seen,  says :  "  She  had  a  splen- %0adid stone  on  her  head,  which  was  called  xvx»b,  which  in  the  night  gave %0amuch  light  to  the  temple,  but  shone  weakly  in  the  day-time,  and  looked %0alike  fire.  Nor  were  these,  the  Roman  deities  Venus  and  Juno,  the  only %0apowers  that  were  designated  by  a  star.

Also, %0ahistorical  Examples  of  Torches,  Lamps,  Beams,  Fiery %0aDarts,  Opening  of  the  Firmament. %0a%0aHIPPARCHUS,  the  aforesaid  Philosopher  (a  man  never %0asufficiently  praised,  as  being  he  that  more  than  any  other %0aproved  the  Affinity  of  Stars  with  Men ;  affirming  also,  that %0aour  Souls  were  Parcel  of  Heaven),  discovered  and  observed %0aa  new  Star  produced  in  his  Time,  and  by  the  Motion  thereof %0aon  the  Day  it  first  shone,  he  was  led  into  a  doubt,  whether  it %0ahappened  not  very  often  that  new  Stars  should  arise  ?  and %0awhether  those  Stars  also  moved  not,  which  we  imagine  to  be %0afixed  ?  The  same  Man  went  so  far,  that  he  attempted  (a %0aThing  even  hard  for  God  to  perform)  to  deliver  unto  Pos- %0aterity the  exact  Number  of  the  Stars.  He  brought  the  said %0aStars  within  the  Compass  of  Rule,  by  devising  certain  In- %0astruments to  take  their  several  Places,  and  set  out  their %0aMagnitudes  :  that  thereby  it  might  be  easily  discerned,  not %0aonly  whether  the  old  died,  and  new  were  born,  but  also %0awhether  they  moved,  and  which  Way  they  took  their  Course? %0alikewise,  whether  they  increased  or  decreased?  Thus  he  left %0athe  Inheritance  of  the  Sky  unto  all  Men,  if  any  one  haply %0acould  be  found  able  to  enter  upon  it  as  lawful  Heir. %0a%0aThere  be  also  certain  flaming  Torches  shining  out  in  the %0aSky,  though  they  are  never  seen  but  when  they  fall.  Such %0aan  one  was  that  which,  at  the  Time  that  Germanicus  Ccesar %0aexhibited  a  Show  of  Gladiators,  passed  at  Noontide  in  the %0a%0arefers  to  a  male  deity,  that,  so  early  as  the  days  of  Moses,  was  worshipped %0ain  a  portable  shrine  by  the  people  of  Israel,  and  by  them  probably  derived %0afrom  Egypt.  A  star  thus  became  associated  with  the  idea  of  Divine %0abenignity ;  and  how  widely  so,  appears  from  the  history  of  the  Magi, %0awho  came  from  the  East  to  Jerusalem,  to  seek  out  the  Desire  of  all  Nations, %0ain  pursuance  of  a  prophecy  that  must  have  been  of  the  highest  antiquity. %0a—  Wern.

And %0athese  Things  I  suppose  to  come  at  certain  Times  by  Course %0aof  Nature,  like  other  Things;  and  not,  as  the  most  Part %0a%0a1  Showers  of  blood  have  been  recorded  in  chronicles  of  various  ages ; %0aand  in  those  turbulent  times  it  was  never  difficult  to  find  some  public %0aevil  which  such  unwonted  phenomena  might  be  supposed  to  have  fore- %0atold. By  modern  inquiry  these  appearances  have  been  ascribed  to  the %0aexcrements  of  a  mighty  swarm  of  butterflies — to  the  extraordinary  abun- %0adance of  an  animalcula,  called  Oscellatoria  Vubesuns —  and  to  the  red %0avegetable  Protococcus  Nivalis,  swept  up  by  winds  from  the  snow,  on  which %0ait  naturally  grows.  None  of  these  explanations,  however,  appear  to  an- %0aswer so  completely  to  Pliny's  account,  as  the  following;  to  which  the %0aEditor  was  once  a  witness.  On  the  15th  of  February,  1837,  when  the %0aweather  had  long  been  damp,  misty,  and  rather  windy  —  the  direction  of %0athe  wind  being  South  of  West  —  at  a  quarter  of  an  hour  after  five  in  the %0aevening,  there  came  in  a  mist,  of  a  bright  red  colour ;  which  attracted %0aattention,  through  a  window,  by  the  glare  of  light  it  diffused.  On  pro- %0aceeding to  examine  it  in  the  open  air,  it  was  observed  to  have  become  of %0aa  pink  colour ;  and  presently  passing  into  violet,  it  settled  into  a  grey ;  in %0awhich  tint  it  remained  until  the  evening  hid  it  from  view.  No  refraction %0aof  sunbeams  can  be  allowed  to  account  for  this  appearance ;  for  the  sun %0ahad  long  before  been  hidden  by  intervening  hills  from  the  valley  in %0awhich  this  beautiful  coloured  mist  appeared.—  Wern.

Once  they  are  reported  to %0ahave  been  seen  at  Noon-day  in  the  Bosphorus,  and  they  con- %0atinued from  Morning  to  the  Evening.  Three  Suns  together %0aour  Ancestors  have  often  beheld ;  as,  for  instance,  when %0aSp.  Posthumius  with  Q.  Mutius,  Q.  Martins  with  M.  Porcius, %0aM.  Antonius  with  P.  Dolabella,  and  Mar.  Lepidus  with %0aL.  Plancus,  were  Consuls.  And  our  Age  hath  seen  the  like  in %0athe  Time  of  Divus  Cl.

That  the  former  of  these  consuls  was  capable  of  any %0aviolence  or  fraud,  to  secure  political  preponderance,  appears  from  his  his- %0atory in  connexion  with  the  Gracchi.  He  was  openly  accused  of  forging %0aportents ;  and  when  one  of  his  lictors  had  knocked  down  Tiberius  Grac- %0achus, whose  person  as  tribune  was  sacred,  in  the  riots  that  followed  he %0aoffered  a  reward,  of  its  weight  in  gold,  for  the  head  of  his  opponent.  The %0abribe  was  successful :  the  head  was  found  to  weigh  171bs.  8oz. ;  and  to %0ashew  his  pious  gratitude  for  the  result,  as  well,  perhaps,  as  to  divert %0apublic  attention,  he  built  a  temple  to  Concord.— Wern.

On  one  occasion,  in  a  very  dark  night,  two  or  three  indivi- %0aduals, scarcely  able  to  grope  their  way,  were  surprised  at  finding  them- %0aselves able  to  see  every  object  as  clearly  as  in  a  moderate  daylight.

They  are  dangerous  when  they %0acome  singly,  for  they  sink  those  Ships  on  which  they  alight ; %0a%0a1  Luminous  meteors  are  mostly  seen  at  night ;  since  daylight  is  too %0apowerful  to  allow  them  to  be  seen.  They  have  not  been  studied  as  the %0asubject  deserves ;  and  hence  the  futility  of  the  explanations  generally %0agiven  to  their  causes.  There  is  little  doubt,  that  they  differ  greatly  in %0anature.  Some  are  undoubtedly  electric;  as  may  be  judged  from  their %0asudden  explosion,  sometimes  with  signs  of  great  violence.  The  appear- %0aances termed  Castor  and  Pollux,  and  among  modern  sailors  Corbisant,  or %0aCorpo  Santo,  is  exceedingly  rare  on  land,  and  in  the  British  seas ;  but %0acommon  in  warmer  latitudes  than  Britain.  Light  of,  perhaps,  the  same %0anature,  is  sometimes  seen  on  the  ears  of  animals,  as  the  horse,  when  tra- %0avelling in  stormy  weather.  Pliny  speaks  of  being  himself  an  eye-witness %0ato  the  settling  of  meteors  on  the  military  spears  ;  and  there  is  a  record  of %0aa  similar  appearance  in  the  sixth  volume  (p.  38)  of  Hearne's  edition  of %0aLeland's  Itinerary:  "In  the  yere  of  our  Lord  1098,  Corborant,  admiral %0ato  the  Soudan  of  Perce,  was  faught  with  at  Antioche,  and  discumfited  by %0athe  Christianes.

But  if  the  Pair  appear,  they  are  salutary,  and  foretel %0aa  prosperous  Voyage ;  for  by  their  coming,  it  is  supposed  that %0athe  dreadful  and  threatening  Meteor  called  Helena,  is  driven %0aaway.  And  therefore  it  is,  that  Men  assign  this  mighty %0aPower  to  Castor  and  Pollux,  and  invocate  them  as  Gods  at %0aSea.  Men's  Heads,  also,  in  the  Evening  are  seen  to  shine %0around  about ;  which  presageth  some  great  Matter.  Of  all %0athese  Things  there  is  no  certain  Reason  to  be  given  ;  but  they %0aare  hidden  in  the  Majesty  of  Nature. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXVIII. %0aOf  the  Air. %0a%0aHITHERTO  we  have  treated  of  the  World  itself,  and  the %0aStars.  It  remaineth  now  to  speak  of  other  memorable %0aThings  observed  in  the  Sky.  For  even  that  Part  also  have %0aour  Forefathers  called  Cesium,  or  the  Sky,  which  otherwise %0athey  name  the  Air :  even  all  that  Portion  which  seeming %0alike  a  void  and  empty  Place,  yieldeth  this  vital  Spirit %0awhereby  all  Things  do  live.  This  Region  is  seated  beneath %0athe  Moon,  and  far  under  that  Planet  (as  I  observe  it  is,  in %0aManner,  by  all  Men  agreed  upon).  And  mingling  together %0aan  infinite  Portion  of  the  superior  celestial  Nature  of  Air, %0awith  very  much  of  earthly  Vapours,  it  doth  participate  con- %0afusedly of  both.  From  hence  proceed  Clouds,  Thunders, %0aand  those  terrible  Lightnings.  From  hence  come  Hail, %0aFrosts,  Rain,  Storms,  and  Whirlwinds :  from  hence  arise %0amost  of  the  Calamities  of  mortal  Men,  and  the  continual %0aWar  that  Nature  maketh  with  herself.  For  these  gross %0aExhalations,  as  they  mount  upward  to  the  Heaven,  are %0abeaten  back  by  the  Violence  of  the  Stars  :  and  the  same %0aagain  draw  up  to  them  those  Matters,  which  of  their  own %0aAccord  ascend  not.  For  thus  we  see,  that  Showers  of  Rain %0afall,  Mists  arise,  Rivers  are  dried  up,  Hail-storms  came  down %0aamain,  the  Sunbeams  scorch  the  ground,  and  drive  it  every %0awhere  to  the  midst :  but  the  same  again  unbroken,  and  not %0aloosing  their  Force,  rebound  and  take  up  with  them  whatso- %0a%0a%0a74  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  II. %0a%0aever  they  are  able.  Vapours  fall  from  aloft,  and  return  again %0aon  high:  forcible  Winds  come  empty,  but  return  with  a %0aBooty.  So  many  living  Creatures  draw  their  Breath  from %0aabove :  but  the  same  laboureth  contrariwise,  and  the  Earth %0ainfuseth  into  the  Air  a  Spirit  as  if  it  were  empty.  Thus,  while %0aNature  goeth  to  and  fro,  as  forced  by  some  Engine,  by  the %0aSwiftness  of  the  Heaven  the  Fire  of  Discord  is  kindled. %0aNeither  can  she  stand  to  the  Fight,  but  being  continually %0acarried  away  she  is  rolled  about,  and  as  she  spreadeth  about %0athe  Earth,  with  an  immeasurable  Globe  of  the  Heaven,  so %0aever  and  anon  through  the  Clouds  she  frameth  another  Sky. %0aAnd  this  is  that  Region  where  the  Winds  reign.  And  there- %0afore their  Kingdom  principally  is  there  where  they  execute %0atheir  Forces.  For  Thunderbolts  and  Lightnings  most  Men %0aattribute  to  their  Violence.  Nay,  and  so  it  is  supposed  that %0asometimes  it  raineth  Stones,  which  may  be  taken  up  first  by %0athe  Wind  ;  and  many  similar  Appearances.  Wherefore  many %0aMatters  besides  are  to  be  treated  of  together. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XXXIX. %0aOf  Ordinary  Sedsons. %0a%0aIT  is  manifest  that  of  Seasons,  as  also  of  other  Things, %0asome  Causes  be  certain  ;  others,  casual ;  or,  such  as  yet  the %0aReason  thereof  is  unknown.  For  who  doubteth  that  Sum- %0amers and  Winters,  and  those  alternative  Seasons  which  we %0aobserve  by  yearly  Course,  are  occasioned  by  the  Motion  of %0athe  Planets?  As,  therefore,  the  Sun's  Nature  is  understood %0aby  tempering  and  ordering  the  Year,  so  the  rest  of  the  Stars %0ahave  every  one  their  peculiar  Power,  and  the  same  effectual %0ato  perform  their  own  Nature.  Some  are  fruitful  to  bring %0aforth  Moisture,  that  is  turned  into  liquid  Rain  :  others  to %0ayield  an  Humour  either  congealed  into  Frosts,  or  gathered %0aand  thickened  into  Snow,  or  else  frozen  into  Hail  :  some %0aafford  Winds ;  others  Warmth  :  some  hot  and  scorching %0aVapours ;  some,  Dews ;  and  others,  Cold.  Neither  ought %0athese  Stars  to  be  esteemed  no  more  than  they  shew  in  Sight, %0aseeing  that  none  of  them  is  less  than  the  Moon  ;  as  may %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  75 %0a%0aappear  by  the  Reason  of  their  exceeding  Height.

And  not  only  the  seven  Wandering  Stars  possess %0athis  Power,  but  many  of  them  also  that  are  fixed  in  the  Fir- %0amament ;  so  often  as  they  be  either  driven  by  the  Approach %0aof  those  Planets,  or  provoked  by  the  Casting  and  Influence %0aof  their  Beams  :  like  as  we  find  it  happeneth  in  the  seven %0aStars  called  Suculce,  which  the  Grecians,  of  Rain,  name %0aHyades  (because  they  ever  bring  foul  Weather).  Howbeit %0asome  of  their  own  Nature,  and  at  certain  set  Times,  do  cause %0aRain ;  as  the  Rising  of  the  Kids.

The  Seas  at %0ahis  Rising  do  rage,  the  Wines  in  Cellars  are  troubled,  stand- %0aing Waters  are  moved.

Club. %0a%0a2  Pliny  mentions  this  animal  in  book  x.  c.  73 ;  and  again  in  book  xi. %0ac.  46  ;  but  modern  naturalists  have  failed  to  identify  it  with  any  creature %0aknown  at  the  present  time.    Indeed,  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  more %0athan  one  creature  has  been  thus  designated  by  the  ancients ;  for  it  has %0abeen  described  as  having  only  one  horn;  which  would  make  it  either %0aa  species  of  rhinoceros,  or  the  animal  resembling  a  stag  or  horse,  so  often %0aspoken  of  under  the  name  of  Unicorn.    It  has  also  been  compared  to  an %0aox ;  and  four  horns  have  been  ascribed  to  it.  But,  more  precisely,  it  is  said %0ato  be  white,  with  horns  and  a  beard ;  which  renders  it  probable  that  it %0awas  of  the  goat  kind.    As  the  religion  of  the  ancient  Heathens  was  merely %0aceremonial,  the  imputing  to  the  creature,  in  the  practice  of  sneezing,  an %0aact  of  adoration  to  Anubis,  or  the  Dog- Star,  one  of  the  chief  deities  of  the %0a%0a%0a76  History  of  Nature.

And  this  is  proved,  not  only  by  Rains  and  Storms, %0a%0aEgyptians,  will  appear  less  absurd  than  at  the  first  mention  would %0aappear.  For  a  similar  reason  Pliny  ascribes  religion  to  elephants,  and %0aeven  poultry. %0a%0aIn  his  28th  book,  the  Author  (ch.  2)  has  some  observations  on  the %0asuperstition  of  the  Romans,  relative  to  the  act  of  sneezing ;  and  it  is %0anot  a  little  remarkable,  that  a  similar  practice,  of  imprecating  a  bless- %0aing in  such  case,  is  not  even  now  uncommon  among  ourselves. —  Wern. %0aClub. %0a%0a1  In  this  chapter  there  is  a  confusion  of  cause  and  effect  that  is  diffi- %0acult to  unravel ;  and  which  can  only  be  accounted  for  by  involving  what %0aare  undoubtedly  natural  influences  —  in  modern  times  easily  explained  — %0awith  occult  causes,  the  bounds  of  which  the  ancients  were  not  able  to %0adefine.  The  influence  of  the  sun's  heat  on  currents  of  air,  constituting %0awinds  and  tempests,  and  even  its  simple  action  on  the  texture  of  a %0amembrane,  are  thus  confounded  with  the  powers  which  the  Signs  of %0athe  Zodiac  were  supposed  to  exert  on  the  functions  of  the  organs  or  re- %0agions of  the  human  body.  According  to  this  philosopy,  each  of  the %0atwelve  signs  exerted  a  peculiar  influence  on  a  distinct  portion  ;  beginning %0awith  the  head,  which  was  governed  by  Aries;  and  proceeding  downward %0aby  regular  spaces,  each  opposite  sign  in  the  Annual  Circle  became  the %0amonarch  of  its  season,  until  the  Twins,  opposite  to  Aries,  displayed  their %0apower  over  the  feet.  To  the  reproach  of  modern  science,  these  imaginary %0ainfluences,  which  derived  their  origin  in  popular  opinion,  from  a  supposed %0asympathetic  connexion  of  the  spirit  pervading  these  signs  —  a  portion  of %0athe  great  soul  of  the  world  (Note  to  ch.  1),  and  therefore  a  portion  of %0aa  very  ancient  idolatry — maintains  its  place  in  the  popular  almanacs, %0apublished  under  the  superintendence  of  a  public  company  especially %0ainstituted  for  the  promotion  of  an  improved  literature. —  Wern.

It  is  the  more %0aShame  to  Man  to  be  ignorant,  especially  seeing  that  he  must %0aconfess,  that  some  labouring  Beasts  have  certain  Diseases  in %0atheir  Eyes,  which  with  the  Moon  do  grow  and  decay.

But  when  they  en- %0acounter a  Cloud,  there  ariseth  a  Vapour  with  a  dissonant %0aSound  (as  when  a  red-hot  Iron  maketh  an  Hissing  when %0athrust  into  Water),  and  Smoke  rolls  up  in  Waves.  Hence %0aStorms  are  bred.  And  if  this  Flatus,  or  Vapour,  do  struggle %0awithin  the  Cloud,  Thunder  is  given  out ;  if  it  break  through %0astill  burning,  then  flieth  out  the  Thunderbolt :  if  it  be  a %0a%0a1  An  attempt  to  explain  the  cause  of  thunder  and  lightning  could %0ascarcely  be  otherwise  than  futile,  in  the  entire  absence  of  a  knowledge  of %0athe  existence  of  such  a  matter  as  electricity.  But  any  attempt  at  a  natural %0aexplanation  was  an  effort  of  courage,  and  far  in  advance  of  the  popular %0aopinion.  On  this  account  the  Author  is  entitled  to  pardon,  when,  at  the %0aconclusion  of  the  chapter  he  finds  himself  disposed  to  make  some  conces- %0asion, in  admitting  it  to  be  possible,  that  some  of  these  phenomena  were %0apremonitory,  and  direct  from  the  gods. —  Wern.

The  Thunders  are  the  Blows  given  by  the  Fires %0abeating  hard  upon  the  Clouds :  and  therefore  presently  the %0afiery  Rifts  of  those  Clouds  do  flash  and  shine.  It  is  possible, %0aalso,  that  the  Wind,  elevated  from  the  Earth,  being  repelled, %0aand  kept  down  by  the  Stars,  and  so  restrained  within  a %0aCloud,  may  thunder,  while  Nature  choketh  the  rumbling %0aSound  all  the  while  it  striveth ;  but  sendeth  forth  a  Crash %0awhen  it  breaketh  out,  as  we  see  in  a  Bladder  puffed  up  with %0aWind.  Likewise  it  may  be,  that  the  same  Wind  or  Spirit  is %0aset  on  Fire  by  Attrition,  as  it  violently  passeth  headlong %0adown.  It  may  also  be  stricken  by  the  Conflict  of  the  Clouds, %0aas  if  two  Stones  hit  one  against  another ;  and  so  the  Flashes %0asparkle  forth.  But  all  these  are  Accidents.  And  from  hence %0acome  those  insignificant  and  vain  Lightnings,  which  have  no %0anatural  Cause.  With  these  are  Mountains  and  Seas  smitten  : %0aand  of  this  Kind  be  all  other  Explosions  that  do  no  Hurt  to %0aliving  Creatures.  Those  that  come  from  above,  and  of  fixed %0aCauses,  yea,  and  from  their  proper  Stars,  foretel  future %0aEvents.  In  like  Manner,  it  may  be  that  the  Winds,  or  rather %0aBlasts,  proceed  from  a  dry  Exhalation  of  the  Earth,  void  of %0aall  Moisture  :  neither  will  I  deny  that  they  arise  from  Waters %0abreathing  out  an  Air,  which  neither  can  thicken  into  a  Mist, %0anor  gather  into  Clouds :  also  they  may  be  driven  by  the %0aImpulsion  of  the  Sun,  because  the  Wind  is  conceived  to  be %0aNothing  else  but  the  flowing  of  the  Air,  and  that  by  many %0ameans.  For  some  we  see  to  rise  out  of  Rivers,  Snows,  and %0aSeas,  even  when  they  be  still  and  calm  :  as  also  others  out  of %0athe  Earth,  which  Winds  they  name  Altani.  And  those  verily %0awhen  they  come  back  again  from  the  Sea,  are  called  Tropcei: %0aif  they  go  onward,  Apogcei. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLIV. %0aWhat  is  the  Reason  of  the  Resounding  of  the  Echo. %0a%0aBUT  the  Windings  of  Hills,  and  their  close  Turnings, %0atheir  many  Tops,  their  Ridges  also  bending  like  an  Elbow, %0a%0a%0a80  History  of  Nature.

The  Place's  Name  is  Senta.  Moreover,  in %0athe  Province  Cyrenaica  there  is  reported  to  be  a  Rock  con- %0asecrated to  the  South-wind,  which  without  Profanation  may %0anot  be  touched  with  Man's  Hand  ;  but  if  it  be,  presently  the %0aSouth-wind  doth  arise  and  cast  up  Heaps  of  Sand.  Also  in %0amany  Houses  there  be  hollow  Places  devised  by  Man's  Hand %0afor  the  Receipt  of  Wind  ;  which  being  enclosed  with  Shade, %0agather  their  Blasts.  Whereby  we  may  see  how  all  Winds %0ahave  a  Cause.  But  great  Difference  there  is  between  such %0aBlasts  and  Winds.  As  for  these,  they  be  settled,  and  conti- %0anually blowing ;  which,  not  some  particular  Places,  but %0awhole  Lands  do  feel ;  which  are  not  light  Gales  nor  stormy %0aPuffs  of  the  Sea,  named  Aurce  and  Procellce,  but  properly %0a%0a1  That  there  is  an  intimate  connexion  between  the  interior  of  the %0aearth  and  the  atmosphere,  operating  in  the  production  or  direction  of  the %0anature  or  force  of  winds,  is  exceedingly  probable ;  although  the  particular %0ainstances  here  given  are  either  imaginary,  or  strangely  misinterpreted. %0aA  simple  change  in  the  pressure  of  the  atmosphere  —  a  meteorological %0aphenomenon  of  which  the  ancients  were  ignorant,  from  not  being  aware %0athat  air  possessed  positive  weight  —  will  account  for  many  of  these  sudden %0agusts  from  caverns ;  and  for  those  hollow  murmurs  that  have  been  popu- %0alarly remarked  in  hilly  countries,  before  the  approach  of  a  storm ;  and %0athe  utility  of  these  outbursts  will  appear  when  we  remember,  that  with- %0aout them,  poisonous  exhalations,  as  marsh  miasmata,  and  carbonic  acid %0agas,  would  be  suffered  to  accumulate,  to  the  destruction  of  a  neighbour- %0ahood.— Wern.

I  marvel  so  much %0athe  more,  that  the  World  being  so  at  Discord,  and  divided %0ainto  Kingdoms,  that  is  to  say,  dismembered  ;  so  many  Men %0ahave  employed  their  Care  to  seek  after  these  Things,  so  diffi- %0acult to  be  found  out ;  and  the  more  especially  in  Time  of %0aWars,  and  amid  those  Places  where  was  no  safe  Abode ;  and %0aespecially  when  Pirates,  those  common  Enemies  to  Mankind, %0aheld  well  near  all  Passages  of  Communication  :  I  marvel, %0aalso,  that  at  this  Day  each  Man  in  his  own  Tract  of  Country %0aobtaineth  more  Knowledge  of  some  Things  by  their  Com- %0amentaries, who  never  set  Foot  there,  than  he  doth  by  the %0aSkill  and  Information  of  home-born  Inhabitants  ;  whereas %0anow  in  Time  of  such  blessed  and  joyous  Peace,  and  under  a %0aPrince  who  taketh  such  Delight  in  the  Progress  of  the  State %0aand  of  all  good  Arts,  no  new  Thing  is  learned  by  farther %0aInquisition  ;  nay,  nor  so  much  as  the  Inventions  of  old  Wri- %0aters are  thoroughly  understood.  And  verily  it  cannot  be %0asaid,  that  greater  Rewards  were  in  those  Days  given,  consi- %0adering that  the  Bounty  of  Fortune  was  dispersed  :  and  in %0atruth,  most  of  these  learned  Men  sought  out  these  Secrets %0afor  no  other  Regard  than  to  do  good  to  Posterity.

The  Seas  are %0aopen  to  all,  an  infinite  Multitude  of  Sailors  have  discovered %0aall  Coasts  whatsoever ;  they  sail  through  and  arrive  fami- %0aliarly at  every  Shore  ;  but  all  is  for  Gain,  nothing  for  the %0aSake  of  Knowledge.  Their  Minds  altogether  blinded,  and %0abent  upon  nothing  but  Covetousness,  never  consider  that  the %0asame  might  with  more  Safety  be  performed  by  Science.  And %0atherefore,  seeing  there  be  so  many  thousand  Sailors  that %0ahazard  themselves  on  the  Seas,  I  will  treat  of  the  Winds  more %0acuriously  than,  perhaps,  would  otherwise  be  necessary  to  the %0apresent  Work. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVII. %0aMany  Sorts  of  Winds. %0a%0aTHE  Ancients  observed  four  Winds1  only,  according %0ato  so  many  Quarters  of  the  World  (and  therefore  Homer %0anameth  no  more)  :  a  feeble  Reason  this,  as  soon  after  it  was %0ajudged.  The  Age  ensuing  added  eight  more,  and  they  were %0aon  the  other  Side  in  their  Conceit,  too  subtle  and  concise. %0aThe  modern  Sailors  have  found  a  Mean  between  both :  and %0athey  put  unto  that  short  Number  of  the  first,  four  Winds %0aand  no  more  ;  which  they  took  out  of  the  latter.  Therefore %0aevery  Quarter  of  the  Heaven  hath  two  Winds  to  itself. %0aFrom  the  equinoctial  Sun-rising  bloweth  the  East  Wind,  Sub- %0asolanus:  from  the  Rising  thereof  in  Midwinter  the  South-east, %0aVulturnus.  The  former  of  these  two  the  Greeks  call  Apeliotes, %0aand  the  latter  Eurus.  From  the  Midday  riseth  the  South %0aWind :  and  from  the  Sun-setting  in  Midwinter  the  South-west, %0aAfricus.  They  also  name  these  two,  Notus  and  Libs.  From %0athe  equinoctial  going  down  of  the  Sun,  the  West  Wind, %0a%0a1  The  impression  of  this  precise  number  of  winds  appears  to  have  been %0apopular ;  and  is  referred  to  in  the  Book  of  Revelation  by  St.  John,  vii.  1 : %0a"  I  saw  four  angels  standing  on  the  four  corners  of  the  earth,  holding  the %0afour  winds  of  the  earth."  Pliny  evidently  supposes  that  the  winds  were %0anot  simply  determined  according  to  the  quarter  from  which  they  blew, %0abut  by  separate  and  inherent  qualities  of  heat,  moisture,  violence,  health, %0aor  sickness. — Wern.

From  the  North  bloweth  the  North  Wind,  Sep- %0atentrio:  between  which  and  the  Sunrising  in  Summer  is  the %0aNorth-east  Wind,  Aquilo,  named  Aparctias  and  Boreas  by  the %0aGreeks.  A  greater  Reckoning  than  this  for  Number  is %0abrought  in  by  some,  who  have  thrust  in  four  more  between : %0anamely,  Thracias  between  the  North  and  the  Summer  Setting %0aof  the  Sun  ;  in  like  Manner  Ccecias,  in  the  midst  between  the %0aNorth-east,  Aquilo,  and  that  of  the  Sunrising  in  the  equi- %0anoctial, Sub-solanus.  Also,  after  the  Sunrising  in  Summer, %0aPhceniceas  in  the  midst,  between  the  South-east  and  the  South. %0aLast  of  all,  between  the  South  and  the  South-west,  Lybo- %0anotus,  just  in  the  midst,  compounded  of  them  both,  namely, %0abetween  the  Meridian  and  the  Sun-setting  in  Winter.  But %0ahere  they  did  not  end.  For  others  have  set  one  more,  called %0aMese,  between  the  North-east  Wind  Boreas  and  Ccecias:  also %0aJSuronotuSj  between  the  South  and  South-west  Winds.  Besides %0aall  these,  there  be  some  Winds  peculiar  to  every  Nation, %0aand  which  pass  not  beyond  one  certain  Region  :  as,  namely, %0aScyros  among  the  Athenians,  declining  a  little  from  Argestes; %0aa  Wind  unknown  to  other  Parts  of  Greece.  In  some  other %0aPlace  it  is  more  aloft,  and  the  same  then  is  called  Olympias %0a(as  coming  from  the  Mountain  Olympus).  But  the  usual %0aManner  of  Speech  understandeth  by  all  these  Names  Ar- %0agestes only.  Some  call  Ccecias  by  the  Name  of  Hellespontias, %0aand  give  the  same  Winds  in  sundry  Places  divers  Names. %0aIn  the  Province,  likewise,  of  Narbonne,  the  most  notorious %0aWind  is  Circius,  and  for  violence  inferior  to  none,  driving %0adirectly  before  it,  very  often,  the  Current  at  Ostia  into  the %0aLigurian  Sea.  The  same  Wind  is  not  only  unknown  in  all %0aother  Parts  of  the  Heaven,  but  reacheth  not  so  much  as  to %0aVienna,  a  City  in  the  same  Province.  As  great  and  bois- %0aterous a  Wind  as  this  is  otherwise,  yet  it  meets  with  a  Re- %0astraint before  it  come  thither,  and  is  kept  within  narrow %0aBounds  by  the  Opposition  of  a  small  Hill.  Fabianus  also %0aavoucheth,  that  the  South  Winds  enter  not  so  far  as  into %0aEgypt.  Whereby  the  Law  of  Nature  sheweth  itself  plainly, %0athat  even  Winds  have  their  Times  and  Limits  appointed. %0a%0a%0a84  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%0aTo  proceed,  then,  the  Spring  openeth  the  Sea  for  Sailors: %0ain  the  Beginning  whereof,  the  West  Winds  mitigate  the  Win- %0ater Weather  at  the  Time  when  the  Sun  is  in  the  25th  Degree %0aof  Aquarius,  and  that  is  the  sixth  Day  before  the  Ides  of %0aFebruary.  And  this  Order  holdeth  for  the  most  Part  with %0aall  other  Winds,  which  I  will  set  down  one  after  another :  so %0athat  in  every  Leap  Year  we  anticipate  and  reckon  one  Day %0asooner,  and  then  again  keep  the  same  Rule  throughout  all %0athe  four  Years  following.  Some  call  Favonius  (which  begin- %0aneth  to  blow  about  the  seventh  Day  before  the  Calends  of %0aMarch)  by  the  Name  of  Chelidonius,  upon  the  Sight  of  the %0afirst  Swallows1:  but  many  name  it  Orinthias,  coming  the %0aseventy-first  Day  after  the  shortest  Day  in  Winter ;  by  occa- %0asion of  the  coming  of  Birds :  which  Wind  bloweth  for  nine %0aDays.  Opposite  to  Favonius  is  the  Wind  which  we  called %0aSub-solanus.  Unto  this  Wind  is  attributed  the  Rising  of  the %0aVergilice,  or  Seven  Stars,  in  as  many  Degrees  of  Taurus,  six %0aDays  before  the  Ides  of  May ;  which  Time  is  a  southerly %0aConstitution  :  and  to  this  Wind  the  North  is  contrary. %0aMoreover,  in  the  hottest  Season  of  the  Summer  the  Dog-star %0aariseth,  when  the  Sun  entereth  into  the  first  Degree  of  Leo, %0awhich  commonly  is  the  fifteenth  Day  before  the  Calends  of %0aAugust.  Before  the  Rising  of  this  Star  for  eight  Days' %0aSpace,  or  thereabout,  the  North-east  Winds  blow ;  which  the %0aGreeks  call  Prodromi,  or  Forerunners.  And  two  Days  after %0ait  is  risen,  the  same  Winds  hold  still  more  stiffly  for  the %0aSpace  of  forty  Days,  which  they  name  Etesia.  The  Sun's %0a%0a1  Ovid  ("  Fasti ")  says,  on  the  day  which  is  equivalent  to  about  the %0a25th  of  February:— %0a%0a"  Fallimur  ?  an  veris  praenuntia  venit  hirundo  ? %0aEt  metuit,  nequa  versa  recurrat  hyems  ?  " %0a%0a"  Am  I  deceived  ?  is  that  the  swallow's  wing  ? %0aThat  flits  along,  the  herald  of  the  spring. %0aFearful  of  cold,  she  still  seeks  shelter  here  ; %0aAnd  dreads  that  winter  may  reclaim  the  year." %0a%0aIn  Sardinia  it  is  noted  on  the  last  day  of  the  same  month,  in  the  "  Calendar %0aof  the  Transactions  of  the  Royal  Academy  of  Brussels."  But  these  are %0aearly  appearances ;  and  in  general  this  bird  arrives  in  Italy  in  the  first %0aten  days  of  March.—  Wern.  Club. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  85 %0a%0aVapour,  redoubled  by  the  Hotness  of  that  Star,  is  thought  to %0abe  assuaged  by  them :  and  no  Winds  keep  their  set  Times %0abetter  than  they.  Next  after  them  come  the  South  Winds %0aagain,  which  are  usually  up,  until  the  Star  Arcturus  riseth, %0aand  that  is  eleven  Days  before  the  autumnal  Equinox.  With %0ait  entereth  Corns,  and  thus  Corns  beginneth  the  Autumn  ; %0aand  to  this  Vulturnus  is  contrary.  After  that  Equinox  about %0afour-and-forty  Days,  the  Vergilice  go  down  and  begin  Win- %0ater, which  Season  usually  falleth  upon  the  third  Day  before %0athe  Ides  of  November.  This  is  the  Winter  North-east  Wind, %0awhich  is  far  unlike  to  that  in  Summer,  opposite  and  contrary %0ato  Africus.  Seven  Days  before  the  Midwinter  Day,  and  as %0amuch  after,  the  Sea  is  allayed  and  calm  for  the  Sitting  and %0aHatching  of  the  Birds  Halciones1,  from  which  these  Days %0atook  the  Name  Alcionis:  the  Time  behind  belongs  to  Winter. %0aAnd  yet  these  boisterous  Seasons,  full  of  Tempests,  shut  not %0aup  the  Sea :  for  Pirates  at  first  forced  Men,  with  Peril  of %0aDeath,  to  run  headlong  upon  their  Death,  and  to  hazard %0athemselves  in  Winter  Seas ;  and  now  Covetousness  compels %0athem  to  do  the  like. %0a%0aThe  coldest  Winds  of  all  other  are  those  which,  we  said, %0ablow  from  the  North,  and  together  with  them  their  Neigh- %0abour, Corns.  These  Winds  allay  all  others,  and  drive  away %0aClouds.  Moist  Winds  are  Africus,  and  especially  the  South %0aWind  of  Italy,  called  Auster.  Men  report  also,  that  Ccecias %0ain  Pontus  gathereth  to  itself  Clouds.  Corns  and  Vulturnus %0aare  dry,  but  only  when  they  cease.  The  North-east  and  the %0aNorth  produce  Snow.  The  North  Wind  also  bringeth  Hail, %0aas  doth  Corns.  The  South  Wind  is  exceeding  hot.  Vulturnus %0aand  Favonius  be  warm.  They  also  be  drier  than  the  East : %0a%0a1  Ovid  relates  the  fable  of  the  origin  of  the  Halcyon,  or  Alcyon, %0a"  Metamorphoses,"  book  xi.  fable  10;  and  Pliny  describes  the  bird  in  his %0abook  x.  c.  32.  2Elian  also  speaks  of  it,  book  i.  c.  36  ;  and  he  describes  the %0awonders  of  the  nest,  b.  ix.  c.  17,  in  a  manner  which  the  ancients  gene- %0arally appear  to  have  regarded  as  substantially  true;  but  it  is  scarcely %0anecessary  to  remark,  that  modern  observation  has  not  corroborated  this %0abelief  in  any  particular.  In  book  xxxii.  c.  8,  Pliny  speaks  of  a  medicine %0awhich  was  supposed  to  be  prepared  from  the  nest  of  the  Alcyon,  or  King- %0afisher.— Wern.

Of  all  Winds  the  Northern %0ais  most  healthful :  the  Southern  Wind  is  noisome,  and  the %0arather  when  it  is  dry ;  haply,  because  that  when  it  is  moist %0ait  is  the  colder.  During  the  Time  that  it  bloweth,  living- %0aCreatures  are  thought  to  be  less  hungry.  The  Etesice  give %0aover  ordinarily  in  the  Night,  and  arise  at  the  third  hour  of %0athe  Day.  In  Spain  and  Asia  they  blow  from  the  East :  but %0ain  Pontus,  from  the  North  :  in  other  Quarters,  from  the %0aSouth.  They  blow  also  after  the  Midwinter,  when  they  be %0acalled  OrinthicB ;  but  those  are  more  mild,  and  continue %0afewer  Days.  Two  there  be  that  change  their  Nature  with %0atheir  Place  :  the  South  Wind  in  Africa  bringeth  fair  Weather, %0aand  the  North  Wind  there  is  cloudy.  All  Winds  keep  their %0aCourse  in  Order  for  the  more  Part,  or  else  when  one  ceaseth %0athe  contrary  beginneth.  When  some  are  laid  and  the  next %0ato  them  arise,  they  go  about  from  the  left  Hand  to  the  right, %0aaccording  to  the  Sun.  Of  their  Manner  and  Order  monthly, %0athe  fourth  Day  after  the  Change  of  the  Moon  doth  most %0acommonly  determine.  The  same  Winds  will  serve  to  sail %0acontrary  Ways,  by  means  of  setting  out  the  Sails  :  so  as  many %0aTimes  in  the  Night,  Ships  in  sailing  run  one  against  another. %0aThe  South  Wind  raiseth  greater  Billows  than  the  North :  for %0athat  the  South  Wind  ariseth  below,  from  the  Bottom  of  the %0aSea ;  the  other  descends  from  on  high.  And,  therefore,  after %0aSouthern  Winds,  Earthquakes  are  most  hurtful.  The  South %0aWind  in  the  Night  Time  is  more  boisterous,  the  Northern %0aWind  in  the  Day.  The  Winds  blowing  from  the  East  con- %0atinue longer  than  those  from  the  West.  The  Northern  Winds %0agive  over  commonly  with  an  odd  Number :  which  Observa- %0ation serveth  to  good  use  in  many  other  Parts  of  natural %0aThings,  and  therefore  the  male  Winds  are  judged  by  the  odd %0aNumber.  The  Sun  both  raiseth  and  also  allayeth  the  Winds. %0aAt  rising  and  setting  he  causeth  them  to  blow :  at  Noontide %0ahe  represseth  them  in  Summer.  And  therefore  at  Mid-day %0aor  Midnight  commonly  the  Winds  are  allayed  ;  for  both  Cold %0aand  Heat,  if  they  be  immoderate,  do  consume  them.  Also, %0aRain  doth  lay  the  Winds  :  and  most  commonly  from  thence %0athey  are  looked  for  to  blow,  where  Clouds  break  and  lay %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  87 %0a%0aopen  the  Sky.  And  Eudoxus  is  of  opinion  (if  we  list  to  ob- %0aserve the  least  Revolutions)  that  after  the  End  of  every %0afourth  Year,  not  only  all  Winds,  but,  for  the  most  Part,  other %0aTempests  and  Constitutions  of  the  Weather,  return  again  to %0athe  same  Course  as  before.  And  always  the  Lustrum1  or  Com- %0aputation of  the  five  Years,  beginneth  at  the  Leap  Year,  when %0athe  Dog-star  doth  arise.  And  thus  much  concerning  general %0aWinds. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLVIII. %0a%0aOf  Sudden  Blasts. %0a%0aNow  will  we  speak  of  sudden  Blasts :  which  being  raised %0a(as  hath  been  said  before)  by  Exhalations  of  the  Earth,  and %0acast  down  again,  in  the  meanwhile  appear  of  many  Fashions, %0aenclosed  within  a  thin  Course  of  Clouds.  For  such  as  be  wan- %0adering and  rushing  in  Manner  of  Land-floods  (as  some  Men %0awere  of  opinion,  as  we  have  shewed),  bring  forth  Thunder %0aand  Lightning.  But  if  they  come  with  a  greater  Force  and %0aViolence,  and  cleave  a  dry  Cloud  asunder,  they  breed  a %0aStorm,  which  of  the  Greeks  is  called  Ecnephias:  but  if  the %0aBreach  be  not  great,  so  that  the  Wind  be  constrained  to  re- %0avolve in  his  Descent  without  Fire,  that  is  to  say,  Lightning, %0ait  makes  a  Whirlwind  called  Typhon,  that  is  to  say,  the %0avibrated  Ecnephias.  This  snatches  with  it  a  Piece  broken %0aout  of  a  congealed  cold  Cloud,  turning  and  rolling  it  round, %0aand  with  that  Weight  inaketh  its  own  Fall  more  heavy,  and %0achangeth  from  Place  to  Place  with  a  vehement  Whirling. %0aIt  is  the  greatest  Danger  that  Sailors  have,  breaking  not %0aonly  their  Yards,  but  also  wrecking  the  very  Ships  to  twisted %0aFragments  :  and  yet  a  small  Matter  is  the  Remedy  for  it, %0anamely,  the  casting  of  Vinegar  out  against  it  as  it  cometh  ; %0awhich  is  of  very  cold  Nature.  The  same  Storm  beating  upon %0aa  Thing  is  itself  smitten  back  again  with  Violence,  and %0asnatcheth  up  whatever  it  meeteth  in  the  Way  aloft  into  the %0aSky,  carrying  it  back,  and  swallowing  it  up  on  high.

The  same,  if  it  be  more  hot  and  catching  Fire  as  it  rageth, %0ais  named  Prester;  burning  and  laying  along  whatsoever  it %0aencountereth. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XLIX. %0a%0aOther  prodigious  Kinds  of  Tempests. %0a%0aNo  Typhon  cometh  from  the  North,  nor  any  Ecnephias %0awith  Snow,  or  while  Snow  lieth  on  the  Ground.  If  this  tem- %0apestuous Wind  when  it  broke  the  Cloud,  burned  fiercely, %0ahaving  Fire  of  its  own  before,  and  catched  it  not  afterward, %0ait  is  true  Lightning;  and  diifereth  from  Prester  only  as  Flame %0afrom  a  Coal  of  Fire.  Again,  Prester  spreadeth  widely  with  a %0aFlash  ;  the  other  gathereth  into  a  Globe  with  Violence.  Vor- %0atex differeth  from  Turben  in  flying  back  :  and  as  much  as  a %0aCrash  from  a  Crack.  The  Storm  Procella  differs  from  them %0aboth  in  Breadth,  and  rather  scattereth  than  breaketh  the %0aCloud.  There  riseth  also  a  dark  Mist,  resembling  a  mon- %0astrous Beast ;  and  this  is  ever  a  terrible  Cloud  to  Sailors. %0aAnother,  likewise,  is  called  a  Pillar1,  when  the  Humour  is  so %0athick  and  congealed  that  it  standeth  compact  of  itself.  Of %0athe  same  Sort  also  is  that  Cloud  which  draweth  Water  to  it, %0aas  it  were,  into  a  long  Pipe. %0a%0aCHAPTER  L. %0aIn  what  Lands  Lightnings  fall  not. %0a%0aIK  Winter  and  Summer  seldom  are  there  any  Lightnings, %0abecause  of  contrary  Causes :  for  in  Winter  the  Air  is  con- %0adensed, and  thickened  with  a  deeper  Course  of  Clouds :  and  all %0athe  Exhalations  from  the  Earth  being  chilled  and  frozen  hard, %0aextinguish  what  fiery  Vapour  soever  otherwise  they  receive  : %0awhich  is  the  Reason  that  Scythia,  and  other  frozen  Countries %0a%0a1  The  Author  clearly  means  what,  in  modern  times,  is  denominated  a %0aWater-spout :  a  phenomenon  not  uncommon  in  the  Mediterranean  Sea, %0aand  in  other  warm  climates ;  but  exceedingly  rare,  if  at  all  occurring,  in %0anorthern  regions.  —  Wern.

And  Egypt1,  likewise, %0afrom  a  contrary  Cause,  is  exempt  from  Lightnings,  the  Rea- %0ason being  its  excessive  Heat :  for  the  hot  and  dry  Exhalations %0aof  the  Earth  gather  into  very  slender,  thin,  and  weak  Clouds. %0aBut  in  the  Spring  and  Autumn,  Lightnings  are  more  rife ; %0abecause  in  both  those  Seasons  the  Causes  as  well  of  Summer %0aas  Winter  are  corrupt.  And  this  is  the  Reason  that  Light- %0anings are  common  in  Italy ;  for  the  Air  being  more  mov- %0aable, by  Reason  of  a  milder  Winter  and  a  cloudy  Summer,  is %0aalways  of  the  Temperature  of  Spring  or  Autumn.  In  those %0aParts,  also,  of  Italy,  which  lie  off  from  the  North,  and  in- %0acline to  Warmth  (as,  namely,  in  the  Tract  about  Rome  and %0aCampania),  there  is  Lightning  in  Winter  and  Summer  alike, %0awhich  happeneth  in  no  other  Part  thereof. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LI. %0aSundry  Sorts  of  Lightnings,  and  Wonders  thereof. %0a%0aVERY  many  Kinds  of  Lightning  are  set  down  by  Authors. %0aThose  that  come  dry  burn  not,  but  only  disperse.  They  that %0acome  moist  do  not  burn,  but  blast  and  embrown.

But  though %0avery  rare,  thunder  and  lightning  are  not  unknown  in  Egypt,  at  least %0ain  modern  times.     Thevenot  mentions  a  man  who  was  killed  by  light- %0aning at  Cairo,  when  he  was  there ;  —  but  such  a  circumstance  had  never %0abeen  known  before.

Martia,  a  noble %0aLady  of  Rome,  being  great  with  Child,  was  struck  with %0aLightning :  the  Child  she  went  with  was  killed  within  her, %0aand  she  survived  without  any  Harm.  Among  the  Catiline %0aProdigies  it  is  found  upon  Record,  that  M.  Herennius  (a %0aCounsellor  of  the  incorporate  Town  Pompeianum)  was  in  a %0afair  and  clear  Day  smitten  with  Lightning. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LII. %0aOf  Observations  touching  Lightning. %0a%0aIT  is  held  in  the  Writings  of  the  ancient  Tuscans1,  that %0athere  be  nine  Gods  that  send  forth  Lightnings,  and  those %0aof  eleven  Sorts  :  for  Jupiter  (say  they)  casteth  three  at  once. %0aThe  Romans  have  observed  two  of  them,  and  no  more;  attri- %0abuting those  in  the  Day-time  to  Jupiter,  and  those  of  the %0aNight  to  Summanus  or  Pluto.  And  these  verily  be  more %0arare,  for  the  Cause  before-named ;  namely,  the  Coldness %0aof  the  Air  above.  In  Etruria,  they  suppose  that  some %0aLightnings  break  out  of  the  Earth,  which  they  call  Infera, %0aor  Infernal ;  and  such  be  made  in  Midwinter.  And  these %0athey  take  to  be  earthly,  and  of  all  most  mischievous  and  exe- %0acrable :  neither  be  those  general  and  universal  Lightnings, %0anor  proceeding  from  the  Stars,  but  from  a  very  near  and %0amore  troubled  Cause.  And  this  is  an  evident  Argument %0afor  Distinction,  that  all  such  as  fall  from  the  upper  Sky  strike %0aobliquely :  but  those  which  they  call  earthly,  smite  straight. %0aBut  the  Reason  why  these  are  thought  to  issue  from  the %0aEarth  is,  because  they  fall  from  out  of  a  Matter  nearer  to %0athe  Earth ;  forasmuch  as  they  leave  no  Marks  of  a  Stroke %0a%0a1  This  people  was  famed  for  the  study  of  prognostications  from  natural %0aappearances :  an  art  they  had  probably  derived  from  Egypt  or  Assyria, %0aand  which  the  neighbouring  nations  learned  from  them.  It  consisted  in %0aminutely  observing  every  unusual  occurrence,  and  in  deducing  thence, %0aaccording  to  rules  known  only  to  the  proper  authorities,  the  will  of  the %0agods,  or  the  indications  of  a  fixed  necessity.

Such  as  have  searched  more  closely %0ainto  these  Matters  are  of  opinion  that  these  Lightnings %0acome  from  the  Planet  Saturn,  as  the  burning  Lightning  from %0aMars;  and  with  such  Lightning  was  Volsinii  (a  very  wealthy %0aCity  of  the  Tuscans),  entirely  burnt  to  Ashes.  The  Tuscans %0acall  those  Lightnings  familiar  which  presage  the  Fortune %0aof  some  Race,  and  are  significant  during  their  whole  Life  ; %0aand  such  are  they  that  come  first  to  any  Man,  after  he  is %0anewly  entered  into  his  own  Family.  However,  their  Judg- %0ament is,  that  these  private  Lightnings  do  not  portend  for %0aabove  ten  Years :  unless  they  happen  either  upon  the  Day  of %0afirst  Marriage,  or  on  a  Birth-day.  Public  Lightnings  be  not %0aof  Force  above  thirty  Years,  except  they  chance  at  the  very %0aTime  that  Towns  or  Colonies  be  erected  and  planted. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIII. %0aOf  calling  out  Lightnings. %0a%0aIT  appeareth  upon  Record  in  Chronicles,  that  by  certain %0aSacrifices  and  Prayers1,  Lightnings  may  be  either  compelled %0a%0a1  There  are  many  proofs  of  imposture  in  these  ancient  ceremonies ;  but %0awhen  modern  science  is  able  to  produce  some  of  the  effects  ascribed  to %0athese  Etrurian  priests,  it  seems  just  to  conclude  that  they  may  have  pos- %0asessed the  secret  of  a  method  of  drawing  the  electric  fluid  from  the  sky. %0aThe  danger  attending  a  failure  in  the  requisite  proceedings,  as  in  the  case %0aof  Tullius  Hostilius,  would  necessarily  confine  the  practice  to  an  instructed %0afew ;  whose  credit  for  sanctity  would,  therefore,  be  highly  exalted.  Ovid, %0ain  his  third  book  of  the  "  Fasti,"  obscurely  intimates  the  acquaintance  of %0aNuma  with  such  arts : — %0a%0a"  Jupiter  hue  veniet,  valida  perductus  ab  arte  .  .  . %0a%0a....  quid  agant,  quae  carmina  dicant, %0aQuoque  trahant  superis  sedibus  arte  Jovem." %0a%0a"  To  thee,  by  powerful  art  compelled, %0aShall  Jupiter  approach  .  .  . %0a%0a....  And  then  they  tell %0a%0aWhat  deeds,  what  powerful  charms,  the  Man  must  use, %0aTo  draw  the  God  compell'd  from  seats  above." %0a%0aThe  secret  consisted  in  Numa's  being  a  scholar  of  Pythagoras,  and  studying %0a"  Quae  sit  rerum  Natura." %0a%0aWern.

There  is  an  ancient  Report  in %0aEtruria,  that  such  a  Lightning  was  procured  by  Entreaty, %0awhen  there  entered  into  the  City  Volsinii  (after  all  the  Terri- %0atory about  it  was  destroyed)  a  Monster,  which  they  named %0aVolta.  Also,  that  another  was  called  forth  by  P  or  senna, %0atheir  King.  Moreover,  L.  Piso  (a  Writer  of  good  Credit) %0areporteth  in  his  first  Book  of  Annals,  that  Numa  before  him %0aperformed  the  same  Act  many  a  Time :  and  when  Tullius %0aHostilius  would  have  imitated  him  (for  that  he  observed  not %0aall  the  Ceremonies  accordingly),  he  was  himself  struck  with %0aLightning.  And  for  this  Purpose,  we  have  sacred  Groves, %0aAltars,  and  Sacrifices.  And  among  the  Jupiters  surnamed %0aStatores,  Tonantes,  and  Peretrii,  we  have  heard  that  one %0aalso  was  called  Elicius.  Men's  Opinions  are  various  con- %0acerning this  Point,  and  every  Man  according  to  his  own %0aLiking.  To  believe  that  Nature  may  be  compelled,  is  a  very %0aaudacious  Opinion  :  but  it  is  as  senseless  on  the  other  Side %0ato  make  her  Benefits  of  no  effect ;  considering  that  in  the %0aInterpretation  of  Lightning,  Science  hath  thus  far  proceeded %0aas  to  foretell  when  they  will  come  at  a  prescribed  Day  :  and %0awhether  they  will  frustrate  the  Dangers  pronounced,  or %0arather  open  other  Destinies,  which  lie  hidden  in  innumerable %0apublic  and  private  Experiments  of  both  Kinds.  And  there- %0afore (since  it  hath  so  pleased  Nature)  let  some  of  these  Things %0abe  certain,  others  doubtful :  some  proved,  and  others  con- %0ademned. As  for  us,  we  will  not  omit  the  Rest  which  in %0athese  Matters  are  worth  Remembrance. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIV. %0aGeneral  Rules  of  Lightning. %0a%0aTHAT  the  Lightning  is  seen  before  the  Thunderclap  is %0aheard,  although  they  come  indeed  jointly  together,  is  cer- %0atain. And  no  Wonder,  for  Light  is  more  rapid  than  Sound. %0aAnd  yet  Nature  doth  so  modulate,  that  the  Stroke  and %0aSound  shall  accord  together.  But  when  there  is  a  Noise1, %0a%0a1  Ovid  refers  to  this  also,  as  the  popular  opinion.  But  silent  lightning %0ain  a  clear  sky  was  judged  to  be  unaccountable,  except  as  coming  from  the %0agods.  Hence  Horace,  though  disposed  to  the  doctrines  of  Epicurus,  found %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  93 %0a%0ait  is  a  Sign  of  the  Lightning  proceeding  of  some  natural %0aCause,  and  not  sent  by  some  God  :  and  yet  a  Breath  cometh %0abefore  the  Thunderbolt :  and  hereupon  it  is,  that  every  Thing %0ais  shaken  and  blasted  before  it  is  smitten  :  neither  is  any %0aMan  struck,  who  either  saw  the  Lightning  before,  or  heard %0athe  Thunderclap.  Those  Lightnings  that  are  on  the  left %0aHand  are  supposed  to  be  prosperous,  for  that  the  East  is  the %0aleft  Side  of  the  World  :  but  the  Coming  thereof  is  not  so %0amuch  regarded  as  the  Return  :  whether  it  be  that  the  Fire %0aleap  back  after  the  Stroke  given ;  or  whether  after  the  Deed %0adone  and  Fire  spent,  the  Spirit  abovesaid  retire  back  again. %0aIn  that  respect  the  Tuscans  have  divided  the  Heaven  into %0asixteen  Parts.  The  first  is  from  the  North  to  the  Sun's %0aRising  in  the  Equinoctial  Line  :  the  second,  to  the  Meridian %0aLine,  or  the  South :  the  third,  to  the  Sun-setting  in  the %0aEquinoctial :  and  the  fourth  taketh  up  all  the  Rest  from  the %0asaid  West  to  the  North  Star.  These  Quarters  again  they %0ahave  parted  each  into  four  Regions :  of  which  eight  from  the %0aSun-rising  they  called  the  Left ;  and  as  many  again  from %0athe  contrary  Part,  the  Right.  Those  Lightnings  are  most %0adreadful  which  from  the  Sun-setting  reach  into  the  North : %0aand  therefore  it  is  of  much  importance  from  whence  Light- %0anings come,  and  whither  they  go :  the  best  Thing  observed %0ain  them,  is  when  they  return  into  the  easterly  Parts.  And, %0atherefore,  when  they  come  from  that  principal  Part  of  the %0aSky,  and  return  again  into  the  same,  it  portends  the  highest %0aGood  :  and  such  was  the  Sign  given  (by  report)  to  Sylla %0athe  Dictator.  In  all  other  Parts  of  the  World,  they  be  less %0afortunate  or  dreadful.  They  believe  that  there  be  Light- %0anings, which  to  utter  abroad  is  held  unlawful ;  as  also  is  to %0agive  Ear  unto  them,  unless  they  be  declared  either  to  Parents %0aor  to  a  Friend.  How  great  is  the  Folly  of  this  Observation %0awas  found  at  Rome  upon  the  blasting  of  Juno's  Temple  by %0aScaurus,  the  Consul,  who  soon  after  was  President  of  the %0aSenate.

Ovid, %0aby  poetic  license,  accumulates  all  the  bad  omens  on  record  or  in  tradition, %0ahi  the  alarming  prognostications  of  the  death  of  Julius  Caesar  ("  Meta- %0amorphoses," b.  xv.) ;  and  it  may  be  a  principal  reason  why  Pliny  specifies %0athe  times  of  these  occurrences,  to  shew  that  Ovid's  narrative  is  only  a %0apoetic  fiction. %0a%0aThe  following  translation  of  a  paragraph  in  the  "  Museum  Wormi- %0aanum"  (p.  17,  De  Terris  Miracvlusis),  is  a  specimen  of  the  manner  in %0awhich  such  extraordinary  events  were  regarded,  even  at  a  very  modern %0adate  : — "  In  the  year  1619,  when  the  preposterous  fashion  of  neck-bands, %0akerchiefs,  and  other  female  ornaments  of  linen,  dyed  of  cerulean  blue,  in- %0avaded Denmark,  and  in  spite  of  the  remonstrances  of  the  ministers  of %0aGod  obstinately  persisted,  by  adding  pride  to  luxury,  Almighty  God, %0athat  he  might  by  all  means  declare  how  abhorrent  this  sin  was  to  him, %0aand  recall  mortals  to  repentance  by  a  miracle,  in  many  places  of  Scania %0arained  down  abundantly  a  kind  of  earth  of  a  blue  colour,  very  similar %0ato  a  sort  sold  by  the  dealers  in  spices.

At  the  Time  that  the  same %0aMito  pleaded  his  own  Cause  at  the  Bar,  there  fell  a  Rain  of %0aTiles  and  Bricks,  as  is  related  in  the  Records  of  that  Year. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LVII. %0a%0aOf  the  Rustling  of  Armour,  and  the  Sound  of  Trumpets  heard %0afrom  Heaven. %0a%0aIN  the  Time  of  the  Cimbrian  Wars,  we  have  been  told %0athat  Armour  was  heard  to  rustle,  and  the  Trumpet  to  sound, %0aout  of  Heaven.  And  this  happened  very  often,  both  before %0aand  after  those  Wars.  But  in  the  third  Consulship  of %0aMarius,  the  Amerines  and  Tudertes  saw  Men  in  Arms  in  the %0aSky1,  rushing  one  against  another,  from  the  East  and  West ; %0aand  those  of  the  West  were  discomfited.

The  account  of  what  was  seen %0ain  the  county  of  Cumberland,  immediately  preceding  the  invasion  of %0aEngland  by  the  Pretender,  will  shew  how  nearly  aerial  appearances  may %0aapproach  to  realities. — Wern.

Which  if  any  Man  believe  that  it %0awas  fore-signified,  he  must  needs  also  confess,  that  this  fore- %0atelling by  Anaxagoras  was  more  miraculous  than  the  Thing %0aitself:  and  that  it  destroyed  the  Knowledge  of  Nature's %0aWorks,  and  confounds  all  Things,  if  we  should  believe  that %0aeither  the  Sun  were  a  Stone,  or  that  ever  any  Stone  were  in %0ait.  But,  that  Stones  fall  often,  no  Man  will  make  any  doubt- %0aIn  the  public  Place  of  Exercise  in  Abydos,  there  is  one  at %0athis  Day  upon  the  same  Cause  preserved,  and  held  in  great %0aReverence  :  it  is  but  of  small  size,  yet  it  is  reported  to  be  the %0asame  that  Anaxagoras  foretold  to  be  about  to  fall  in  the %0amidst  of  the  Earth.  There  is  one  revered  also  at  Cassandria, %0awhich  was  called  Potidsea,  a  Colony  from  thence  deducted. %0aI  myself  have  seen  another  in  the  Territory  of  the  Vocantians, %0awhich  was  brought  thither  but  a  little  before. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LIX. %0aOf  the  Rainbow. %0a%0aTHOSE  which  we  call  Rainbows,  are  seen  often  without  any %0aWonder,  or  betokening  Portent :  for  they  foretel  not  so  much %0a%0afacts  are  no  longer  doubted,  the  instances  recorded  by  Pliny  become %0avaluable  evidences  of  their  antiquity.  A  still  more  ancient  instance  is %0afound  in  the  Book  of  Joshua,  x.  11,  where,  in  the  conquest  of  Canaan, %0athe  Lord  threw  down  great  stones  from  heaven  on  the  enemy,  and  dis- %0acomfited them.  The  miraculous  nature  of  this  last  transaction  does  not %0aremove  it  from  the  class  of  natural  occurrences ;  for  Nature  itself  is  only %0aan  instrument  in  the  hands  of  its  Creator.  With  regard  to  the  prognos- %0atication of  Anaxagoras,  it  can  only  be  taken  to  signify  the  high  reputation %0aof  this  philosopber ;  which  led  the  public  to  believe  that  they  could  not %0aattribute  too  much  to  his  insight  into  the  occurrences  of  Nature.  There %0ais  reason  to  suppose  that  some  of  the  images  which  were  said  to  have  fallen %0adown  from  Jupiter  (Acts  of  the  Apostles,  xix.  35)  were  derived  from  tbis %0asource. —  Wern.

Certainly,  they  never %0aare  known  but  opposite  to  the  Sun  ;  nor  at  any  Time  other- %0awise than  in  Form  of  a  Semicircle ;  nor  yet  in  the  Night %0aSeason,  although  Aristotle  saith1  there  was  a  Rainbow  seen %0aby  Night :  however  he  confesseth,  that  it  could  not  possibly %0abe  but  at  the  full  of  the  Moon.  They  happen  for  the  most %0aPart  in  Winter,  chiefly  from  the  Autumnal  Equinox,  as  the %0aDays  decrease.  But  as  Days  grow  longer  after  the  Spring %0aEquinox,  they  be  not  seen,  no  more  than  about  the  Summer %0aSolstice,  when  the  Days  are  longest.  But  in  Bruma,  that  is %0ato  say,  when  they  be  shortest,  they  appear  often.  The  same %0aappear  aloft  when  the  Sun  is  low  ;  and  below,  when  he  is %0aaloft.  Also,  they  be  of  narrower  Compass  when  the  Sun %0aeither  riseth  or  setteth,  but  their  Body  spreadeth  broad  :  and %0aat  Noon  they  are  narrower,  but  wider  in  Circumference.  In %0aSummer  they  be  not  seen  about  Noon,  but  after  the  Autumnal %0aEquinox  at  all  hours ;  and  never  more  than  two  at  once. %0aThe  Rest  of  the  same  Nature,  I  see  few  Men  do  make  any %0adoubt  of. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LX. %0aOf  Hail ,  Snow,  Frost,  Mist,  and  Dew. %0a%0aHAIL  is  formed  of  Rain,  congealed  into  Ice :  and  Snow %0aof  the  same  Humour  grown  together,  but  not  so  hard.

For  like  as  the  Heaven  is  the %0a%0a1  The  earth  was  so  commonly  termed  Mother  by  Greek  and  Roman %0awriters,  in  prose  and  verse,  that  it  is  unnecessary  to  refer  to  particular  in- %0astances. And  it  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  merely  a  poetic  metaphor  or %0aidle  declamation,  for  it  was  their  belief  that  the  earliest  origin  of  mankind %0awas  from  the  ground,  by  an  inherent  property ;  as  explained  by  Lucre- %0atius in  his  Second  Book  on  the  "  Nature  of  Things : "  so  that  each  primi- %0ative nation  arose  from  its  own  soil.  And  even  the  renewal  of  the  earth %0awith  inhabitants  after  the  flood,  from  the  stones  cast  by  Deucalion  and %0aPyrrha,  was  not  popularly  regarded  as  a  fable ;  although  it  is  probable %0athat  a  mystical  meaning  was  also  supposed  to  be  couched  in  the  narrative. %0aBut  by  Pliny  this  idea  of  maternity  was  extended  more  widely  through %0ahis  adoption  of  the  Pythagorean  notion  of  the  earth's  being  a  living %0a%0a%0a100  History  of  Nature.

With  Iron  Tools,  with  Wood,  Fire,  Stone,  Burthens %0aof  Corn,  she  is  tormented  every  Hour :  and  all  this  much %0amore  for  our  Pleasures  than  to  serve  us  with  Food  and %0aNecessaries.  And  yet  these  Misusages  which  she  abideth %0aabove,  and  in  her  outward  Skin,  may  seem  in  some  Sort %0atolerable.  But  we  pierce  into  her  very  Bowels  in  search  of %0aVeins  of  Gold  and  Silver,  Copper  and  Lead.  And  to  seek %0aout  Gems  and  some  little  Stones,  we  sink  Pits  deep  in  the %0aGround.  Thus  we  pluck  the  very  Bowels  from  her  to  wear %0aon  our  Finger  one  Gem  to  fulfil  our  Pleasure,  How  many %0aHands  are  worn  with  digging,  that  one  Joint  of  our  Finger %0amay  shine !  Surely,  if  there  were  any  infernal  Spirits  be- %0aneath, ere  this  Time  these  Mines  (to  feed  Covetousness  and %0aLuxury)  would  have  brought  them  above  Ground.  Do  we %0awonder,  then,  if  she  hath  brought  forth  some  Things  hurt- %0aful ?  But  savage  Beasts  (I  think)  preserve  her ;  they  keep %0asacrilegious  Hands  from  doing  her  Injury.  Dig  we  not %0aamongst  Dragons  and  Serpents  ?  and,  together  with  Veins  of %0aGold,  handle  we  not  the  Roots  of  poisonous  Herbs  ?  Never- %0atheless, this  Goddess  we  find  the  more  appeased  for  all  this %0aMisusage,  because  the  End  of  all  this  Wealth  tendeth  to %0aWickedness,  to  Murders,  and  Wars,  and  her  whom  we %0adrench  with  our  Blood,  we  cover  also  with  unburied  Bones. %0aWhich,  nevertheless,  as  if  she  did  reproach  us  for  this  Fury, %0ashe  herself  covereth  in  the  End,  and  hideth  even  the  Wick- %0aedness of  Mortals.  Among  other  Imputations  of  an  un- %0athankful Mind,  I  may  allege  this  also,  that  we  be  ignorant %0aof  her  Nature. %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  103 %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXIV. %0aOf  the  Form  of  the  Earth. %0a%0aTHE  first  Thing  that  offereth  itself  to  be  considered,  is %0aher  Figure,  in  which  by  a  general  Consent  we  all  agree. %0aFor  surely  we  utter  nothing  more  commonly  than  the  round %0aBall1  of  the  Earth  ;  and  confess  that  it  is  a  Globe  enclosed %0awithin  two  Poles.  But  yet  the  Form  is  not  that  of  a  perfect %0aGlobe,  considering  so  great  Height  of  Mountains,  and  such %0aExtent  of  Plains;  nevertheless,  if  the  Compass  thereof  might %0abe  taken  by  Lines,  the  End  of  those  Lines  would  meet  just %0ain  Circuit,  and  prove  the  Figure  to  be  an  accurate  Circle. %0aAnd  this  the  very  Consideration  of  natural  Reason  doth %0aconvince,  although  there  were  not  those  Causes  which  we %0aalleged  about  the  Heaven.  For  in  it  the  hollow  Convexity %0adeclineth  upon  itself,  and  on  every  Side  resteth  upon  the %0aCentre  thereof,  which  is  that  of  the  Earth.  But  this  being %0asolid  and  compact,  ariseth  as  if  it  swelled,  and  is  stretched %0awithout.  The  Heaven  inclineth  toward  the  Centre,  but  the %0aEarth  goeth  from  the  Centre ;  whilst  the  World,  with  con- %0atinual Volubility  and  turning  about  it,  driveth  the  huge %0aGlobe  thereof  into  the  Form  of  a  round  Ball. %0a%0a1  The  Egyptian  Cosmogony,  as  delivered  by  Diodorus  Siculus,  de- %0ascribes the  earth  as  "rolled  within  itself,  and  turned  continually;"  although %0aa  subsequent  idea  was  founded  on  its  being  merely  an  extended  surface, %0awhere  the  earth  was  inclosed  within  a  field  of  waters,  which  was  again %0aencompassed  with  darkness  and  impenetrable  mist.  But  after  what %0aPliny  has  said  in  this,  and  the  immediately  following  chapters,  on  the %0aform  of  the  earth,  and  the  proofs  he  has  given  of  its  being  a  globe,  it %0aseems  surprising  that  a  contrary  opinion  should  have  prevailed,  even  to %0acomparatively  modern  times;  and  especially  among  men  accustomed  to %0aregard  every  thing  delivered  by  the  ancients  as  unquestionably  true.  This %0aperversity  can  only  be  accounted  for  by  having  made  a  religious  dogma %0aof  the  contrary  idea,  on  the  authority  of  some  ill-understood  passages  of %0aScripture.—  Wern.

Also  of  the %0aRoundness  of  Water. %0a%0aTHERE  is  here  great  Debate  between  learned  Men ;  and %0acontrariwise  of  the  ignorant  Multitude  :  for  they  hold,  that %0aMen  are  overspread  on  all  Parts  upon  the  Earth,  and  stand %0aone  against  another,  Foot  to  Foot :  also  that  the  Summit  of %0athe  Heaven  is  alike  unto  all :  and  in  what  Part  soever  Men %0abe,  they  still  tread  after  the  same  Manner  in  the  midst.  But %0athe  common  Sort  ask,  How,  then,  it  happeneth,  that  they %0awho  are  opposite  against  us,  do  not  fall  into  Heaven  ?  as  if %0athere  were  not  a  Reason  also  ready,  That  the  Antipodes %0aagain  should  wonder  why  we  also  fell  not  off?  Now  there  is %0aReason  that  cometh  between,  carrying  a  Probability  with  it, %0aeven  to  the  untaught  Multitude,  that  in  a  Globe  of  the  Earth, %0awith  many  Ascents,  as  if  its  Figure  resembled  a  Nut  of  the %0aPine  Tree;  yet,  nevertheless,  it  may  be  well  inhabited  in %0aevery  Place.  But  what  Good  doth  all  this,  when  another %0agreat  Wonder  ariseth  ?  namely,  that  itself  hangeth,  and %0afalleth  not  with  us:  as  if  the  Power  of  that  Spirit1  especially %0aenclosed  in  the  World  were  doubted:  or  that  any  Thing %0acould  fall  when  Nature  is  repugnant  thereto,  and  affordeth %0ano  Place  whither  to  fall :  for  as  there  is  no  Seat  of  Fire,  but %0ain  Fire ;  of  Water,  but  in  Water ;  of  Air  and  Spirit,  but  in %0aAir ;  even  so  there  is  no  Room  for  Earth  but  in  Earth,  see- %0aing all  the  Elements  besides  are  ready  to  repel  it  from  them. %0aNevertheless,  it  is  wonderful  still  how  it  should  become  a %0aGlobe,  considering  so  great  Flatness  of  Plains  and  Seas.  Of %0awhich  Opinion,  Dicearchus  (a  Man  of  the  first  Rank  in %0aLearning,)  is  a  Favourer  ;  who,  to  satisfy  the  curious  Inquiry %0aof  Kings,  had  a  Commission  to  take  the  Measure  of  Moun- %0atains :  of  which  he  said  that  Pelion,  the  highest,  was  a  Mile- %0aand-a-half  high  by  the  Plumb-line;  and  collected  thereby, %0a%0a1  What  we  now  know  to  arise  from  the  power  of  gravity,  Pliny  as- %0acribes to  the  Anima  Mundi,  or  vivifying  effect  of  the  soul  of  the  world ; %0awith  him,  an  answer  to  all  difficulties.— Wern.

But  to  me  this  was  an %0auncertain  Guess  of  his,  since  I  am  not  ignorant  that  certain %0aTops  of  the  Alps,  for  a  long  Tract,  arise  not  under  fifty  Miles %0ain  Height. %0a%0aBut  this  is  it  that  the  common  People  resist  the  most,  if %0athey  should  be  forced  to  believe  that  the  Form  of  Water  also %0agathereth  itself  round  at  the  Top.  And  yet  there  is  Nothing %0ain  the  Nature  of  Things  more  evident  to  the  Sight ;  for  the %0aDrops  every  where,  not  only  as  they  hang,  appear  like  little %0around  Balls ;  but  also  if  they  light  upon  Dust,  or  rest  upon %0athe  Down  of  Leaves,  we  see  them  keep  a  perfect  Roundness. %0aAlso  in  Cups  that  are  filled  brimful,  the  middle  Part  in  the %0aTop  swelleth  most.  Which  Things,  considering  the  Thinness %0aof  the  Fluid,  and  its  Softness  settling  upon  itself,  are  sooner %0afound  out  by  Reason  than  the  Eye.  And  this  is  more  won- %0aderful, that  when  Cups  are  filled  to  the  full,  if  a  very  little %0amore  Liquor  be  added,  the  overplus  will  run  over  all  about : %0abut  it  falleth  out  the  contrary,  if  you  put  in  any  solid %0aWeights,  even  if  it  were  to  the  Weight  of  Twenty  Denarii. %0aThe  Reason  is,  that  Things  received  within,  lift  up  the  Li- %0aquor aloft  to  the  Top,  but  poured  upon  the  Tumour  that %0abeareth  aloft  above  the  Edges,  it  must  needs  glide  off.  The %0asame  is  the  Reason  why  the  Land  cannot  be  seen  by  them %0athat  stand  on  the  Deck  of  a  Ship,  but  very  plainly  at  the %0asame  time  from  the  Top  of  the  Masts.  Also  as  a  Ship  goeth %0aoff  from  the  Land,  if  any  Thing  that  shineth  be  fastened  on %0athe  Top  of  the  Mast,  it  seemeth  to  go  down  into  the  Sea  by %0alittle  and  little,  until  at  last  it  is  hidden  entirely.

And  this  also  cometh  to  be  a  Wonder  how  it  happeneth, %0aalthough  the  Sea  grow  to  be  round,  that  the  utmost  Edge %0athereof  falleth  not  down  ?  Against  which,  if  that  the  Seas %0awere  plain,  and  of  the  Form  they  seem  to  be,  the  Greek %0aPhilosophers,  to  their  own  great  Joy  and  Glory,  prove  by %0ageometrical  Demonstration,  that  it  cannot  possibly  be  that %0athe  Water  should  fall.

[BOOK  II. %0a%0afrom  above  to  the  lower  Parts,  and  that  all  Men  confess  that %0athis  is  their  Nature,  and  no  Man  doubteth  that  the  Water  of %0athe  Sea  hath  always  come  on  any  Shore  so  far  as  the  Sloping %0awould  have  suffered :  doubtless  it  appeareth,  that  the  lower %0aa  Thing  is,  the  nearer  it  is  to  the  Centre ;  and  that  all  the %0aLines  which  from  thence  are  sent  out  to  the  next  Waters,  are %0ashorter  than  those  which  from  the  first  Waters  reach  to  the %0autmost  Extremity  of  the  Sea.  Hereupon  the  whole  Water, %0afrom  every  Part  thereof,  bendeth  to  the  Centre,  and  there- %0afore falleth  not  away,  because  it  inclineth  naturally  to  the %0ainner  Parts.  And  this  we  must  believe,  that  Nature,  the %0aWork-mistress,  framed  it  so  :  to  the  End  that  the  Earth, %0awhich  being  dry  could  not  by  itself,  without  some  Moisture, %0akeep  any  Consistence ;  and  the  Fluid,  likewise,  which  could %0anot  abide,  unless  the  Earth  upheld  it,  might  mutually  em- %0abrace one  another  ;  the  one  opening  all  the  Creeks,  and  the %0aother  running  wholly  into  the  other,  by  the  Means  of  secret %0aVeins  within,  without,  and  above,  like  Bands  to  clasp  it ; %0ayea,  and  so  break  out  at  the  Tops  of  the  Hills :  whither %0abeing  partly  carried  by  a  Spirit,  and  partly  expressed  by  the %0aWeight  of  the  Earth,  it  mounteth,  as  it  were,  in  Pipes :  and %0aso  far  is  it  from  Danger  of  falling  away,  that  it  leapeth  up %0ato  the  highest  and  loftiest  Things.  By  which  Reason  it  is %0aevident,  why  the  Seas  do  not  increase,  although  so  many %0aRivers  daily  run  into  them. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXVI. %0aHow  the  Water  is  united  to  the  Earth. %0a%0aTHE  Earth,  therefore,  in  its  whole  Globe,  is  in  the  midst %0athereof  hemmed  in  with  the  Sea,  that  flows  round  about  it. %0aAnd  this  needeth  not  to  be  sought  out  by  Argument,  for  it  is %0aknown  already  by  Experience. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXVII. %0aNavigation  upon  the  Sea  and  great  Rivers. %0a%0aFROM  Gades  and  the  Pillars  of  Hercules,  the  whole  of  the %0aWest  Sea  is  at  this  Day  sailed  over  in  the  whole  Compass  of %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  107 %0a%0aSpain  and  France.  But  the  North  Ocean  was  for  the  most %0aPart  discovered,  under  the  Conduct  of  Divus  Augustus %0aCasar1,  who,  with  a  Fleet,  compassed  Germany,  and  as  far %0aas  to  the  Cape  of  the  Cimbrians :  and  from  thence  having %0aviewed  the  vast  Sea,  or  taken  Knowledge  thereof  by  Report, %0ahe  passed  to  the  Scythian  Climate  and  those  cold  Coasts %0aabounding  with  too  much  Moisture.  For  which  Cause  tKere %0ais  no  likelihood,  that  in  those  Parts  the  Seas  are  at  an  End, %0awhere  the  Power  of  Moisture  predominates.  And  near  it, %0afrom  the  East,  out  of  the  Indian  Sea,  that  whole  Part  under %0athe  same  Clime  which  bendeth  toward  the  Caspian  Sea,  was %0asailed  throughout  by  the  Macedonian  Armies,  when  Seleucus %0aand  Antiochus  reigned,  who  commanded  that  Seleucida %0aand  Antiochida  should  bear  their  Names.  About  the  Caspian %0aSea,  also,  many  Coasts  of  the  Ocean  have  been  discovered ; %0aand  by  Piecemeal,  rather  than  all  at  once,  the  North  of  one %0aSide  or  other  hath  been  sailed  or  rowed  over.  But  to  put %0aall  out  of  Conjecture,  there  is  a  great  Argument  collected  by %0athe  Palus  Maeotis,  whether  it  be  a  Gulf  of  that  Ocean  (as %0amany  have  believed)  or  an  overflowing  of  the  same,  divided %0afrom  it  by  a  narrow  Piece  of  the  Continent.  In  another  Side %0aof  Gades,  from  the  same,  West,  a  great  Part  of  the  South %0aGulf,  round  about  Mauritania,  is  at  this  Day  sailed.  And, %0aindeed,  the  greater  Part  of  it,  as  well  as  of  the  East,  also  the %0aVictories  of  Alexander  the  Great  encompassed  on  every  Side, %0aas  far  as  to  the  Arabian  Gulf.  Wherein,  when  Cams  Ccesar %0athe  son  of  Augustus  warred  in  those  Parts,  the  Marks  are %0areported  to  have  been  seen  remaining  from  the  Spaniards' %0aShipwreck.  Hanno,  likewise,  in  the  Time  that  the  Power  of %0aCarthage  flourished,  sailed  round  from  Gades  to  the  utmost %0aBounds  of  Arabia2,  and  set  down  that  Voyage  in  Writing : %0a%0a1  This  can  only  refer  to  an  expedition,  mentioned  by  Suetonius  in  his %0alife  of  the  Emperor  Claudius,  of  Drusus,  the  son  of  Livia ;  who,  while %0acommanding  in  the  Rhetian  and  German  wars,  was  the  first  of  the  Romans %0athat  navigated  the  Northern  Ocean. —  Wem.

"  For %0aLibya  is  clearly  surrounded  by  the  sea,  except  so  much  of  it  as  borders  on %0aAsia ;  this,  Neco,  king  of  the  Egyptians,  was  the  first  we  know  of  to %0ademonstrate.

In  the  fourteenth  book  of  the  "  Odys- %0asey," Ulysses  represents  himself  as  having  narrowly  escaped  a  snare  of  this %0akind;  and  as  the  whole  narrative  is  an  artful  fiction,  intended  to  have %0athe  appearance  of  truth  to  an  Ithacan  peasant,  the  practice  of  kidnapping %0aslaves  could  not  then  have  appeared  incredible  to  any  inhabitant  of  that %0aisland : — %0a%0a"  A  false  Phoenician,  of  insidious  mind, %0aVersed  in  vile  arts,  and  foe  to  humankind, %0aWith  semblance  fair  invites  me  to  his  home ; %0aI  seized  the  proffer  (ever  fond  to  roam)  : %0aDomestic  in  his  faithless  roof  I  stay'd, %0aTill  the  swift  sun  his  annual  circle  made. %0aTo  Libya  then  he  meditates  the  way ; %0aWith  guileful  art  a  stranger  to  betray, %0aAnd  sell  to  bondage  in  a  foreign  land : %0aMuch  doubting,  yet  compell'd,  I  quit  the  strand. %0a*  *  *  *  * %0a%0a*  *    but  Jove's  intent %0a%0aWas  yet  to  save  the  oppress'd  and  innocent." — POPE. %0a%0aTacitus  ("Agricola,"  cap.  xxviii.)  mentions  an  instance  of  shipwrecked %0apersons  having  been  treated  as  pirates,  and  sold  into  slavery.

Surely  the  possession  of  so  vast  a  Mass %0amust  be  excessive  and  infinite.  Add  to  this,  that  of  that %0awhich  is  left,  the  Heaven  hath  taken  away  the  greater  Part. %0aFor  whereas  there  be  of  the  Heaven  five  Parts,  which  they %0a%0abold  singularity  of  their  voyage.  —  See  the  "  Agricola  "  of  Tacitus,  cap. %0axxviii.,  translated  by  Murphy. %0a%0aIt  would  even  appear  that  such  distressed  strangers  were  deemed  a %0aproper  sacrifice  to  the  gods :  Herodotus  reports  it  as  a  tradition  (book  ii.) %0athat  when  Hercules,  in  his  journeyings,  arrived  in  Egypt,  the  Egyptians %0acrowned  him  with  a  garland,  and  designed  to  sacrifice  him  to  Jupiter,  if %0ahe  had  not  delivered  himself  by  his  great  strength.  The  objection  of  the %0ahistorian  to  this  story,  on  the  ground  of  the  unbloody  sacrifices  of  the %0aEgyptians,  is  sufficiently  answered  by  the  fact  that  they  were  in  the  habit %0aof  sacrificing  red-haired  men  to  their  evil  deity.  Again,  in  his  fourth  book, %0ahe  says,  that  the  Taurians,  a  people  of  Scythia,  were  accustomed  to  sacrifice %0ato  a  virgin  all  strangers  that  suffered  shipwreck  on  their  coast,  and  all %0aGrecian  sailors  they  were  able  to  seize.  The  people  of  Israel,  on  the  con- %0atrary, were  commanded  by  their  law  kindly  to  welcome  strangers;  for %0athey  themselves  had  been  strangers  in  a  foreign  land. —  Wern.

Hence  the  ignorance  of  geography  manifested  by  Pliny %0aand  other  writers,  long  after  these  celebrated  voyagers  had  effected  the %0acircumnavigation  of  Africa.     Polybius,  whose  history  was  written  about %0a150  years  B.  c.,  and  who  was  particularly  distinguished  by  his  attention %0ato  geographical  researches,  affirms  that  it  was  not  known,  in  his  time, %0awhether  Africa  was  a  continued  continent  stretching  to  the  south,  or %0awhether  it  was  encompassed  by  the  sea.     Strabo  mentions,  indeed,  the %0avoyage  of  Eudoxus,  but  treats  it  as  a  fabulous  tale :  and  Ptolemy,  the %0amost  inquisitive  and  learned  of  all  the  ancient  geographers,  was  equally %0aunacquainted  with  any  parts  of  Africa  situated  a  few  degrees  beyond  the %0aEquinoctial  Line ;  for  he  supposes  that  this  great  continent  was  not %0asurrounded  by  the  sea,  but  that  it  stretched,  without  interruption,  to- %0awards the  South  Pole ;  and  he  so  far  mistakes  its  true  figure,  that  he %0adescribes  it  as  becoming  broader  and  broader  as  it  advances  towards  the %0aSouth. %0a%0aThe  notion  of  the  ancients  concerning  such  an  excessive  degree  of  heat %0ain  the  Torrid  Zone  as  rendered  it  uninhabitable,  and  their  persisting  in %0athis  error  long  after  they  began  to  have  some  commercial  intercourse  with %0aseveral  parts  of  India  lying  within  the  Tropics,  is  very  extraordinary. %0aPliny,  in  this  chapter,  falls  in  with  both  these  errors  :  and  Cicero  ("  Som- %0anium  Scipionis")  holds  the  same  opinion, — and  other  authorities  might  be %0aadduced. — See  the  Notes  to  Robertson's  "  History  of  America,"  where  he %0aattempts  to  account  for  the  apparent  inconsistency  of  the  ancients  with %0arespect  to  their  theory  and  experience. — Wern.

For,  unless  it  were  in  the %0amidst,  the  Instruments  called  Dioptrce  have  proved  that %0aNights  and  Days  could  not  be  found  equal :  and  those  In- %0astruments, above  all  other,  confirm  the  same  :  seeing  that  in %0athe  Equinox,  by  the  same  Line,  both  Rising  and  Setting  of %0athe  Sun  are  seen  ;  but  the  Summer  Sun  rising,  and  the  Win- %0ater setting,  by  their  own  several  Lines.  Which  could  by  no %0ameans  happen  if  the  Earth  resteth  not  in  the  Centre. %0a%0a« %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXX. %0a%0aOf  the  Unequal  Rising  of  the  Stars:  of  the  Eclipse,  both %0awhere  and  how  it  cometh. %0a%0aTHERE  are  three  Circles  closed  within  the  Zones  afore- %0anamed, which  distinguish  the  Inequalities  of  the  Days : %0awhich  are,  the  (Summer)  Solstitial  Tropic,  from  the  highest %0aPart  of  the  Zodiac,  in  regard  of  us,  toward  the  North  Clime  ; %0aand  against  it,  another  called  the  Winter  Tropic,  toward  the %0aSouthern  Pole  :  and  in  like  Manner  the  Equinoctial,  which %0agoeth  in  the  midst  of  the  Zodiac  Circle.  The  Cause  of  the %0arest,  which  we  wonder  at,  is  in  the  Figure  of  the  Earth  itself, %0awhich,  together  with  the  Water,  is,  by  the  same  Arguments, %0aknown  to  be  like  a  Globe :  for  so,  doubtless,  it  cometh  to %0apass,  that  with  us  the  Stars  about  the  North  Pole  never  set ; %0aand  those  contrariwise  of  the  South,  never  rise.  And  again, %0athose  which  are  here  be  not  seen  of  them,  by  Reason  that  the %0aGlobe  of  the  Earth  swelleth  up  in  the  midst  between.  Again, %0aTrogloditine,  and  Egypt  bordering  upon  it,  never  see  the %0aNorth  Pole  Stars :  neither  hath  Italy  a  Sight  of  Canopus,  or %0athat  which  they  name  Berenice's  Hair.

And  so  evidently %0abendeth  the  Convexity  of  the  Earth,  that  Canopus  at  Alex- %0aandria seemeth  to  the  Beholders  elevated  above  the  Earth %0aalmost  one-fourth  Part  of  a  Sign  ;  but  at  Rhodes,  the  same %0aappeareth  almost  to  touch  the  very  Horizon,  and  in  Pontus, %0awhere  the  Elevation  of  the  North  Pole  is  highest,  it  is  not %0aseen  at  all :  yea,  and  this  same  Pole  at  Rhodes  is  hidden, %0abut  more  in  Alexandria.  In  Arabia  it  is  all  hid  at  the  first %0aWatch  of  the  Night  in  November ;  but  at  the  second,  it  is %0avisible.  In  Meroe,  at  Midsummer,  in  the  Evening,  it  ap- %0apeareth for  a  while  ;  but  some  few  Days  before  the  Rising %0aof  Arcturus  it  is  seen  with  the  very  Dawning  of  the  Day. %0aSailors,  by  their  Voyages,  come  to  the  Knowledge  of  these %0aStars  most  of  any  other,  by  Reason  that  some  Seas  are  oppo- %0asite unto  some  Stars ;  but  others  lie  flat  and  incline  forward %0ato  others  :  so  that  also  those  Pole  Stars  appear  suddenly,  as %0arising  out  of  the  Sea,  which  lay  hidden  before  under  the %0awinding  Compass  of  a  Ball.  For  the  Heaven  (Mundus) %0ariseth  not  aloft  in  this  higher  Pole,  as  some  Men  have  said ; %0afor  if  so,  these  Stars  should  be  seen  in  every  Place  :  but  those %0athat  to  the  nearest  Observers  are  supposed  to  be  higher,  the %0asame  seem  to  them  afar  off  to  be  immersed  in  the  Sea.  And %0aas  this  North  Pole  seemeth  to  be  aloft  to  those  that  are %0asituated  directly  under  it,  so  to  them  that  be  removed  so  far %0aas  the  other  Devexity  or  Fall  of  the  Earth,  those  abovesaid %0aStars  rise  up  aloft  there,  while  these  decline  downward  which %0ahere  were  mounted  on  high.  Which  Thing  could  not  possibly %0afall  out  but  in  the  Figure  of  a  Ball.  And  hence  it  is,  that %0athe  Inhabitants  of  the  East  perceive  not  the  Eclipses  of  the %0aSun  and  Moon  in  the  Evening,  no  more  than  those  that %0adwell  West  in  the  Morning :  but  those  that  be  at  Noon  in  the %0aSouth  they  often  see.  At  the  Time  that  Alexander  the  Great %0aobtained  his  famous  Victory  at  Arbela,  it  is  said  that  the %0aMoon  was  eclipsed  at  the  second  Hour  of  the  Night :  but  this %0aEclipse  was  at  the  Time  of  her  Rising  in  Sicily.

In  Africa  and  Spain %0athere  were  raised  by  Annibal,  high  Watch-towers  :  and  in %0aAsia,  for  the  Fear  of  Pirates,  the  like  Help  of  Beacons  was %0aerected.  Wherein  it  was  observed  oftentimes,  that  the  Fires %0agiving  Warning  before  (which  were  set  on  Fire  at  the  sixth %0aHour  of  the  Day),  were  descried  by  them  that  were  farthest %0aoff  in  Asia,  at  the  third  Hour  of  the  Night.  Philonides,  the %0aCourier  of  the  same  Alexander,  despatched  in  nine  Hours  of %0athe  Day  1200  Stadia,  as  far  as  from  Sicyone  to  Elis :  and %0afrom  thence  again  (although  he  went  down  Hill  all  the  Way) %0ahe  returned  oftentimes,  but  not  before  the  third  Hour  of  the %0aNight.  The  Cause  was,  because  he  had  the  Sun  with  him  in %0ahis  Setting  out ;  and  in  his  Return  to  Sicyon  he  went  against %0ait,  and  ere  he  came  home,  left  it  in  the  West  behind.  Which %0ais  the  Reason  also,  that  they  who  by  Daylight  sail  Westward %0ain  the  shortest  Day  of  the  Year,  pass  along  more  Way  than %0athose  who  sail  all  the  Night  long  at  the  same  Time,  because %0athe  others  accompany  the  Sun. %0a%0a1  These  effects  of  longitude  are  either  greatly  exaggerated  or  untrue. %0a-—  Wem.

Which  also  at  the  same %0aTime  happeneth  in  India,  above  the  River  Hypasis,  as  Onesi- %0acritus  hath  written.

And  if  it  be  true,  as %0ait  is  reported,  of  Anaximander,  the  Milesian  Natural  Philo- %0asopher, his  Foreknowledge  of  Things  was  excellent  and  wor- %0athy of  Immortality  :  for  they  say  he  forewarned  the  Lacede- %0amonians to  look  well  to  their  City  and  Dwelling-houses,  for %0athat  an  Earthquake  approached ;  which  fell  out  accord- %0aingly :  when  not  only  their  whole  City  was  shaken,  but  also %0aa  great  Part  of  the  Mountain  Taygetus,  which  projected  like %0a%0aone ;  and  which  may  be  attended  with  tidal  and  sound  waves,  dependent %0aupon  the  former,  and  upon  circumstances  of  position  as  to  sea  and  land.— %0aMALLET  :  Transactions  of  Royal  Irish  Academy,  vol.  xix. %0a%0aThe  causes,  and  many  of  the  attending  phenomena,  are  as  much  a %0amatter  of  conjecture  now  as  when  Pliny  wrote ;  but  he  does  not  even %0adeem  worthy  of  notice  the  popular  supposition,  that  the  giants  who  had %0arebelled  against  the  gods  were  buried  beneath  these  mountains,  where %0aby  their  struggles  they  gave  occasion  to  those  commotions  :  nor  that  the %0ashop  of  Vulcan  was  beneath  Etna,  of  which  the  crater  was  the  chimney. %0aIt  is  more  remarkable  that  he  makes  no  reference  to  the  idea  of  Pytha- %0agoras (Ovid's  "  Metamorphoses,"  b.  xv.),  that  the  phenomena  of  volcanic %0aeruption  was  a  vital  action  of  the  earth,  regarded  as  an  animal ;  for  that %0athe  earth  was  such  we  find  Pliny  expressing  a  decided  opinion.  But  the %0aconcluding  explanation  of  the  poet,  however,  was  that  which  best  suited %0ahis  inquiries. %0a%0aCeremonies  concerning  Earthquakes. — Whilst  it  was  a  maxim  of  the %0astate  religion,  that  earthquakes  were  caused  by  the  displeasure  of  some %0adivinity,  it  was  still  necessary  that  each  occurrence  of  such  phenomenon %0ashould  be  fully  announced  by  the  proper  officers,  before  the  religious %0aobservances  appropriate  to  the  case  could  be  required  ;  and  thus  was  se- %0acured a  guard  against  such  alarms  as  might  agitate  the  public  mind,  if %0aany  neglect  might  seem  to  arise.  The  ceremonies  were  by  public  an- %0anouncement ;  and  they  were  so  imperative  upon  all,  that  any  one  engaging %0ain  ordinary  work  at  the  time  of  these  feriae  would  be  judged  to  have %0aviolated  them.  The  salutation  to  the  divine  power  that  may  have  caused %0athe  shock  was,  "  Si  Deo,  si  Dea,"  &c.,  to  obviate  the  danger  of  an  error %0aregarding  which  god,  or  which  sex  of  these  deities,  had  caused  the  calamity. %0aAnd  this  was  of  importance,  because  if  a  wrong  name  were  called,  so  far %0afrom  being  pacified,  the  real  author  might  become  still  more  offended. — %0aFrom  Aulus  Gellius.—  Wern.

There  is  re- %0aported another  Conjecture  byPherecydes,  who  was  the  Teacher %0aof  Pythagoras;  and  the  same  was  likewise  of  divine  character; %0afor,  by  drawing  Water  out  of  a  Well  he  both  foresaw  and %0aforetold  an  Earthquake  there.  Which,  if  they  be  true,  how %0afar  off,  I  pray  you,  may  such  Men  seem  to  be  from  God,  even %0awhile  they  live  upon  Earth  ?  But  I  leave  these  Things  free %0afor  every  Man  to  weigh  according  to  his  Judgment :  and  for %0amy  own  Part,  I  suppose  that,  without  Doubt,  the  Winds  are %0athe  proper  Cause.  For  the  Earth  never  quakes  but  when %0athe  Sea  is  still,  and  the  Weather  so  calm  that  Birds,  in  their %0aflying,  cannot  hover  in  the  Air;  because  all  the  Spirit  which %0ashould  bear  them  up,  is  withdrawn  :  nor  yet  at  any  Time,  but %0aafter  the  Winds  are  laid ;  namely,  when  the  Blast  is  hidden %0awithin  the  Veins  and  Caves  of  the  Earth.  Neither  is  this %0aShaking  in  the  Earth  any  other  Thing  than  is  Thunder  in  the %0aCloud  :  nor  the  Chasm  thereof  aught  else,  but,  like  the  Cleft %0aout  of  which  the  Lightning  breaketh,  when  the  Spirit  enclosed %0awithin  struggleth  and  stirreth  to  go  forth  at  Liberty. %0a%0aCHAPTER   LXXX. %0aOf  Chasms  of  the  Earth. %0a%0aVARIOUSLY,  therefore,  the  Earth  is  shaken,  and  thereupon %0aensue  wonderful  Effects.  In  one  Place  the  Walls  of  Cities %0aare  laid  prostrate  :  in  another  they  are  swallowed  up  in  a  deep %0aChasm  :  here  are  cast  up  mighty  Heaps  of  Earth  ;  there  are %0apoured  out  Rivers  of  Water;  sometimes  Fire  doth  burst  forth, %0aand  hot  Springs  :  and  again  the  Course  of  Rivers  is  turned %0aaway  backward.

And  in  the %0asame  Towns,  those  Parts  which  be  pendant  are  the  safer :  as %0ais  well  seen  in  Naples,  in  Italy,  where  that  Quarter  thereof %0awhich  is  solid  is  subject  to  such  Casualties.  And  in  Houses %0athe  Arches  are  most  safe,  and  the  Angles  of  Walls,  and %0athose  Posts  which,  in  shaking,  will  jog  to  and  fro  every  Way. %0aWalls  made  of  Brick  or  Earth  take  less  Harm  when  they  be %0ashaken  in  an  Earthquake.  And  a  great  Difference  there  is %0ain  the  Manner  of  Earthquakes  ;  for  the  Motion  is  after  many %0aSorts.  The  safest  is,  when  Houses  as  they  rock  keep  a  trem- %0abling and  warbling  Noise :  also  when  the  Earth  seemeth  to %0aswell  up  in  rising :  and  again  to  settle  down  with  an  alterna- %0ative Motion.  It  is  harmless,  also,  when  Houses  run  on  End %0atogether  by  a  contrary  Stroke,  and  jut  one  against  another: %0afor  the  one  Motion  doth  withstand  the  other.  The  bending %0adownward  in  Manner  of  waving,  and  a  rolling  like  to  surging %0aBillows,  is  that  which  is  so  dangerous  ;  or  when  the  whole %0a%0a1  A  consideration  of  the  fact  here  expressed  might  have  mitigated  the %0awonder  felt  by  Pliny  at  the  prognostication  of  approaching  earthquakes, %0areferred  to  in  chapter  Ixxix.

Martins  and  Sex.

It  fell  out  in  the  Daytime  :  and  between  them  there %0aissued  flaming  Fire  and  Smoke,  mounting  up  into  the  Sky : %0awhile  a  great  Number  of  Roman  Knights,  a  Multitude  of %0aServants,  and  Passers-by,  stood  and  beheld  it  from  the  Mml- %0alian  Way.  With  this  Conflict  all  the  Villages  upon  them %0awere  dashed  in  Pieces  ;  and  very  much  Cattle  that  was %0awithin  died  therewith.  And  this  happened  the  Year  before %0athe  social  War ;  which  I  doubt  whether  it  were  not  more %0apernicious  to  the  Land  of  Italy  than  the  Civil  Wars.  That  was %0ano  less  wonderful  a  Prodigy,  which  was  known  also  in  our %0aAge,  in  the  last  Year  of  Nero  the  Emperor  (as  we  have  shewn %0ain  his  Acts),  when  Meadows  and  Olive-rows  (notwithstanding %0athe  great  public  Road  lay  between)  passed  across  into  one %0aanother's  Place,  in  the  Marrucine  Territory,  within  the  Lands %0aof  Vectius  Marcellus,  a  Roman  Knight,  Procurator  under %0aNero  in  his  Affairs. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXXXIV. %0aWonders  of  Earthquakes. %0a%0aTHERE  happen  together  with  Earthquakes,  Inundations %0aof  the  Sea ;  which  is  infused  into  the  Earth  with  the  same %0aWind,  or  else  received  into  the  hollow  Receptacle  as  it  set- %0atleth  down.

But  Earthquakes  were  most  frequent %0ain  the  Punic  War,  when  within  one  Year  there  were  an- %0anounced at  Rome  seven-and-fifty l.  In  which  Year,  indeed, %0awhen  the  Carthaginians  and  Romans  fought  a  Battle  at  the %0aLake  Thrasymenus,  none  of  either  army  perceived  the  Oc- %0acurrence of  a  great  Earthquake.  Neither  is  this  a  simple %0aevil  Thing,  nor  doth  the  Danger  consist  only  in  the  Earth- %0aquake itself,  but  that  which  it  portendeth  is  as  bad  or  worse. %0aNever  did  the  City  of  Rome  experience  an  Earthquake,  but %0ait  proved  a  Warning  of  some  unhappy  Event  to  follow. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXXXV. %0aIn  what  Places  the  Seas  have  gone  back. %0a%0aTHE  same  Cause  is  to  be  rendered  of  some  new  Piece  of %0aGround,  when  the  before-named  Wind  within  the  Earth, %0aable  to  inflate  and  raise  the  Ground,  was  still  not  of  Power %0asufficient  to  break  forth  and  escape.

Thus,  she  disjoined  Sicily %0afrom  Italy,  Cyprus  from  Syria,  Euboea  from  Bceotia,  Ata- %0alante  and  Macris  from  Euboea,  Besbycus  from  Bithynia, %0aLeucostia  from  the  Promontory  of  the  Syrenes1. %0a%0aCHAPTER  LXXXIX. %0aWhat  Islands  became  joined  to  the  Main. %0a%0aAGAIN,  she  hath  taken  Islands  from  the  Sea,  and  joined %0athem  to  the  Main  Land ;  as,  for  Instance,  Antissa  to  Lesbos, %0aZephyria  to  Halicarnassus,  Aethusa  to  Myndus,  Dromiscos %0aand  Pern£  to  Miletus,  and  Narthecusa  to  the  Promontory %0aParthenius.

In  the  Peninsula  of  the  Tauri  and  City %0aParasinum,  there  is  a  kind  of  Earth  that  healeth  all  Wounds, %0aBut  about  Assos,  in  Troas,  there  grows  a  Stone  by  which  all %0aBodies  are  consumed,  and  thereupon  it  is  termed  Sarco- %0aphagus. There  be  two  Mountains  near  the  River  Indus :  the %0aNature  of  the  one  is  to  hold  fast  all  Manner  of  Iron,  and  of %0athe  other,  to  reject  it :  andr  therefore,  if  the  Sole  of  a  Man's %0aShoes  be  clouted  with  Nails,  in  the  one  of  them  a  Man  can- %0anot pluck  away  his  Foot,  and  in  the  other  he  cannot  take %0aany  footing.  It  is  noted,  that  in  Locri  and  Crotone  the  Pes- %0atilence was  never  known,  nor  any  Danger  by  Earthquake. %0aAnd  in  Lycia,  after  an  Earthquake,  it  is  fair  Weather  for %0aforty  Days.

The  Manner  thereof  is  various,  but  the  Cause %0ais  in  the  Sun  and  Moon.  Between  two  Risings  of  the  Moon %0athey  flow  twice  and  twice  go  back,  and  always  in  the  Space %0aof  four-and- twenty  Hours.  And  first  as  she  riseth  aloft %0atogether  with  the  World,  the  Tides  swell ;  and  presently %0aagain,  as  she  goeth  from  the  Height  of  the  Meridian  Line %0aand  inclineth  Westward,  they  subside  :  again,  as  she  moveth %0afrom  the  West,  under  our  Horizon,  and  approacheth  to  the %0aPoint  contrary  to  the  Meridian,  they  flow,  and  then  they  are %0areceived  back  into  the  Sea  until  she  rise  again :  and  never %0akeepeth  the  Tide  the  same  Hour  that  it  did  the  Day  before  : %0afor  it  giveth  Attendance  upon  the  Planet,  which  greedily %0adraweth  with  it  the  Seas,  and  evermore  riseth  to  Day  in  some %0aother  Place  than  it  did  yesterday.  Nevertheless,  the  Tides %0akeep  just  the  same  Times  between,  and  hold  always  six %0aHours  a-piece  :  I  mean  not  of  every  Day  and  Night  or  Place %0aindifferently,  but  only  the  Equinoctial.  For  in  regard  of %0aHours,  the  Tides  of  the  Sea  are  unequal :  forasmuch  as  by %0aDay  and  Night  the  Tides  are  more  or  less  one  Time  than %0aanother  :  in  the  Equinoctial  only  they  are  equal  in  all  Places. %0aA  powerful  Argument  this  is,  and  full  of  Light,  to  convince %0athe  Dulness  of  those  who  are  of  opinion,  that  the  Planets %0abeing  under  the  Earth  lose  their  Power :  and  that  their %0aVirtue  beginneth  when  they  are  above  only.  For  they  shew %0atheir  Effects  as  well  under  as  above  the  Earth,  as  well  as  the %0aEarth  which  worketh  in  all  Parts.  And  plain  it  is,  that  the %0aMoon  performeth  her  Operations  as  well  under  the  Earth  as %0awhen  we  see  her  visibly  above :  neither  is  her  Course  any %0aother  beneath  than  above  our  Horizon.  But  yet  the  Altera- %0ation of  the  Moon  is  manifold,  and  first  every  seven  Days: %0afor  while  she  is  new,  the  Tides  be  but  small,  until  the  first %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  \  33 %0a%0aQuarter :  and  as  she  groweth  bigger  they  flow  more,  so  that %0aat  the  full  they  swell  most  of  all.  From  that  Time  they  be- %0acome more  mild  :  and  in  the  first  Days  of  the  decrease  unto %0athe  seventh,  the  Tides  are  equal.  Again,  when  she  is  divided %0aon  the  other  Side  they  are  increased.  And  in  the  Conjunc- %0ation they  are  equal  to  the  Tides  of  the  full.  And  evidently %0ait  appeareth,  that  when  she  is  Northerly  and  removed  far- %0ather from  the  Earth,  the  Tides  are  more  gentle  than  when %0ashe  is  gone  Southerly :  for  then  she  worketh  nearer  Hand, %0aand  putteth  forth  her  full  Power.  Every  eight  Years,  also, %0aand  after  the  hundredth  Revolution  of  the  Moon,  the  Seas %0areturn  to  the  Beginning  of  their  Motions,  and  to  the  like %0aIncrease  :  by  Reason  that  she  augmenteth  all  Things  by  the %0ayearly  Course  of  the  Sun :  forasmuch  as  in  the  two  Equi- %0anoctials they  always  swell  most,  yet  more  in  that  of  the %0aAutumn  than  the  Spring  ;  but  nothing  to  speak  of  in  Mid- %0awinter, and  less  at  Midsummer.  And  yet  these  Things  fall %0anot  out  in  these  very  Instants  of  the  Times  which  I  have %0anamed,  but  some  few  Days  after ;  like  as  neither  in  the %0afull  nor  in  the  change,  but  afterward  :  nor  yet  immediately %0aas  the  Heaven  either  shevveth  us  the  Moon  in  her  rising,  or %0ahideth  her  from  us  at  her  setting,  or  as  she  declineth  from  us %0ain  the  middle  Climate,  but  later  almost  by  two  equinoctial %0aHours.  Forasmuch  as  the  Effect  of  all  Influences  in  the %0aHeaven  reach  not  so  soon  unto  the  Earth,  as  the  Eyesight %0apierceth  up  to  the  Heaven  :  as  appeareth  by  Lightnings, %0aThunders,  and  Thunderbolts.  Moreover,  all  Tides  in  the %0amain  Ocean  overspread  arid  cover  much  more  within  the  Land %0athan  in  other  Seas :  either  because  in  the  whole  it  is  more %0aviolent  than  in  a  Part :  or  for  that  the  open  Greatness  thereof %0afeeleth  more  effectually  the  Power  of  the  Planet,  working %0aforcibly  as  it  doth  widely  at  Liberty,  than  when  the  same  is %0arestrained  within  those  Straits.  Which  is  the  Cause  that %0aneither  Lakes  nor  little  Rivers  ebb  and  flow  in  like  Manner. %0aPythias  of  Massiles  writeth,  that  above  Britain  the  Tide %0afloweth  in  Height  eighty  Cubits.  But  the  more  inward  Seas %0aare  shut  up  within  the  Lands,  as  in  a  Harbour.

Yet  notwithstanding  in  many %0aEstuaries  of  the  Sea,  because  of  the  unequal  Risings  of  the %0aPlanets  in  every  Coast,  the  Tides  are  diverse,  and  disagreeing %0ain  Time ;  but  not  in  their  Cause  ;  as  particularly  in  the  Syrtes. %0aAnd  yet  some  there  be  that  have  a  peculiar  Nature  ;  as  the %0aFirth  Taurominitanum,  which  ebbeth  and  floweth  oftener %0athan  twice:  and  that  other  in  Eubcea,  called  likewise  Eu- %0anpus,  which  hath  seven  Tides  forward  and  back  in  a  Day %0aarid  Night.  And  the  same  Tide  three  Days  in  a  Month %0astandeth  still,  namely,  in  the  seventh,  eighth,  and  ninth  Days %0aof  the  Moon's  Age.  At  Gades1,  the  Fountain  near  the  Chapel %0aof  Hercules  is  enclosed  about  like  a  Well,  which  sometimes %0ariseth  and  falleth  with  the  Ocean  ;  and  at  other  Times  it %0adoth  both  at  contrary  Seasons.  In  the  same  Place  there  is %0a%0a*  Cadiz,  on  the  Atlantic  coast  of  Spain,  was  founded  in  a  very  remote %0aage  by  the  Phoenicians,  under  the  conduct  of  one  of  their  most  illustrious %0achiefs,  Melcartus ;  whose  name  is  significant  of  a  royal  race ;  and  who  has %0abeen  denominated  the  Tyrian  Hercules,  from  a  supposition  that  his %0alabours  were  somewhat  similar  to  those  of  the  son  of  Alcmena.  The  city %0awas  at  this  time  called  Gadira,  and  in  it  was  a  temple  devoted  to  this  first %0aof  celebrated  navigators,  but  retaining  the  marks  of  primitive  purity  of %0aworship,  in  having  no-  image.  (Silius  Italicus,  quoted  in  Cumberland's %0a"  Sanchoniatho.")  The  Phoenicians  were  accustomed  to  select  for  their %0acolonies  such  islands  as  this  Spanish  peninsula  then  was,  both  for  pru- %0adential and  religious  reasons ;  and  the  city  long  continued  the  centre  of %0atrade  to  the  British  islands  and  northern  regions ;  while  at  the  same  time %0ait  was  unknown  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  There  is  even  reason  to  believe, %0athat  during  the  Roman  dominion  of  Europe  an  intercourse  was  main- %0atained between  Cadiz  and  the  independent  Britons  —  scarcely  known  to %0aany  beside  the  merchants  engaged  in  it.  From  an  expression  of  Pliny  in %0achap,  cviii.  of  this  book,  it  would  appear  that  there  were  at  this  place  two %0apillars,  properly  termed  the  "Pillars  of  Hercules  :"  though  the  name  has %0asince  been  applied  to  the  mountains  at  the  entrance  of  the  Mediterranean %0aSea.—  Wern.

Of  the  same  Nature %0athere  is  one  Well  in  the  Town  Hispalis ;  while  the  Rest  be %0aas  others  are.  And  the  Sea  Pontus  evermore  floweth  out %0ainto  Propontis,  but  the  Sea  never  retireth  back  again  within %0aPontus. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XCVIII. %0a%0aWonders  of  the  Sea. %0a%0aALL  Seas  are  cleansed  at  the  full  Moon;  and  some  besides %0aat  certain  Times.  About  Messala  and  Nylse,  there  is  thrown %0aupon  the  Shore  Dregs  like  Beasts'  Dung ;  from  which  arose %0athe  Fable,  that  the  Sun's  Oxen  were  there  kept  in  Stall. %0aHereunto  addeth  Aristotle  (that  I  may  not  omit  any  Thing %0athat  I  know),  that  no  living  Creature  dieth  but  in  the  Ebb  of %0athe  Sea1.  This  is  observed  much  in  the  Ocean  of  Gaul,  but %0afound  only  in  Man  by  Experience. %0a%0aCHAPTER  XCIX. %0a%0aWhat  Power  the  Moon  hath  over  Things  on  Earth %0aand  in  the  Sea. %0a%0aBY  which  it  is  truly  guessed,  that  not  in  vain  the  Planet %0aof  the  Moon  is  supposed  to  be  a  Spirit :  for  this  is  it  that %0asaturates  the  Earth  in  her  approach,  filling  Bodies  full;  and %0ain  her  retiring  emptying  them  again2.  And  hereupon  it  is, %0a%0a1  "  I  was  not  so  curious  as  to  entitle  the  stars  upon  any  concern  of  his %0adeath,  yet  could  not  but  take  notice  that  he  died  when  the  moon  was  in %0amotion  from  the  meridian  ;  at  which  time,  an  old  Italian,  long  ago,  would %0apersuade  me  that  the  greatest  part  of  mankind  died :  but  herein  I  confess %0aI  could  never  satisfy  my  curiosity,  although  from  the  time  of  tides  in  places %0aupon  or  near  the  sea  there  may  be  considerable  deductions ;  and  Pliny  hath %0aan  odd  and  remarkable  passage  concerning  the  death  of  men  and  animals %0aupon  the  recess  or  ebb  of  the  sea.*1 — Sir  THOMAS  BROWN'S  Worhs,  by %0aWILKIN,  vol.  iv.  p.  40. —  Wem.

Thus %0athe  broad  and  spacious  Sea  hath  the  Taste  of  Salt  sodden  into %0ait :  or  else  it  is  because,  when  the  sweet  and  thin  Substance %0ais  drawn  out  of  it,  which  the  fiery  Power  of  the  Sun  very %0aeasily  draweth  up,  all  the  sharper  and  grosser  Parts  thereof %0a%0awhich  was  believed  to  be  the  cause  of  the  tides  requires  no  further  re- %0amark, than  that  the  cause  and  effect  are  acknowledged,  and  that  the  mode %0aof  influence  is  the  only  subject  of  error.  The  moon's  influence  in  causing %0ashell-fish  and  vegetables  to  increase  and  decrease,  was  believed  by  Aris- %0atotle, and  maintained  its  place  in  the  popular  opinion  until  a  late  date. %0aBut  in  tropical  countries  it  is  regarded  as  beyond  all  doubt,  that  the %0abright  shining  of  the  moon  has  a  deleterious  effect  on  all  bodies  exposed %0ato  it ;  and  the  fact  is  implicitly  credited  by  many  Europeans  who  have  in- %0aquired into  it.  Thus,  slaughtered  cattle  so  exposed,  are  believed  to  pass %0ainto  speedy  putrefaction ;  its  influence  on  eyes  when  asleep,  causes  blind- %0aness, and  on  the  head  a  tendency  to  delirium  or  death.  The  antiquity %0aand  extent  of  these  opinions  appear  from  Psalm  cxxi. ;  where  the  writer %0aexpresses  his  trust,  that  "  the  sun  shall  not  smite  thee  by  day,  nor  the %0amoon  by  night."  But  the  influence  is  not  always  hurtful :  at  least  on %0avegetation ;  for,  in  the  blessing  of  Moses  at  the  time  of  his  death,  on  the %0atribe  of  Joseph,  he  speaks  of"  the  precious  things  put  forth  by  the  moon" %0a(Deut.  xxxiii.  14).  Dr.Prichard  ("Egyptian  Mythology,"  p.  156)  says: %0a"  The  idea  that  the  moon  exerts  an  influence  favourable  to  propagation,  is %0aso  strange  and  absurd,  that  we  are  at  a  loss  to  imagine  how  it  can  have %0aarisen ;  and  it  is  truly  astonishing  to  find  that  similar  fictions  were  ex- %0atended through  a  great  part  of  the  Pagan  world.  Young  maids  among %0athe  Greenlanders  are  afraid  to  stare  long  at  the  moon,  imagining  that  they %0aincur  a  danger  of  becoming  pregnant."

And %0athis  is  a  truer  Reason  of  that  unpleasant  Taste  it  hath,  than %0athat  the  Sea  should  be  a  Sweat  issuing  out  of  the  Earth  con- %0atinually :  or,  because  overmuch  of  the  dry  Element  is  min- %0agled in  it  without  any  Vapour :  or  else  because  the  Nature %0aof  the  Earth  infecteth  the  Waters  with  some  strong  Medi- %0acine. We  find  among  Examples  that  there  happened  a  Pro- %0adigy to  Dionysius,  Tyrant  of  Sicily,  when  he  was  expelled %0afrom  his  Power,  which  was  :  that  the  Sea-water,  in  one  Day, %0ain  the  Harbour  became  fresh. %0a%0aCHAPTER  CI. %0aAlso,  of  the  Moons  Nature. %0a%0aON  the  contrary,  they  say  that  the  Moon  is  a  Planet %0afeminine,  tender  and  nightly;  that  it  dissolveth  Humours, %0adrawing  the  same,  but  carrying  them  not  away.  And  this %0aappeareth  evidently  because  that  the  Carcasses  of  wild  Beasts %0awhich  are  slain,  she  putrifieth  by  her  Influence,  if  she  shine %0aupon  them.  When  Men  also  are  found  asleep,  the  dull %0aNumbness  thereby  gathered  she  draweth  up  into  the  Head : %0ashe  thaweth  Ice,  and  with  a  moistening  Breath  relaxeth  all %0aThings.  Thus  you  see  how  Nature's  turn  is  served,  and  is %0aalways  sufficient ;  while  some  Stars  thicken  the  Elements, %0aand  others  again  resolve  the  same.  But  as  the  Sun  is  fed  by %0athe  salt  Seas,  so  the  Moon  is  nourished  by  the  fresh  Waters. %0a%0aCHAPTER  CII. %0aWhere  the  Sea  is  deepest. %0a%0aFABIANUS  saith,  that  the  Sea,  where  it  is  deepest,  ex- %0aceedeth  not  fifteen  Stadii.  Others  again  report,  that  in  Pon- %0atus  the  Sea  is  of  an  unmeasurable  Depth  over  against  the %0aNation  of  the  Coraxians,  at  the  Place  they  call  Bathea  Ponti, %0awhereof  the  Bottom  could  never  be  sounded  at  the  Distance %0aof  three  hundred  Stadii  from  the  Continent. %0a%0a%0a138  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%0aCHAPTER  CIII. %0aThe  Wonders  of  Waters^  Fountains,  and  Rivers. %0a%0aOF  all  Wonders  this  is  among  the  greatest,  that  some %0afresh  Waters  close  by  the  Sea  spring  forth  as  out  of  Pipes  : %0afor  the  Nature  of  the  Waters  also  ceaseth  not  from  mira- %0aculous Properties.  Fresh  Waters  are  borne  on  the  Sea,  as %0abeing,  no  doubt,  the  lighter :  and,  therefore,  the  Sea-water %0a(which  naturally  is  heavier)  beareth  up  whatsoever  is  brought %0ainto  it.  Also,  among  fresh  Waters,  some  there  be  that  float %0aover  others.  As  in  the  Lake  Fucinus,  the  River  that  runneth %0ainto  it ;  in  Larius,  Addua ;  in  Verbanus,  Ticinus ;  in  Benacus, %0aMincius;  in  Sevinus,  Ollius ;  in  Lemanus,  the  River  Rho- %0adanus.  As  for  this  River  beyond  the  Alps,  and  the  former  in %0aItaly,  for  many  a  Mile  as  they  pass  they  carry  forth  their  own %0aWaters  from  thence  as  Strangers,  and  none  other ;  and  the %0asame  no  larger  than  they  brought  in  with  them  This  is %0areported  likewise  of  Orontes,  a  River  in  Syria,  and  of  many %0aothers.  Some  Rivers  again  there  be,  which,  upon  an  Hatred %0ato  the  Sea,  run  under  the  Bottom  thereof;  as  Arethusa,  a %0aFountain  in  Syracuse  :  wherein  this  is  observed,  that  what- %0asoever is  cast  into  it  cometh  up  again  at  the  River  Alpheus, %0awhich,  running  through  Olympia,  falleth  into  the  Sea-shore %0aof  Peloponnesus.  There  go  under  the  Ground,  and  appear %0aabove  the  Ground  again,  Lycus  in  Asia,  Erasinus  in  Argolica, %0aTigris  in  Mesopotamia.  And  at  Athens,  the  Things  that  are %0aimmersed  in  the  Fountain  of  ^Esculapius  are  cast  up  again %0ain  Phalericus.  Also  in  the  Atinate  Plains,  the  River  that %0abecomes  buried  under  the  Earth  20,000  Paces  off,  appeareth %0aagain;  as  doth  Tirnavus  in  the  Territory  of  Aquileia.  In %0aAsphaltites  (a  Lake  in  Judea  which  produceth  Bitumen)  no- %0athing will  sink  ;  nor  will  it  in  Arethusa,  in  the  greater  Ar- %0amenia :  and  the  same,  though  it  be  full  of  Nitre,  produceth %0aFish.  In  the  Salentines'  Country  near  the  Town  Manduria %0athere  is  a  Lake  full  to  the  Bank,  out  of  which,  if  there  be %0aladen  as  much  Water  as  you  will,  it  decreaseth  not ;  nor  is  it %0aaugmented,  though  any  Quantity  be  poured  in.  In  a  River %0a%0a%0aBOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  139 %0a%0aof  the  Cicones,  and  in  the  Lake  Velinus  in  the  Picene  Terri- %0atory, if  Wood  be  thrown  in  it  becomes  covered  over  with  a %0astony  Bark.  Also  in  Surius,  a  River  of  Colchis,  the  like  is %0ato  be  seen  :  insomuch  that  the  Bark  which  overgroweth  it  is %0aas  hard  as  a  Stone.  Likewise  in  the  River  Silarus  beyond %0aSurrentum,  not  Twigs  only  that  are  dipped  therein,  but %0aLeaves  also,  grow  to  be  Stones ;  and  yet  the  Water  thereof %0aotherwise  is  wholesome  to  be  drunk.  In  the  Outlet  of  the %0aReatin  Marsh,  a  Rock  groweth  bigger;  and  in  the  Red  Sea %0athere  be  Olive-trees  and  other  Shrubs,  that  grow  up  green. %0aThere  be  also  very  many  Springs  which  have  a  wonderful %0aNature  for  their  boiling  Heat :  and  that  also  upon  the  very %0aMountains  of  the  Alps ;  and  in  the  Sea  between  Italy  and %0auEnaria :  as  in  the  Bay  Baianus,  and  the  River  Liris,  and %0amany  others.  For  in  very  many  Places  you  may  draw  fresh %0aWater  out  of  the  Sea ;  as  about  the  Islands  ChelidonisB  and %0aAradus  :  and  in  the  Ocean  about  Gades.  In  the  hot  Waters %0aof  the  Patovans  there  grow  green  Herbs :  in  those  of  the %0aPisanes  there  breed  Frogs :  and  at  Vetulonii  in  Etruria,  not %0afar  from  the  Sea,  Fishes  also  are  bred.  In  the  Territory %0aCasinas  there  is  a  River  called  Scatebra,  which  is  cold,  and %0ain  Summer  Time  more  abounding  in  Water  than  in  Winter  : %0ain  it,  as  also  in  Stymphalis  of  Arcadia,  there  are  brought %0aforth  River  Mussels.  In  Dodone,  the  Fountain  of  Jupiter %0abeing  exceedingly  chill,  quencheth  lighted  Torches  when %0adipped  therein  ;  but  if  you  hold  the  same  near  it  when  they %0anre  extinguished,  it  setteth  them  on  Fire  again.  The  same %0aSpring  at  Noontide  evermore  wanteth  Water,  for  which %0aCause  they  call  it  Anapavomenos :  by  and  by  it  beginneth  to %0arise  until  it  be  Midnight,  and  then  it  hath  great  Abundance : %0aand  from  that  Time  again  it  subsideth  by  little  and  little.  In %0aIllyricum  there  is  a  cold  Spring,  over  which,  if  there  be %0aspread  any  Clothes,  they  catch  Fire  and  burn.  The  Foun- %0atain of  Jupiter  Amman  in  the  Daytime  is  cold,  and  all  Night %0ait  is  boiling  hot.  In  the  Troglodytes  Country  there  is  a %0aFountain  of  the  Sun,  called  the  Sweet  Spring,  which  about %0aNoon  is  exceeding  cold ;  but  by  and  by  and  gradually  it %0a%0a%0a140  History  of  Nature.

The  Fountain  of  the  Po,  at  Noon  in  Summer, %0aintermitteth  to  boil,  and  is  then  ever  dry.  In  the  Island %0aTenedos  there  is  a  Spring,  which,  after  the  Summer  Solstice, %0aevermore  from  the  third  Hour  of  the  Night  to  the  sixth, %0adoth  overflow.  And  in  the  Island  of  Delos,  the  Fountain %0aInopus  falleth  and  riseth  after  the  same  Sort  as  the  Nile %0adoth,  and  together  with  it.  Over  against  the  River  Timavus %0athere  is  a  little  Island  in  the  Sea,  having  hot  Springs,  which %0aebb  and  flow  in  Time  and  Manner  as  the  Tide  of  the  Sea. %0aIn  the  Territory  of  the  Pitinates,  beyond  the  Apennines,  the %0aRiver  Novanus,  at  every  Midsummer  Time,  is  in  Flood  ;  but %0ain  Midwinter  is  dry.  In  the  Faliscan  Country  the  Water  of %0athe  River  Clitumnus  maketh  the  Cattle  white  that  drink  of %0ait.  And  in  Boeotia,  the  River  Melas  maketh  Sheep  black  : %0aCephyssus  running  out  of  the  same  Lake,  causeth  them  to  be %0awhite :  and  Penius,  again,  giveth  them  a  black  Colour : %0abut  Xanthus,  near  to  Ilium,  coloureth  them  reddish;  and %0ahereupon  the  River  took  that  Name.  In  the  Land  of  Pon- %0atus  there  is  a  River  that  watereth  the  Plains  of  Astace,  upon %0awhich,  those  Mares  that  feed  give  black  Milk  for  the  Food %0aof  that  Nation.  In  the  Reatin  Territory  there  is  a  Fountain %0acalled  Neminia,  which,  according  to  its  issuing  forth  out  of %0athis  or  that  Place,  signifieth  the  Change  in  the  Price  of  Vic- %0atuals. In  the  Haven  of  Brundusium  there  is  a  Well  that %0ayieldeth  to  Sailors  Water  which  will  never  corrupt.  The %0aWater  of  Lincestis,  called  Acidula  (or  Sour),  maketh  Men %0adrunken  no  less  than  Wine.  Also,  in  Paphlagonia,  and  in %0athe  Territory  of  Gales.  Also  in  the  Isle  of  Andros  there  is  a %0aFountain  in  the  Temple  of  Father  Bacchus,  which  upon  the %0aNones  of  January  always  runneth  with  Water  that  tasteth %0alike  Wine ;  as  Mulianus  verily  believeth  ;  who  was  a  Man %0athat  had  been  thrice  Consul :  the  Name  of  the  Spring  is %0aDios  Tecnosia.  Near  Nonacris,  in  Arcadia,  is  the  River %0aStyx  ;  differing  from  the  other  Styx  neither  in  Smell  nor %0aColour  :  drink  of  it  once,  and  it  is  present  Death.  Also,  in %0aBerosus  (an  Hill  of  the  Tauri),  there  be  three  Fountains,  the %0a%0a%0aBOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  \  4 1 %0a%0aWater  whereof  whosoever  drinketh  is  sure  to  die  of  it,  reme- %0adiless, and  yet  without  Pain.  In  a  Country  of  Spain,  called %0aCarrinensis,  two  Springs  run  near  together,  the  one  rejecting %0aand  the  other  swallowing  up  all  Things.  In  the  same  Coun- %0atry there  is  another  Water  which  sheweth  all  Fishes  within %0ait  of  a  golden  Colour;  but  if  they  be  taken  out  of  that  Water, %0athey  be  like  other  Fishes.  In  the  Cannensian  Territory, %0anear  the  Lake  Larius,  there  is  a  large  Fountain,  which  every %0aHour  continually  swelleth  and  falleth  down  again.  In  the %0aIsland  Sidonia,  before  Lesbos,  there  is  a  hot  Fountain  that %0arunneth  only  in  the  Spring.  The  Lake  Sinnaus,  in  Asia,  is %0ainfected  with  the  Wormwood  growing  about  it.  At  Colo- %0aphon, in  the  Cave  of  Apollo  Clarius,  there  is  a  Channel  with %0aWater:  they  that  drink  of  it  foretell  strange  Things  like %0aOracles  ;  but  they  live  the  shorter  Time  for  it.  Rivers  run- %0aning backward  even  our  Age  hath  seen  in  the  latter  Years  of %0athe  Prince  Nero,  as  we  have  related  in  the  Acts  of  his  Life. %0aNow,  that  all  Springs  are  colder  in  Summer  than  Winter, %0awho  knoweth  not?  as  also  these  wondrous  Works  of  Nature, %0athat  Brass  and  Lead  in  the  Lump  sink  down  in  Fluid,  but  if %0athey  be  spread  out  into  thin  Plates  they  float :  and  let  the %0aWeight  be  all  one,  yet  some  Things  settle  to  the  Bottom ;  and %0aothers,  again,  are  borne  above :  that  heavy  Burdens  be  re- %0amoved with  more  Ease  in  Water.  Likewise  that  the  Stone %0aThyrreus,  however  large,  doth  swim  when  entire:  but  broken %0ainto  Pieces,  it  sinketh.  Bodies  newly  dead  fall  to  the  Bottom %0aof  the  Water,  but  when  swollen  they  rise  again.  Empty  Ves- %0asels are  not  so  easily  drawn  out  of  the  Water  as  those  that  be %0afull :  Rain-water  for  Salt-pits  is  more  profitable  than  any %0aother  :  and  Salt  cannot  be  made  unless  fresh  Water  be  min- %0agled :  Sea-water  is  longer  before  it  freezes,  but  it  is  sooner %0amade  hot.  In  Winter  the  Sea  is  hotter,  and  in  Autumn %0asalter.

But  first,  out  of  Waters.  In %0aa  City  of  Comagene,  named  Samosatis,  there  is  a  Pond %0ayielding  forth  a  burning,  slimy  Mud  (called  Maltha2).  When %0ait  meeteth  with  any  Thing  sqlid  it  sticketh  to  it ;  and  if  it  be %0atouched  it  followeth  them  that  flee  from  it.  By  this  means %0athe  Townsmen  defended  their  Walls  when  Lucullus  assaulted %0ait ;  and  his  Soldiers  were  burned  in  their  own  Armour.  It %0aburns  even  in  Water.  Experience  hath  taught,  that  Earth %0aonly  will  quench  it %0a%0aCHAPTER  CV. %0aOf  Naphtha. %0a%0aOF  the  like  Nature  is  Naphtha  :  for  so  is  it  called  about %0aBabylonia,  and  in  the  Austacenes'  Country  in  Parthia ;  and %0ait  runneth  in  the  Manner  of  liquid  Bitumen.  There  is  great %0aAffinity  between  Fire  and  it ;  for  Fire  is  ready  to  leap  unto %0ait  immediately,  if  it  be  near  it.  Thus  (they  say)  Medea %0aburnt  her  Husband's  Concubine,  by  Reason  that  her  Crown %0aanointed  therewith  was  caught  by  the  Fire  after  she  had %0aapproached  to  the  Altars  with  the  Intention  to  sacrifice3. %0a%0a1  Many  of  the  phenomena  here  related  are  merely  exaggerations  of %0athe  truth ;  and  many,  however  strange,  are  easily  explained :  as  the  inter- %0amitting springs,  and  those  which  kindle  into  fire :  the  latter  owing  this  pro- %0aperty either  to  the  extrication  of  hydrogen  gas  or  naphtha. — Wcrn.

For  in  Phaselis  the %0aMountain  Chimaera  likewise  burneth,  and  that  with  a  con- %0atinual Fire  both  Night  and  Day  :  Ctesias  of  Gnidos  writeth, %0athat  the  Fire  thereof  is  inflamed  with  Water,  but  quenched %0awith  Earth.  In  the  same  Lycia  the  Mountains  Hephaestii %0abeing  touched  with  a  flaming  Torch,  do  so  burn  that  the %0avery  Stones  of  the  Rivers  and  the  Sand  in  the  Waters  are %0aset  on  Fire ;  and  the  same  Fire  is  maintained  with  Rain. %0aThey  report  that  if  a  Man  make  a  Furrow  with  a  Staff  that %0ais  set  on  Fire  by  them,  there  follow  Gutters  of  Fire.  In %0athe  Bactrians'  Country,  the  Top  of  the  Cophantus  burneth %0aby  Night.  Amongst  the  Medians,  also,  and  the  Caestian %0aNation,  the  same  Mountain  burneth  :  but  principally  in  the %0aConfines  of  Persis.  At  Susis,  indeed,  in  a  Place  called  the %0aWhite  Tower,  the  Fire  proceeds  out  of  fifteen  Chimneys,  and %0athe  greatest  of  them,  even  in  the  Daytime,  carrieth  Fire. %0aThere  is  a  Plain  about  Babylonia1,  in  Manner  of  a  Fish-pond, %0awhich,  for  the  Quantity  of  an  Acre,  burneth  likewise.  Also, %0anear  the  Mountain  Hesperius  in  Ethiopia,  the  Fields  in  the %0aNight-time  shine  like  Stars.  The  like  is  to  be  seen  in  the %0aTerritory  of  the  Megapolitans,  although  the  Field  there %0abe  pleasant  within,  and  not  burning  the  Boughs  of  the  thick %0aGrove  above  it.  And  near  a  warm  Spring  the  hollow, %0a%0a1  These  natural  fires  were  objects  of  idolatrous  veneration  by  the  in- %0ahabitants of  this  country,  from  a  very  early  period :  and  opinions  of  a %0asimilar  nature  have  continued  in  the  East  to  the  present  day.  Zoroaster, %0aif  not  the  author,  is  believed  to  have  been  the  great  reformer  of  this  doc- %0atrine ;  which  by  some  is  supposed  to  have  had  its  origin  in  times  before %0athe  Flood.—  Wern.

But %0awho  would  wonder  at  these  Things  ?  In  the  Midst  of  the %0aSea,  Hiera,  one  of  the  ^Etolian  Islands  near  to  Italy,  burned %0atogether  with  the  Sea  for  certain  Days  together,  during %0athe  Time  of  the  social  War,  until  a  Legation  of  the  Senate %0amade  Expiation.  But  that  which  burneth  with  the  greatest %0aFire  is  a  Hill  of  the  Ethiopians  called  Theonochema ; %0awhich  sendeth  out  the  fiercest  Flames  in  the  hottest  Sun- %0ashine.

What  a  Nature %0ais  that  which  feedeth  the  most  greedy  Voracity  in  the  whole %0aWorld  without  Loss  of  itself?  Add  thereto  the  infinite  Num- %0aber of  Stars,  the  immense  Sun  ;  moreover,  the  Fires  in  Men's %0aBodies,  and  those  that  are  inbred  in  Stones ;  the  Attrition, %0aalso,  of  certain  Woods  one  against  another ;  yea,  and  those %0awithin  Clouds,  the  Original  of  Lightnings.

In  Nymphaeum  there  cometh  a  Flame  out  of %0aa  Rock,  which  is  set  a-burning  with  Rain.  There  is  the %0alike  at  the  Waters  called  Scantiae.  But  this  is  but  feeble %0awhen  it  passeth,  neither  endureth  it  long  in  any  other  Mat- %0ater. There  is  an  Ash-tree  covering  this  fiery  Fountain,  which, %0anotwithstanding,  is  always  green.  In  the  Territory  of  Mu- %0atina,  there  riseth  up  Fire  also,  upon  Days  devoted  to  Vulcan. %0aIt  is  found  written,  that  if  a  Coal  of  Fire  fall  upon  the  arable %0aFields  under  Aricia,  the  Soil  presently  is  on  Fire.  In  the %0aSabines  Territory,  as  also  in  that  of  the  Sidicines,  Stones %0aanointed  will  be  set  on  Fire.  In  aTown  of  the  Salentines,  called %0aEgnatia,  if  Wood  be  laid  upon  a  certain  hallowed  Stone  there, %0ait  will  immediately  flame  out.  Upon  the  Altar  of  Juno %0aLacinia,  standing  in  the  open  Air,  the  Ashes  lie  immovable, %0ablow  what  stormy  Winds  that  will  on  every  Side.  Besides, %0athere  be  Fires  that  suddenly  arise,  both  in  Waters  and  even %0aabout  the  Bodies  of  Men.  Valerius  Antias  reporteth,  that %0athe  Lake  Thrasymenus  once  burned  all  over  :  also,  that  when %0aServius  Tullius,  in  his  childhood,  lay  asleep,  a  Flame  shone %0aout  of  his  Head  l :  likewise,  as  L.  Martins  made  an  Oration %0ato  the  Army  after  the  two  Scipios  were  slain  in  Spain,  and %0aexhorted  his  Soldiers  to  revenge  their  Death,  his  Head  was, %0ain  like  Manner,  in  a  Flame.  More  of  this,  and  more  dis- %0atinctly, will  we  write  by-and-by.  For  now  we  exhibit  the %0aWonders  of  all  Things  intermingled  together.  But  my  Mind %0abeing  passed  beyond  the  Interpretation  of  Nature,  hasteneth %0ato  lead,  as  it  were,  by  the  Hand,  the  Minds  of  the  Readers %0athroughout  the  whole  World. %0a%0a%0a1  There  are  instances  in  modern,  as  well  as  in  ancient  times,  of  such %0aluminous  appearances  proceeding  from  the  human  body :  most  commonly %0awhen  it  is  in  a  state  of  emaciation  or  chronic  disease.  Its  cause  is,  the %0aexcretion  of  phosphoric  vapour  mixed  with  the  perspiration.

But,  ac- %0acording to  Isidorus,  9818.  Artemidorus  addeth,  more- %0aover, from  Gades  within  the  Circuit  of  the  sacred  Promon- %0atory to  the  Cape  Artabrum,  where  the  Front  of  Spain  beareth %0aout  furthest,  in  Length  891  Miles.  This  Measure  runneth %0atwo  Ways.  From  the  River  Ganges  and  the  Mouth  thereof, %0awhere  it  dischargeth  itself  into  the  East  Ocean,  through %0aIndia  and  Parthyene  to  Myriandrum,  a  City  of  Syria,  situ- %0aated upon  the  Gulf  of  Isa,  5215  Miles.  From  thence  by  the %0anearest  Voyage,  to  the  Island  Cyprus,  to  Patara  in  Lycia, %0aRhodes,  and  Astypatsea  (Islands  lying  in  the  Carpathian  Sea), %0ato  Taenarus  in  Laconia,  Lilybseum  in  Sicily,  Calaris  in  Sar- %0adinia, 3450  Miles.  Then  to  Gades  1450  Miles.  Which %0aMeasures  being  put  together,  make,  from  the  said  Sea,  8578 %0aMiles.  The  other  Way,  which  is  more  certain,  lieth  most %0aopen  by  Land,  from  Ganges  to  the  River  Euphrates,  5021 %0aMiles.  From  thence  to  Mazaca,  in  Cappadocia,  244  Miles ; %0aand  thence  through  Phrygia  and  Caria  to  Ephesus,  498  Miles. %0aFrom  Ephesus,  through  the  ^Egean  Sea,  to  Delos,  200  Miles. %0aThen  to  Isthmus,  212  Miles.  From  thence  by  Land,  arid  by %0athe  Laconian  Sea  and  the  Gulf  of  Corinth,  to  PatraB  in %0aPeloponnesus,  202J  Miles :  to  Leucas,  86J  Miles,  and  as %0amuch  to  Corcyra.  Then  to  Acroceraunia,  132£  Miles  :  to %0aBrundusium,  86£  Miles :  so  to  Rome,  360  Miles.  Then  to %0athe  Alps,  as  far  as  the  Village  of  Cincomagus,  518  Miles. %0aThrough  Gaul  to  the  Pyrenean  Mountains,  unto  Illiberis, %0a556  Miles ;  to  the  Ocean  and  Sea-coast  of  Spain,  332  Miles. %0aThen  the  Passage  over  to  Gades,  1\  Miles.  Which  Measure, %0aby  Artemidorus9  Estimation,  maketh  in  all  8685  Miles.

Whereby  it  appeareth  plainly,  how  much  of %0athe  one  Side  the  Heat  of  Fire,  and  on  the  other  Side  frozen %0aWater  hath  stolen  away.  For  I  am  not  of  opinion  that  the %0aEarth  goeth  no  further  than  this ;  for  then  it  would  not  have %0athe  Form  of  a  Globe  ;  but  that  the  Places  on  either  Side  be %0auninhabitable,  and  therefore  not  discovered.  This  Measure %0arunneth  from  the  Shore  of  the  Ethiopian  Ocean,  where  now %0ait  is  inhabited,  to  Meroe,  550  Miles.  From  thence  to %0aAlexandria,  1240  Miles;  to  Rhodes,  583  Miles;  to  Gnidus, %0a84J  Miles;  to  Cos,  25  Miles;  to  Samus,  100  Miles;  to %0aChius,  84  Miles ;  to  Mitylen£,  65  Miles  ;  to  Tenedos,  28 %0aMiles  ;  to  the  Promontory  Sigaeum,  12J  Miles  ;  to  the  Mouth %0aof  Pontus,  312J  Miles;  to  Carambis,  the  Promontory,  350 %0aMiles;  to  the  Mouth  of  Maeotis,  312J  Miles;  to  the  Haven %0aof  Tanais,  265  Miles :  which  Voyage  may  be  made  shorter %0a(with  the  Vantage  of  sailing  directly)  by  89  Miles.  From %0athe  Haven  of  Tanais,  the  most  diligent  Authors  have  set %0adown  no  Measure.  Artemidorus  was  of  opinion,  that  all  be- %0ayond was  not  discovered,  allowing  that  about  Tanais  the %0aSarmatian  Nations  inhabit ;  who  lie  to  the  North.  Isidorus %0ahath  added  hereto  1200  Miles,  as  far  as  to  Thule  :  which  is %0agrounded  upon  bare  Conjecture.  I  understand  that  the  Bor- %0aders of  the  Sarmatians  are  known  to  have  no  less  an  Extent %0athan  this  last-mentioned  cometh  to.  And  otherwise,  how %0amuch  must  it  be  that  would  contain  such  innumerable  Na- %0ations, shifting  their  Seats  every  now  and  then.  Whereby  I %0ajudge  that  the  Over-measure  of  the  Clime  inhabitable  is %0amuch  greater.  For  I  know  certainly,  that  from  Germany %0avery  great  Islands  have  been  discovered  not  long  since.  And %0athus  much  of  the  Length  and  Breadth  of  the  Earth,  which %0aI  thought  worth  the  writing.

This  Man  was  a  Melian,  famous  for  his  Skill  in %0aGeometry :  he  died  very  aged  in  his  own  Country :  his  near %0aKinswomen,  who  were  his  Heirs,  solemnised  his  Funerals. %0aThese  Women,  as  they  came  some  few  Days  after  to  perform %0athe  Obsequies  thereto  belonging,  are  said  to  have  found  in %0ahis  Monument  an  Epistle  of  this  Dionysodorus,  written  in  his %0aown  Name,  To  them  above ;  to  this  Effect :  that  he  had  gone %0afrom  his  Sepulchre  to  the  Bottom  of  the  Earth,  and  that  it %0awas  thither  42,000  Stadia.  Neither  wanted  there  Geome- %0atricians who  made  this  Interpretation,  that  this  Epistle  was %0asent  from  the  Centre  of  the  Earth ;  to  which  Place  down- %0award from  the  uppermost,  the  Way  was  longest;  and  the %0asame  was  just  half  the  Diameter  of  the  Ball :  whereupon %0afollowed  this  Computation,  that  they  pronounced  the  Circuit %0ato  be  255,000  Stadia.  The  harmonical  Proportion  which %0aforceth  this  Nature  of  Things  to  agree  unto  itself,  addeth %0aunto  this  Measure  7000  Stadia,  and  maketh  the  Earth  to  be %0athe  96,000th  Part  of  the  whole  World. %0a%0a%0aIN  THE  THIRD   BOOK %0a%0aARE    COMPREHENDED    THE %0a%0aREGIONS,  NATIONS,  SEAS,  TOWNS,  PORTS,  MOUNTAINS,  RIVERS, %0a%0aWITH  THEIR  MEASURES,  AND  PEOPLE,   EITHER  AT  THIS %0a%0aDAY  KNOWN,  OR  IN  TIMES  PAST  ; %0a%0aAS  FOLLOWETH  : %0a%0a%0aCHAP. %0a%0a1.

What  is  beyond  the  Compass %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Author  manifests  a  philosophic,  as  well  as  pious  spirit,  in  begin- %0a%3c ning his  work  with  a  reference  to  Divine  power ;  but  in  giving  this  idea %0a%3c of  the  nature  of  the  world,  and  representing  it  as  a  separate  and  inde- %0a%3c pendent divinity,  he  adopts  an  ancient  speculative  opinion  derived  from  the %0a%3c Oriental  philosophy,  in  preference  to  the  popular  opinion  of  his  country, %0a%3c which  is  selected  by  Ovid  in  his  Introduction  to  the  "  Metamorphoses;"  and %0a%3c which  ascribed  the  creation  of  the  world  to  an  already  existing  or  eternal %0a%3c God  —  "  whichever  God  he  was :"  though  not  to  the  highest  in  rank  of  the %0a%3c Heathen  Mythology ;  for  the  latter  is  represented  as  descended  from  pre- %0a%3c viously existing,  or  humanly  deified,  parents,  and  consequently  was  of  a %0a%3c subsequent  age.

Sacred  it  is,  everlasting,  infi- %0a%3c nite, all  in  all,  or  rather  itself  all  and  absolute  :  limited,  yet %0a%3c seeming  infinite  :  in  all  Motions,  certain ;  though  in  Appear- %0a%3c ance uncertain  :  comprehending  in  itself  all  both  without %0a%3c and  within  :  Nature's  Work,  and  yet  very  Nature  itself.  It %0a%3c is  Madness  that  some  have  thought  in  their  Mind  to  mea- %0a%3c sure it ;  yea,  and  durst  in  Writing  set  down  the  Dimensions %0a%3c thereof:  that  others  again,  by  Occasion  hereupon  taken, %0a%3c or  on  this  founded,  have  taught,  That  there  are  Worlds  in- %0a%3c to slip  from  the  minds  of  learned  Heathens,  through  their  speculations %0a%3c into  occult  causes,  and  the  wrapping  up  of  religion  from  the  inquiries  of %0a%3c the  vulgar,  as  being  too  high  for  their  comprehension,  they  were  led  to %0a%3c the  conception  of  what,  in  fact,  was  no  more  than  a  mere  abstraction,  and %0a%3c destitute  of  all  proper  personality :  a  simple,  unconscious  fatality,  with %0a%3c little  volition :  and,  in  truth,  no  better  than  a  diffusive  aether,  or,  as  it %0a%3c would  now  be  denominated,  galvanic  influence.  The  philosophy  of %0a%3c Pythagoras  was  derived  from  the  East;  "But  it  was  this,"  says  Lord %0a%3c Bacon  ("  Natural  History,"  10th  century),  "  which  did  first  plant  a  mon- %0a%3c strous imagination,  which  afterwards  was,  by  the  school  of  Plato  and %0a%3c others,  watered  and  nourished.  It  was,  that  the  world  was  one,  entire, %0a%3c perfect,  living  creature  ;  insomuch  as  Apollonius  of  Tyana,  a  Pythagorean %0a%3c prophet,  affirmed  that  the  ebbing  and  flowing  of  the  sea  was  the  respira- %0a%3c tion of  the  world,  drawing  in  water  as  breath,  and  putting  it  forth  again. %0a%3c They  went  on,  and  inferred,  that  if  the  world  were  a  living  creature,  it %0a%3c had  a  soul  and  spirit ;  which  also  they  held,  calling  it '  spiritus  mundij  the %0a%3c spirit  or  soul  of  the  world.  By  which  they  did  not  intend  God  (for  they %0a%3c did  admit  of  a  deity  besides),  but  only  the  soul,  or  essential  form,  of  the %0a%3c universe.  This  foundation  being  laid,  they  might  build  upon  it  what %0a%3c they  would;  for  in  a  living  creature,  though  never  so  great  (as,  for %0a%3c example,  in  a  great  whale),  the  sense  and  the  effects  of  any  one  part  of %0a%3c the  body  instantly  make  a  transcursion  throughout  the  whole  body.  So %0a%3c that  by  this  they  did  insinuate,  that  no  distance  of  place,  nor  want  nor %0a%3c indisposition  of  matter,  could  hinder  magical  operations ;  but  that,  for %0a%3c example,  we  mought  here  in  Europe  have  sense  and  feeling  of  that  which %0a%3c was  done  in  China ;  and  likewise  we  mought  work  any  effect  without  and %0a%3c against  matter;  and  this  not  holden  by  the  co-operation  of  angels  or %0a%3c spirits,  but  only  by  the  unity  and  harmony  of  nature."  This  was  the %0a%3c occult  cause,  to  which  all  the  otherwise  unaccountable  operations  of %0a%3c nature  might  easily  be  referred.  We  have  a  curious  instance  of  such  a %0a%3c method  of  explanation  at  the  end  of  the  ninety-third  chapter  of  this  book. %0a%3c —  Wern.Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  3 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c numerable :  as  if  we  are  to  believe  so  many  Natures  as  there %0a%3c are  Heavens :  or  if  all  were  reduced  to  one,  yet  there  should %0a%3c be  so  many  Suns  and  Moons,  with  the  Rest  also  of  those %0a%3c immeasurable  and  innumerable  Stars  in  that  one :  as  though %0a%3c in  this  plurality  of  Worlds  we  should  not  always  meet  with %0a%3c the  same  Question  still  at  every  Turn  of  our  Thought,  for %0a%3c Want  of  some  End  to  rest  upon  :  or,  if  this  infiniteness  could %0a%3c possibly  be  assigned  to  Nature,  the  Work-mistress  of  all ; %0a%3c the  same  might  not  be  understood  more  easily  in  that  one %0a%3c Heaven  which  we  see  ;  so  great  a  Work  as  it  is.  Now  surely %0a%3c it  is  more  than  Madness  to  quit  this,  and  to  keep  seeking %0a%3c without,  as  if  all  Things  within  were  well  and  clearly  known %0a%3c already :  as  if  any  Man  could  take  the  Measure  of  another %0a%3c Thing,  who  knoweth  not  his  own :  or  the  Mind  of  Man %0a%3c might  see  those  Things  which  the  World  itself  may  not %0a%3c receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  II. %0a%3c Of  the  Figure  of  the  World. %0a%3c %0a%3c THAT  the  Form  of  the  World  is  round1,  in  the  Figure  of %0a%3c a  perfect  Globe,  its  Name  in  the  first  Place,  and  the  Consent %0a%3c of  all  Men  agreeing  to  call  it  in  Latin  Orbis  (a  Globe),  as %0a%3c also  many  natural  Reasons,  evidently  shew.  For  not  only %0a%3c because  such  a  Figure  every  Way  falleth  and  bendeth  upon %0a%3c itself,  is  able  to  uphold  itself,  includeth  and  containeth  itself, %0a%3c having  need  of  no  joints  for  this  purpose,  as  finding  in  any %0a%3c Part  thereof  no  End  or  Beginning :  or  because  this  Form %0a%3c agreeth  best  to  that  Motion,  whereby  continually  it  must %0a%3c turn  about  (as  hereafter  will  appear) :  but  also  because  the %0a%3c Eyesight  doth  approve  the  same ;  because,  look  which  Way %0a%3c soever  you  will,  it  appeareth  convex,  and  even  on  all  sides; %0a%3c a  Thing  not  incident  to  any  other  Figure. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  it  was  an  oblate  spheroid,  flattened  at  the  poles,  was  little %0a%3c likely  to  be  known  by  observers,  however  acute,  whose  opinion  of  the %0a%3c uninhabitable  nature  of  the  frigid  and  torrid  zones  would  lead  them  to %0a%3c limit  their  practical  inquiries  to  the  temperate.  The  good  sense  of  Pliny %0a%3c induced  him  to  prefer  the  opinion  of  the  rotundity  of  the  globe,  to  that  of %0a%3c Epicurus,  that  it  was  an  extended  plane. —  Wern.

Whether  it  being  in %0a%3c Height  exceedingly  great,  and  therefore  the  Sound  of  so %0a%3c huge  a  Frame,  whilst  it  is  whirled  about  unceasingly,  cannot %0a%3c be  heard  with  our  Ears,  I  cannot  easily  imagine  :  no  more, %0a%3c by  Hercules !  than  1  may  vouch  the  Ringing  of  the  Stars  that %0a%3c are  driven  round  therewith,  and  roll  their  own  Spheres :  or %0a%3c determine,  that  as  the  Heaven  movetb,  it  represents  a  plea- %0a%3c sant and  incredibly  sweet  Harmony  :  although  to  us  within, %0a%3c by  Day  and  Night,  it  seemeth  to  roll  on  in  Silence.  That %0a%3c there  is  imprinted  on  it  the  Figures  of  living  Creatures,  and %0a%3c of  all  Kinds  of  Things  besides  without  Number,  as  also  that %0a%3c the  Body  thereof  is  not  all  over  smooth  and  slippery  (as  we %0a%3c see  in  Birds'  Eggs),  which  excellent  Authors  have  termed %0a%3c Tenerum,  is  shewn  by  Arguments ;  for  by  the  Fall  of  natural %0a%3c Seeds  of  all  Things  from  thence,  and  those  for  the  most  Part %0a%3c mixed  one  with  another,  there  are  produced  in  the  World, %0a%3c and  in  the  Sea  especially,  an  immense  Number  of  monstrous %0a%3c Shapes.  Besides  this,  our  Sight  testifieth  the  same  ;  for  in %0a%3c one  Place  there  appeareth  the  Resemblance  of  a  Chariot,  in %0a%3c another  of  a  Bear,  or  a  Bull,  and  of  a  Letter  (A),  and  prin- %0a%3c cipally the  middle  Circle  over  our  Head,  where  it  is  more %0a%3c white  than  the  Rest. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IV. %0a%3c Why  the  World  is  called  Mundus. %0a%3c %0a%3c FOR  my  own  Part,  I  arn  ruled  by  the  general  Consent  of %0a%3c all  Nations.

Arid  the  Order  of %0a%3c Things  therein  contributes  to  this,  and  especially  the  defined %0a%3c Circle  called  Signifer,  or  the  Zodiac,  divided  by  the  Forms %0a%3c of  Twelve  living  Creatures,  through  which  is  the  Sun's  Track  ; %0a%3c preserving  the  same  Course  for  so  many  Ages. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  V. %0a%3c Of  the  four  Elements l. %0a%3c %0a%3c I  SEE  no  doubt  regarding  the  Number  of  the  Elements, %0a%3c that  they  are  four.  The  highest,  Fire  :  from  whence  are %0a%3c those  bright  Eyes  of  so  many  shining  Stars.  The  next, %0a%3c Spirit,  which  the  Greeks  and  our  Countrymen  by  one  Name %0a%3c called  Air :  this  Element  is  vital,  and  it  soon  passeth  through %0a%3c all,  and  is  intrinsically  mixed  in  the  Whole :  by  the  Power %0a%3c whereof,  the  Earth  hangeth  suspended  in  the  midst,  together %0a%3c with  the  fourth  Element,  of  Water.  Thus,  by  a  mutual  em- %0a%3c bracing of  each  other,  divers  Natures  are  linked  together : %0a%3c and  so  the  light  Elements  are  restrained  by  the  heavier,  that %0a%3c they  do  not  fly  off:  and,  on  the  contrary,  the  massier  are %0a%3c held  up,  that  they  fall  not  down,  by  means  of  the  lighter, %0a%3c which  seek  to  mount  aloft.  So,  through  an  equal  Endeavour %0a%3c to  the  Contrary,  each  of  them  holds  its  own,  bound  as  it %0a%3c were  by  the  restless  Circuit  of  the  World  itself:  which,  run- %0a%3c ning evermore  upon  itself,  the  Earth  falleth  to  be  lowest, %0a%3c and  in  the  Middle  of  the  Whole :  and  the  same  hanging %0a%3c steadily  by  the  Pole  of  the  Universe,  poiseth  those  Ele- %0a%3c ments by  which  it  hangeth.  Thus  it  alone  resteth  un- %0a%3c movable,  whilst  the  whole  Frame  of  the  World  turneth %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  idea  here  conveyed  of  the  existence  of  four  elements,  which %0a%3c enclose  each  other,  each  heavier  one  in  succession  subsiding  below  the %0a%3c other,  is  more  fully  expressed  by  Ovid,  in  his  account  of  the  creation %0a%3c of  the  world  at  the  beginning  of  the  first  book  of  his  "  Metamorphoses." %0a%3c The  opinion  was  generally  entertained,  of  these  elements  being  the  con- %0a%3c stituents of  all  things,  until  modern  chemical  analysis  demonstrated  that %0a%3c themselves  are  compounded  of  other  and  more  simple  elements.  Yet %0a%3c the  language  of  the  ancient  opinion  has  not  altogether  ceased  from  use, %0a%3c even  at  the  present  time. —  Wern.

In  the  midst  of  them  the  Sun  taketh  his %0a%3c Course,  as  being  the  greatest  and  most  powerful  of  all :  the %0a%3c very  Ruler,  not  of  Times  and  Seasons  only,  and  of  the  Earth, %0a%3c but  also  of  the  Stars  and  Sky  itself.  We  ought  to  believe %0a%3c this  Sun1  to  be  the  very  Life  and  (to  speak  more  plainly)  the %0a%3c Soul  of  the  whole  World,  and  the  principal  Governance  of %0a%3c Nature;  and,  considering  his  Operations,  nothing  less  than  a %0a%3c divine  Power.  He  it  is  that  giveth  Light  to  all  Things,  and %0a%3c scatters  their  Darkness  :  he  hideth  the  other  Stars  ;  he  or- %0a%3c dereth  the  Seasons  in  their  alternative  Course  ;  he  tempereth %0a%3c the  Year,  which  ariseth  ever  fresh  again  for  the  Good  of  the %0a%3c World.  He  disperseth  the  Sadness  of  the  Sky,  and  cleareth %0a%3c the  Cloudiness  of  the  Mind  of  Man  ;  to  other  Stars,  likewise, %0a%3c he  lendeth  his  own  Light.  Most  excellent  and  glorious  he %0a%3c is,  as  seeing  all,  and  hearing  all ;  as,  I  see,  is  the  Opinion  of %0a%3c Homer*  (the  Prince  of  Learning)  regarding  him  alone. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  We  find  the  ascription  of  Divinity  to  be  the  last  resource  in  ex- %0a%3c plaining the  operation  of  a  hidden  cause  in  nature.  A  false  divinity  was, %0a%3c therefore,  the  foundation  of  errors  in  philosophy ;  and  the  latter  again %0a%3c reacted  on  the  former. — Wern.

For  God,  whosoever  he  be  (if  haply  there  be  any  other, %0a%3c but  the  World  itself),  and  in  what  Part  soever  resident,  all %0a%3c Sense  He  is,  all  Sight,  all  Hearing  :  He  is  the  whole  of  the  Life %0a%3c and  of  the  Soul,  all  of  Himself.  And  to  believe  that  there  be %0a%3c Gods  innumerable,  and  those  according  to  Men's  Virtues  and %0a%3c Vices,  as  Chastity,  Concord,  Understanding,  Hope,  Honour, %0a%3c Clemency,  Faith  ;  or  (as  Democritus  was  of  Opinion)  that %0a%3c there  are  two  Gods  only,  that  is,  Punishment  and  Benefit : %0a%3c these  Conceits  render  Men's  idle  Negligence  the  greater.  But %0a%3c frail  and  wearisome  mortal  Men,  remembering  their  own %0a%3c Infirmity,  have  digested  these  Things  apart,  to  the  End  that %0a%3c each  one  might  from  thence  choose  to  worship  that  whereof %0a%3c he  stood  most  in  need.  And  hence  it  is,  that  in  different %0a%3c Nations  we  find  the  Gods  named  diversely  :  and  in  the  same %0a%3c Region  there  are  innumerable  Gods.  The  infernal  Powers, %0a%3c likewise,  and  Diseases,  yea,  and  many  Plagues,  have  been %0a%3c ranged  in  Divisions,  and  reckoned  for  Gods ;  which,  with %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  this  chapter  the  author  openly  asserts  his  disbelief  of  the  truth  of %0a%3c the  established  system  of  religion  of  his  country ;  and  his  manner  of  doing %0a%3c this  sufficiently  shews  the  confidence  he  felt,  of  finding  sympathy  in  his %0a%3c scepticism  among  the  learned  and  refined  classes  of  society.  This  system %0a%3c was,  indeed,  singularly  destitute  of  evidence ;  and  the  reasons  he  gives %0a%3c for  his  disbelief  shew  it  to  have  been  as  absurd  to  the  eye  of  examination %0a%3c as  it  was  unsupported  by  argument.  That  the  chief  deities  of  the  Hea- %0a%3c then were  no  more  than  deceased  men  who  had  benefited  the  world  in %0a%3c their  lives,  or  at  least  acquired  human  respect,  is  asserted  by  many  other %0a%3c ancient  authors ;  but  it  is  to  be  regretted  that  the  author  should  so  far %0a%3c join  in  the  error  as  from  it  to  find  occasion  for  thereby  mixing  up  with %0a%3c it  the  flattery  of  a  court.  The  treatise  of  Cicero,  "  On  the  Nature  of  the %0a%3c Gods,"  and  the  remarks  of  Pliny,  are  proofs  that  the  ancient  Heathens %0a%3c were  not  slow  to  discern  the  errors  of  the  popular  system  of  religion, %0a%3c though  they  were  incapable  of  discovering  or  appreciating  the  true. — %0a%3c Wern.

By  this  it  may  be %0a%3c conceived  that  there  are  a  greater  Number  of  Gods  in  Hea- %0a%3c ven than  of  Men  upon  Earth,  since  every  one  makes  as  many %0a%3c Gods  as  he  pleases,  fitting  himself  with  Junoes  and  Genii  for %0a%3c his  Patrons.

But,  surely,  to  believe %0a%3c that  Gods  have  contracted  Marriage,  and  that  in  so  long  a %0a%3c Time  no  Children  should  be  born  to  them  :  also  that  some %0a%3c are  aged,  and  ever  grey-headed :  others,  again,  young  and %0a%3c always  Children  :  that  they  be  black  of  Complexion,  winged, %0a%3c lame,  hatched  of  Eggs,  living  and  dying  on  each  alternate %0a%3c Day ;  are  mere  childish  Fooleries.  But  it  exceedeth  all  Im- %0a%3c pudency  to  imagine  Adulteries  among  them :  and  presently, %0a%3c also,  scolding,  and  Malice ;  and  more  than  that,  how  there %0a%3c be  Gods  that  are  Patrons  of  Theft  and  Wickedness.  He  is %0a%3c a  God  to  a  Man  that  helpeth  Him :  and  this  is  the  true  Way %0a%3c to  everlasting  Glory.  In  this  Way  went  the  Romans  in  old %0a%3c Time  :  and  in  this  Track,  at  this  Day,  goeth,  with  heavenly %0a%3c Pace,  Vespasian  Augustus,  with  his  Children ;  the  most %0a%3c mighty  Ruler  of  the  whole  World  :  relieving  the  afflicted %0a%3c State  of  the  Empire.  And  this  is  the  most  ancient  Manner %0a%3c of  Requital  to  such  Benefactors,  that  they  should  be  enrolled %0a%3c with  the  Gods.  And  hereof  came  the  Names  as  well  of  all %0a%3c other  Gods,  as  of  the  Stars  (which  I  have  mentioned  before), %0a%3c in  Recognisance  of  Men's  good  Deserts.  As  for  Jupiter  and %0a%3c Mercury,  and  others  ranged  among  the  Gods,  who  doubteth %0a%3c that  they  were  called  otherwise  among  themselves  ?  and  who %0a%3c confesseth  not  how  these  be  celestial  Denominations,  to  ex- %0a%3c press and  interpret  their  Nature  ? %0a%3c %0a%3c To  suppose  that  the  sovereign  Power,  whatsoever  it  is, %0a%3c should  exercise  Care  over  Mankind,  is  ridiculous.  For  can %0a%3c we  choose  but  believe  that  the  Godhead  must  be  polluted %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  37 %0a%3c %0a%3c with  so  base  and  manifold  a  Ministry  ?  And  hardly  can  it %0a%3c be  judged,  whether  it  be  better  for  Mankind  to  believe  that %0a%3c the  Gods  have  Regard  of  us,  or  that  they  have  none  ;  con- %0a%3c sidering that  some  Men  have  no  Respect  and  Reverence  for %0a%3c the  Gods,  and  others  so  much  that  their  Superstition  is  a %0a%3c Shame  to  them.  These  are  devoted  to  them  by  foreign  Cere- %0a%3c monies .-  they  wear  their  Gods  upon  their  Fingers  in  Rings, %0a%3c yea,  they  worship  Monsters  :  they  forbid  some  Meats ;  and %0a%3c yet  they  devise  others.  They  impose  upon  them  hard %0a%3c Charges,  riot  suffering  them  to  rest  and  sleep  in  quiet.  They %0a%3c choose  neither  Marriages,  nor  Children,  nor  any  one  Thing %0a%3c else,  but  by  the  Allowance  of  sacred  Rites.  Others  are  so %0a%3c godless,  that  in  the  very  Capitol  they  use  Deceit,  and  for- %0a%3c swear themselves  even  by  the  Thunder  of  Jupiter.  And  as %0a%3c some  speed  well  with  their  Irreligion,  so  others  suffer  from %0a%3c their  own  holy  Ceremonies. %0a%3c %0a%3c Between  these  Opinions,  Men  have  found  out  a  Medium %0a%3c of  Divine  Power,  to  the  End  that  there  should  be  a  still  more %0a%3c uncertain  Conjecture  regarding  God.  For  throughout  the %0a%3c whole  World,  in  every  Place,  at  all  Times,  and  in  all  Men's %0a%3c Mouths,  Fortune  alone  is  called  upon  :  she  only  is  named ; %0a%3c she  alone  is  blamed  and  accused.  None  but  she  is  thought %0a%3c upon ;  she  only  is  praised,  she  only  is  rebuked  ;  yea,  and %0a%3c worshipped  with  railing :  and  even  when  she  is  taken  to  be %0a%3c mutable  :  and  of  the  most  sort  supposed  also  to  be  blind : %0a%3c roving,  inconstant,  uncertain,  variable,  and  favouring  the %0a%3c Unworthy :  whatever  is  spent  and  lost,  whatever  is  gotten  : A %0a%3c and  in  all  Men's  Accounts  she  makes  up  the  Book.  Even %0a%3c the  very  Chance  of  Lots  is  taken  for  a  God,  by  which  God %0a%3c himself  is  shewn  to  be  uncertain. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  is  another  Sort  that  reject  Fortune,  but  attribute %0a%3c Events  to  their  Stars,  and  the  ascendant  of  their  Nativity : %0a%3c affirming  that  the  same  shall  ever  happen  which  once  hath %0a%3c been  decreed  by  God  :  so  that  he  for  ever  after  may  remain %0a%3c at  Rest.  And  this  Opinion  now  takes  deep  Root,  insomuch %0a%3c as  both  the  learned  and  the  ignorant  Multitude  agree  to  it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  Won  and  gotten,"  to  balance  "  spent  and  lost." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 38  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c From  hence  proceed  the  Admonitions  of  Lightnings,  the %0a%3c Foreknowledge  by  Oracles,  the  Predictions  of  Aruspices, %0a%3c yea,  and  other  contemptible  Things,  as  Auguries  of  Sneezing, %0a%3c and  stumbling  with  the  Foot.  Divus  Augustus  Ccesar  hath %0a%3c recorded  that  his  left-foot  Shoe  was  untowardly  put  on  be- %0a%3c fore the  right,  on  that  very  Day  when  he  had  like  to  have %0a%3c suffered  in  a  Mutiny  among  his  Soldiers. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus  all  these  Things  entangle  silly  Mortals,  so  that  this %0a%3c only  point  remaineth  certain — that  Nothing  is  certain :  nei- %0a%3c ther is  there  any  Thing  more  wretched  and  proud  than %0a%3c Man.  For  all  living  Creatures  beside  take  Care  only  for %0a%3c their  Food  :  wherein  Nature's  Goodness  of  itself  is  sufficient : %0a%3c which  one  Point  is  to  be  preferred  before  all  good  Things %0a%3c whatsoever,  inasmuch  as  they  never  think  of  Glory,  Riches, %0a%3c Ambition,  nor,  beyond  all  the  rest,  of  Death.  However,  the %0a%3c Belief  that  in  these  Matters  the  Gods  have  care  of  Men's %0a%3c Estate,  is  profitable  to  the  Course  of  Life :  as  also  that  the %0a%3c Punishment  of  Malefactors  will  come,  though  late  (whilst %0a%3c God  is  busily  occupied  in  so  huge  a  Frame  of  the  World), %0a%3c but  that  it  never  misseth  in  the  End :  and  that  Man  was  not %0a%3c made  so  near  in  Degree  unto  God,  for  this,  that  he  should %0a%3c be  almost  as  base  as  the  brute  Beasts.  Moreover,  the  chief %0a%3c Comfort  that  Man  hath,  for  his  Imperfections  in  Nature,  is %0a%3c this,  that  even  God  himself  cannot  do  all  Things.  For  nei- %0a%3c ther is  He  able  to  work  his  own  Death,  if  even  He  desired  it, %0a%3c as  He  hath  given  to  Man  as  his  best  Gift  when  he  is  weary %0a%3c of  the  Miseries  of  his  Life ;  nor  endow  Mortals  with  ever- %0a%3c lasting Life ;  nor  recall  the  Dead  to  Life  again ;  nor  bring  to %0a%3c pass  that  one  who  lived  did  not  live  ;  nor  he  that  bore %0a%3c honourable  Offices,  has  not  borne  them.  Nay,  He  hath  no %0a%3c Power  over  Things  past,  save  only  Oblivion  :  no  more  than %0a%3c He  is  able  to  effect  (to  come  with  Arguments  to  prove  our %0a%3c Fellowship  therein  with  God)  that  twice  ten  should  not  make %0a%3c twenty :  and  many  similar  Things.  Whereby  is  evidently %0a%3c proved  the  Power  of  Nature,  and  how  it  is  she  only  which  we %0a%3c call  God.  I  thought  it  not  impertinent  thus  to  digress  to %0a%3c these  Points,  by  Reason  of  ordinary  Questions  regarding  the %0a%3c Essence  of  God. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  39 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  VIII. %0a%3c Of  the  Nature  of  Planets,  and  their  Circuit. %0a%3c %0a%3c LET  us  return  now  to  the  Rest  of  Nature's  Works.  The %0a%3c Stars,  which  we  said  were  fixed  in  the  World,  are  not  (as  the %0a%3c common  Sort  thinketh)  assigned  to  every  one  of  us ;  namely, %0a%3c the  bright  for  the  rich ;  the  less  for  the  poor :  the  dim  for %0a%3c the  weak  and  feeble  :  neither  shine  they  out  more  or  less, %0a%3c according  to  the  Fortune  of  every  one,  nor  arise  they  each %0a%3c one  together  with  that  Person  unto  whom  they  are  appro- %0a%3c priated ;  and  die  likewise  with  the  same :  nor  yet  as  they  set %0a%3c and  fall,  do  they  signify  that  any  Body  is  dead.  There  is %0a%3c not  so  great  a  Society  between  Heaven  and  us,  that,  together %0a%3c with  the  Necessity  of  our  Death,  the  Light  of  the  Stars %0a%3c should  fade.  When  they  are  thought  to  fall,  they  do  but %0a%3c shoot  from  them  a  Quantity  of  Fire  out  of  that  Abundance %0a%3c of  Nutriment  which  they  have  gotten  by  the  Attraction  of %0a%3c Moisture  unto  them  :  like  as  we  also  observe  in  lighted %0a%3c Lamps  with  the  Liquor  of  Oil1.  The  celestial  Bodies,  which %0a%3c frame  the  World,  and  are  compact  together,  have  an  im- %0a%3c mortal Nature  :  and  their  Power  extendeth  much  to  the %0a%3c Earth  :  which  by  their  Operations,  Light  and  Greatness, %0a%3c might  be  known,  though  they  are  so  subtle  ;  as  we  shall  in %0a%3c due  Place  make  Demonstration.  The  Mariner  likewise  of  the %0a%3c heavenly  Circles  shall  be  shewn  more  fitly  in  our  "Geogra- %0a%3c phical Treatise  of  the  Earth  ;"  forasmuch  as  the  Consideration %0a%3c thereof  appertaineth  wholly  thereunto :  only  we  will  not  put %0a%3c off  the  Devisers  of  the  Zodiac,  wherein  the  Signs  are  placed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Obliquity  of  this,  Anaximander  the  Milesian  is %0a%3c reported  to  have  observed  first,  and  thereby  opened  the  Pas- %0a%3c sage to  Astronomy,  and  the  Knowledge  of  these  Things  : %0a%3c and  this  happened  in  the  fifty-eighth  Olympiad.  Afterwards %0a%3c Cleostratus  marked  the  Signs  therein  ;  and  those  first  of %0a%3c Aries  and  Sagittarius.  As  for  the  Sphere  itself,  Atlas  devised %0a%3c it  long  before.  For  the  present  we  will  leave  the  Body  of %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  See  note  2,  p.  63. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 40  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c the  starry  Heaven,  and  treat  of  all  the  rest  between  it  and %0a%3c the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Planet  which  they  call  Saturn*  is  the  highest,  and %0a%3c therefore  seemeth  to  be  least :  also  he  performeth  his  Revo- %0a%3c lution in  the  greatest  Circle  of  all  :  and  it  is  certain,  that  in %0a%3c thirty  Years'  Space  he  retnrneth  again  to  the  Point  of  his %0a%3c first  Place.  Moreover,  the  Motion  of  all  the  Planets,  and %0a%3c also  of  the  Sun  and  Moon,  go  a  contrary  Course  to  that  of %0a%3c the  starry  Heaven  ;  namely,  to  the  left  hand  [i.  e.  eastward]  ; %0a%3c whereas  the  said  Sky  itself  always  hasteneth  to  the  right %0a%3c [i.  e.  westward].  And  whereas  in  that  continual  turning %0a%3c with  exceeding  Celerity,  those  Planets  be  lifted  up  aloft,  and %0a%3c hurried  by  it  into  the  West,  and  there  set :  yet  by  a  contrary %0a%3c Motion  of  their  own,  they  pass  every  one  through  their %0a%3c several  Ways  eastward  ;  and  this  because  that  the  Air,  roll- %0a%3c ing ever  one  Way>  and  to  the  same  Part,  by  the  continual %0a%3c turning  of  the  Heaven,  should  not  grow  stagnant  whilst  the %0a%3c Globe  thereof  resteth  idle ;  but  should  be  minutely  divided %0a%3c by  the  violent  adverse  Action  of  these  Stars.  The  Planet %0a%3c Saturn  is  of  a  cold  and  frozen  Nature,  but  the  Circle %0a%3c of  Jupiter  is  much  lower  than  it,  and  therefore  his  Revo- %0a%3c lution is  performed  with  a  more  speedy  Motion,  in  twelve %0a%3c Years.  The  third,  of  Mars,  which  some  call  Hercules,  is %0a%3c fiery  and  ardent,  by  Reason  of  the  Sun's  Vicinity,  and  run- %0a%3c neth his  Race  in  about  two  Years.  And  it  is  by  the  exceed- %0a%3c ing Heat  of  Mars,  and  the  Cold  of  Saturn,  that  Jupiter,  who %0a%3c is  placed  betwixt,  is  well  tempered  of  them  both,  and  so  be- %0a%3c cometh  salutary.  Next  to  them  is  the  Course  of  the  Sun, %0a%3c consisting  of  360  Parts  [or  Degrees]  :  but  that  the  Observa- %0a%3c tion of  the  Shadows  which  he  casteth  may  return  again  to %0a%3c their  former  Marks,  five  Days  be  added  to  every  Year,  with %0a%3c the  fourth  Part  of  a  Day  over  and  above.  Whereupon,  in %0a%3c every  fifth  Year  one  odd  Day  is  added  to  the  Rest ;  to  the %0a%3c End  that  the  Reckoning  of  the  Seasons  may  agree  with  the %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  planets  since  discovered  —  two  of  them,  Herschel,  or  Uranus, %0a%3c and  the  new,  and  as  yet  unnamed,  star,  still  more  remote  than  it,  and  the %0a%3c others  exceedingly  small  —  must  have  been  beyond  the  reach  of  ancient %0a%3c observation,  from  ignorance  of  the  telescope.—  Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  41 %0a%3c %0a%3c Course  of  the  Sun.  Beneath  the  Sun  there  is  a  large  Star %0a%3c called  Venus,  which  wandereth  this  Way  and  that,  by  turns ; %0a%3c and  by  her  Names  testifieth  her  Emulation  of  the  Sun  and %0a%3c Moon.  For  while  she  anticipateth  the  Morning,  and  riseth %0a%3c Orientally,  she  taketh  the  Name  of  Lucifer,  as  a  second  Sun %0a%3c hastening  the  Day.  Contrariwise,  when  she  shineth  from %0a%3c the  West,  lengthening  the  Daylight,  and  supplying  the  Place %0a%3c of  the  Moon,  she  is  named  Vesper.  This  Nature  of  hers, %0a%3c Pythagoras  of  Samos  first  found  out,  about  the  42nd %0a%3c Olympiad  ;  which  was  the  142nd  Year  after  the  Foundation %0a%3c of  Rome.  Now  this  Planet,  in  Greatness,  exceedeth  all  the %0a%3c other  Stars :  and  so  shining  also,  that  the  Beams  of  this  Star %0a%3c only  cast  Shadows  upon  the  Earth.  And  hereupon  cometh %0a%3c such  great  Diversity  of  the  Names  thereof;  for  some  have %0a%3c called  it  Juno,  others  Isis,  and  others  the  Mother  of  the %0a%3c Gods.  By  the  natural  Efficacy  of  this  Star  all  Things  are %0a%3c generated  on  Earth.  For  whether  she  rise  in  the  East  or %0a%3c West,  she  sprinkleth  all  the  Earth  with  prolific  Dew,  and %0a%3c not  only  filleth  the  same  with  Seed,  but  stirreth  up  to  in- %0a%3c crease the  Nature  of  all  living  Creatures.  This  Planet  goeth %0a%3c through  the  Circle  of  the  Zodiac  in  348  Days,  departing %0a%3c from  the  Sun  never  above  46  Degrees,  as  Timceus  was  of %0a%3c Opinion.  Next  unto  it,  but  Nothing  of  that  Bigness  and %0a%3c Power,  is  the  Star  Mercury,  of  some  called  Apollo :  carried %0a%3c along  in  an  inferior  Circle,  after  the  like  Manner,  but  in %0a%3c a  swifter  Course  by  nine  Days  ;  shining  sometimes  before  the %0a%3c Sun  rising,  at  others  after  his  setting,  never  farther  distant %0a%3c from  him  than  23  Degrees,  as  both  the  same  Timceus  and %0a%3c Sosigenes  teach.  And  therefore  these  two  Planets  have  a %0a%3c peculiar  Consideration  from  others,  and  not  common  with %0a%3c the  rest  above-named.  For  those  are  seen  from  the  Sun %0a%3c a  fourth,  yea,  and  third  Part  of  the  Sky  :  oftentimes  also  in %0a%3c Opposition  against  the  Sun.  And  all  of  them  have  other %0a%3c greater  Circuits  of  full  Revolution,  which  are  to  be  spoken %0a%3c in  of  the  Discourse  of  the  great  Year1. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  enumeration  of  the  planets  here  given  is  on  the  Ptolemaic  sys- %0a%3c tem of  astronomy,  which  supposes  the  earth  to  be  fixed  in  the  centre  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42  .History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  IX. %0a%3c Of  the  Moons  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  the  Moon,  being  the  last  of  all,  most  familiar  with %0a%3c the  Earth,  and  devised  by  Nature  for  the  Remedy  of  Dark- %0a%3c ness, exceedeth  the  Admiration  of  all  the  rest.  She  with  her %0a%3c changing  in  many  Shapes,  hath  troubled  much  the  Minds  of %0a%3c Beholders,  angry  because  that  of  this  Star,  the  nearest  of  all, %0a%3c they  should  be  the  most  ignorant;  growing  as  it  doth,  or %0a%3c else  wasting  continually.  One  while  she  bended  into  Horns  ; %0a%3c another  while  divided  in  the  half,  and  again  moulded  into  a %0a%3c rounded  Figure :  spotted  sometime,  arid  soon  after,  on  a %0a%3c sudden,  exceeding  bright :  one  while  large  and  full,  and  sud- %0a%3c denly nothing  to  be  seen.  Sometime  shining  all  Night  long, %0a%3c and  at  others  late  ere  she  riseth ;  she  also  helpeth  the  Sun's %0a%3c Light  some  Part  of  the  Day;  eclipsed,  and  yet  visible  in %0a%3c that  Eclipse.  The  same  at  the  Month's  End  lieth  hidden, %0a%3c at  which  Time  (it  is  supposed)  she  laboureth  not.  At  one %0a%3c Time  she  is  below,  and  presently  aloft :  and  that  not  after %0a%3c one  Manner,  but  one  while  reaching  up  to  the  highest  Hea- %0a%3c ven, and  another  while  close  to  the  Mountains  ;  now  mounted %0a%3c to  the  North,  and  again  brought  down  to  the  South.  Which %0a%3c several  Motions  in  her,  the  first  Man  that  observed  was %0a%3c Endymion :  and  hence  sprung  the  Report  that  he  was  ena- %0a%3c moured of  the  Moon.  We  are  not  thankful,  as  we  ought  to %0a%3c be,  to  those  who  by  their  Labour  and  Care  have  given  us %0a%3c Light  in  this  Light ;  but  we  are  delighted  rather  (such  is  the %0a%3c wicked  Disposition  of  Man)  to  record  in  Chronicles,  Blood- %0a%3c shed and  Murders:  that  Men's  mischievous  Deeds  should  be %0a%3c known,  while  we  are  ignorant  of  the  World  itself.  The %0a%3c Moon  being  next  to  the  Centre,  and  therefore  of  least  Com- %0a%3c pass, performeth  the  same  Course  in  seven-and-twenty  Days, %0a%3c and  one-third  Part  of  a  Day :  which  Saturn,  the  highest %0a%3c Planet,  runneth  (as  we  said  before)  in  thirty  Years.

Likewise  that  she  loseth %0a%3c her  Light  (as  the  Rest  of  the  Planets)  by  the  Brightness  of %0a%3c the  Sun  when  she  approacheth  near.  For  she  shineth  by  bor- %0a%3c rowing of  him  her  Light,  much  like  to  that  which  we  see  in %0a%3c the  Reflexion  of  the  Sunbeams  from  the  Water.  And  here- %0a%3c upon it  is  that  she,  by  her  more  mild  and  imperfect  Power %0a%3c dissolveth,  and  also  increaseth,  so  much  Moisture  ;x  which %0a%3c the  Sunbeams  may  consume.  Hence  it  cometh  also,  that %0a%3c her  Light  is  not  equal  in  Sight,  because  it  is  only  when  she %0a%3c is  opposite  to  the  Sun  that  she  appeareth  full :  but  in  all %0a%3c other  days  she  sheweth  no  more  to  the  Earth  than  she  con- %0a%3c ceiveth  from  the  Sun.  In  Time  of  Conjunction,  she  is  not %0a%3c seen  at  all  :  for  that  whilst  she  is  turned  away,  all  the %0a%3c Draught  of  Light  she  casteth  back  again  from  whence  she %0a%3c received  it.  That  these  Stars  are  fed  with  earthly  Moisture, %0a%3c is  evident  by  the  Moon ;  which,  so  long  as  she  appeareth  by %0a%3c the  Half,  never  sheweth  any  Spots,  because  as  yet  she  hath %0a%3c not  her  full  Power  of  Light  sufficient  to  draw  Humour %0a%3c unto  her.  For  these  Spots  be  nothing  else  but  the  Dregs %0a%3c of  the  Earth,  caught  up  with  other  Moisture  among  the %0a%3c Vapours.2 %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Lucretius  supposes  that  all  animals,  and  all  the  stars,  are  fed  by %0a%3c exhalations  from  earth  and  air.  Lucian  also  expresses  the  same  idea.  And %0a%3c as  Pliny  was  of  an  adverse  sect  to  the  Epicureans,  and  consequently  did %0a%3c not  derive  it  from  them,  we  may  suppose  the  opinion  to  have  been  gene- %0a%3c rally received.

For  it  is  evident  that  the  Sun  is  hidden %0a%3c by  the  Intervention  of  the  Moon ;  and  the  Moon  again  by %0a%3c the  Opposition  of  the  Earth  :  as  also  that  the  one  doth  equal %0a%3c the  other,  in  that  the  Moon,  by  her  Interposition,  bereaveth %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  opinions  of  the  ancients  on  the  subject  of  Eclipses  were  two- %0a%3c fold:— that  of  the  vulgar  was  built  on  the  supposition  that  certain  sorce- %0a%3c rers, working  by  magic  art,  were  able  to  draw  this  planet  from  her  orbit, %0a%3c even  to  the  earth,  to  accomplish  their  nefarious  purposes  in  inflicting %0a%3c injury  on  particular  persons  or  on  communities.  They  were  supposed  to %0a%3c have  a  further  object  in  view,  by  compelling  her  to  deposit  on  some %0a%3c appropriate  herbs  a  foam  that  was  useful  in  magic  arts  :  as  we  learn  from %0a%3c Apuleius  and  Lucan.  Horace  represents  his  witch  Canidia  as  thus  en- %0a%3c gaged, in  his  5th  and  17th  Epodes.  Under  these  circumstances  the  moon %0a%3c was  supposed  to  labour  in  agony ;  and  the  method  taken  to  relieve  her %0a%3c throes,  and  prevent  her  total  extinction,  was  by  making  such  a  clamour %0a%3c that  the  verse  or  influence  might  not  ascend  to  her  sphere ;  and  by  not %0a%3c hearing,  her  dread  might  be  relieved.  Livy  speaks  of  this  clamour  as  an %0a%3c ordinary  occurrence  (lib.  xxvi.) ;  but  it  does  not  seem  to  have  been  an %0a%3c official  proceeding.  Another  opinion  was  founded  on  the  doctrines  of %0a%3c Divinity,  and  therefore  formed  a  portion  of  the  religion  of  the  state  :  the %0a%3c phenomena  being  regularly  observed,  reported,  and  registered  by  consti- %0a%3c tuted officers.  According  to  this  idea,  every  unusual  appearance  in  the %0a%3c sky  was  a  portent  of  some  coming  event  —  usually  of  an  awful  nature  — %0a%3c and  which  it  became  the  priesthood  to  avert,  by  those  processions,  sacri- %0a%3c fices, and  supplications,  that  were  appointed  in  the  sacred  books,  as  appro- %0a%3c priate to  each  appearance.  It  was  no  small  effort  of  courage,  as  well  as %0a%3c skill,  in  the  philosophers  whose  names  are  given  by  Pliny,  to  venture  to %0a%3c inquire  into  the  nature  and  causes  of  phenomena  which  must  have %0a%3c appeared  inscrutable  to  one  portion  of  the  public,  and  too  sacred  to  be %0a%3c meddled  with  to  the  other.  The  operation  of  both  opinions  appears  in %0a%3c the  narrative  that  Plutarch  gives  of  the  proceedings  of  Paulus  Emilius, %0a%3c preparatory  to  the  battle  with  the  Macedonians,  where,  while  the  aid  of %0a%3c the  philosopher,  Sulpitius  Gallus,  was  used  to  remove  their  fears,  his %0a%3c own  office  of  augur  was  not  neglected  to  work  on  their  superstitious %0a%3c confidence.—  Wern.

Neither  is  the  Night  any  Thing  else  but %0a%3c the  Shade  of  the  Earth.  The  Figure  of  this  Shadow  resem- %0a%3c bleth  a  Pyramid  pointed  forward,  or  a  Top  turned  upside %0a%3c down :  namely,  when  it  falleth  upon  it  with  its  sharp  End, %0a%3c and  goeth  not  beyond  the  Heights  of  the  Moon ;  for  no  other %0a%3c Star  is  in  that  Manner  darkened :  and  such  a  Figure  as  this %0a%3c always  endeth  in  a  Point.  And  that  Shadows  grow  to  No- %0a%3c thing in  a  great  Distance,  appeareth  by  the  exceeding  high %0a%3c Flight  of  some  Birds.  So  the  Confines  of  these  Shadows  is %0a%3c the  utmost  Bound  of  the  Air,  and  the  Beginning  of  Mther. %0a%3c Above  the  Moon  all  is  pure  and  lightsome  continually.  And %0a%3c we  in  the  Night  see  the  Stars  as  other  Lights  from  out  of %0a%3c Darkness.  For  these  Causes  also  the  Moon  is  eclipsed  only %0a%3c in  the  Night.  But  the  Reason  why  the  Sun  and  Moon  are %0a%3c not  both  in  the  Eclipse  at  set  Times  and  Monthly,  is  the %0a%3c Obliquity  of  the  Zodiac,  and  the  wandering  Turnings  of  the %0a%3c Moon  (as  hath  been  said):  and  because  these  Planets  do  not %0a%3c always  in  their  Motion  meet  just  in  the  Points  of  the  ecliptic %0a%3c Line,  that  is,  in  the  Head  or  Tail  of  the  Dragon. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XI. %0a%3c Of  the  Magnitude  of  Stars. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  this  Reason  that  lifteth  up  Men's  Minds  into  Hea- %0a%3c ven :  and  as  if  they  looked  down  from  thence,  discovereth %0a%3c unto  them  the  Magnitude  of  the  three  greatest  Parts  of %0a%3c Nature.  For  the  Sun's  Light  could  not  wholly  be  taken %0a%3c away  from  the  Earth,  by  the  Moon  coming  between,  if  the %0a%3c Earth  were  bigger  than  the  Moon.  But  the  Immensity  of %0a%3c the  Sun  is  more  certainly  known,  both  by  the  Shadow  of  the %0a%3c Earth  and  the  Body  of  the  Moon  :  so  that  it  is  needless  to %0a%3c inquire  into  the  Magnitude  thereof,  either  by  the  Proof  of %0a%3c Eyesight,  or  by  Conjecture  of  the  Mind.  How  immea- %0a%3c surable it  is,  appeareth  by  this,  that  Trees  which  are  planted %0a%3c in  Limits  from  East  to  West,  cast  Shadows  equal  in  Propor- %0a%3c tion ;  although  they  are  many  Miles  asunder  in  Length :  as %0a%3c if  the  Sun  were  in  the  Midst  of  them  all.  This  appeareth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 46  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c also  at  the  Time  of  the  Equinox  in  all  Regions  of  the  same %0a%3c Meridian,  when  the  Sun  shineth  directly  over  Men's  Heads, %0a%3c and  causeth  no  Shadow.  In  like  Manner,  the  Shadows  of %0a%3c them  that  dwell  northerly  under  the  solstitial  Circle,  fall  all %0a%3c at  Noontide,  northward,  but  at  Sunrising,  westward ;  which %0a%3c could  not  be  possible  unless  the  Sun  were  far  greater %0a%3c than  the  Earth.  Moreover,  when  he  riseth,  he  surpasseth %0a%3c in  breadth  the  Mountain  Ida,  encompassing  the  same  at %0a%3c large  both  on  the  right  Hand  and  the  left,  which  only  is %0a%3c from  being  so  far  distant.  The  Eclipse  of  the  Moon  sheweth %0a%3c also  the  Magnitude  of  the  Sun,  by  an  infallible  Demon- %0a%3c stration ;  as  his  own  Eclipse  declareth  the  Littleness  of  the %0a%3c Earth.  For  as  there  are  of  Shadows  three  Forms,  and  it  is %0a%3c evident,  that  if  the  dark  material  Body  which  casteth  a  Sha- %0a%3c dow be  equal  in  Bigness  to  the  Light,  then  the  Shadow  is %0a%3c fashioned  like  a  Pillar,  and  hath  no  Point  at  the  End :  if  it %0a%3c be  greater,  it  yieldeth  a  Shadow  like  a  Top  standing  upon %0a%3c the  Point,  so  as  the  lower  Part  thereof  is  narrowest,  and %0a%3c then  the  Shadow  likewise  is  of  infinite  length :  but  if  the %0a%3c Body  be  less  than  the  Light,  then  is  represented  a  pyramidal %0a%3c Figure,  falling  out  sharp-pointed  in  the  Top  ;  which  Manner %0a%3c of  Shadow  appeareth  in  the  Moon's  Eclipse :  it  is,  without %0a%3c doubt,  therefore,  that  the  Sun  is  much  larger  than  the %0a%3c Earth,  as  the  same  is  seen  by  the  silent  Proofs  of  Nature %0a%3c itself.  For  why,  in  dividing  the  Times  of  the  Year,  departeth %0a%3c the  Sun  from  us  in  the  Winter?  even  because  by  means %0a%3c of  the  Night's  length  he  may  refresh  the  Earth,  which %0a%3c otherwise  he  would  have  burnt  up  :  for,  notwithstanding %0a%3c this,  he  burneth  it  in  some  measure,  from  his  excessive %0a%3c Greatness. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XII. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Inventions  of  Men  in  the  Observation  of  the  Heavens. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  first  Roman  that  published  the  true  Reason  of  both %0a%3c Eclipses  was  Sulpitius  Gallus,  who  afterwards  was  Consul %0a%3c with  M.  Marcellus:  but  at  that  Time  being  a  Tribune,  the %0a%3c Day  preceding  that  on  which  King  Perseus  was  vanquished %0a%3c by  Paulus,  he  was  brought  by  the  General  into  open  Audi- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  47 %0a%3c %0a%3c ence  before  the  whole  Army,  to  foretel  the  Eclipse  which %0a%3c was  about  to  happen  :  whereby  he  delivered  the  Army  from %0a%3c Anxiety;  and  presently  after  he  compiled  a  Book  of  the %0a%3c same.  But  among  the  Greeks,  Thales  Milesius1  was  the  first %0a%3c that  investigated  it ;  who,  in  the  fourth  Year  of  the  48th %0a%3c Olympiad  did  foreshew  the  Sun's  Eclipse  that  happened  in %0a%3c the  Reign  of  Halyattes,  and  in  the  170th  Year  after  the %0a%3c Foundation  of  the  City  of  Rome.  After  them,  Hipparchus %0a%3c compiled  his  "  Ephemerides,"  containing  the  Course  and %0a%3c Aspects  of  both  these  Planets,  for  six  hundred  Years  en- %0a%3c suing :  comprehending  also  the  Months  according  to  the %0a%3c Reckonings  of  sundry  Nations,  the  Days,  the  Hours,  the %0a%3c Situation  of  Places,  the  Aspects,  and  Latitudes  of  divers %0a%3c Towns  and  Countries ;  as  the  World  will  bear  him  witness : %0a%3c and  that  no  less  assuredly,  than  if  he  had  been  privy  to %0a%3c Nature's  Counsels.  Great  Persons  and  excellent  these %0a%3c were,  doubtless,  who,  above  the  Reach  of  the  Capacity  of %0a%3c mortal  Men,  found  out  the  Reason  of  the  Course  of  such %0a%3c mighty  Stars  and  divine  Powers  :  and  whereas  the  Mind  of %0a%3c Men  was  before  at  a  Loss,  fearing  in  these  Eclipses  of  the %0a%3c Stars  some  great  Violence,  or  the  Death  of  the  Planets,  they %0a%3c secured  them  in  that  behalf :  in  which  dreadful  Fear  stood %0a%3c Stesickorus  and  Pindarus  the  Poets  (notwithstanding  their %0a%3c lofty  Style),  and  particularly  at  the  Eclipse  of  the  Sun,  as %0a%3c will  appear  by  their  Poems.  As  for  the  Moon,  Mortals %0a%3c imagine  that  at  that  Time  by  Charms  she  is  enchanted,  and %0a%3c therefore  help  her  by  dissonant  ringing  of  Basins.  In  this %0a%3c Terror,  Nicias,  the  General  of  the  Athenians  (as  a  Man  igno- %0a%3c rant of  the  Cause),  feared  to  set  sail  with  his  Fleet  out  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  minuteness  of  observation  displayed  by  these  illustrious  philo- %0a%3c sophers, from  whom  Pliny  has  borrowed  his  materials,  appears  to  imply %0a%3c the  existence  of  instruments  of  no  small  accuracy,  though  we  have  no %0a%3c account  of  their  possessing  such.  Of  the  telescope,  we  have  evidence  that %0a%3c they  were  ignorant. %0a%3c %0a%3c As  the  account  given  by  Pliny  of  ancient  astronomy  will  be  read %0a%3c chiefly  for  its  curiosity,  we  have  no  need  to  do  more  than  refer  to %0a%3c modern  treatises  on  the  subject  for  correction  of  what  is  mistaken. %0a%3c — Wem.

Neither  be  these %0a%3c Eclipses  seen  in  all  Places  when  they  are  above  the  Earth, %0a%3c by  Reason  sometimes  of  cloudy  Weather,  but  more  often,  for %0a%3c that  the  Globe  of  the  Earth  hindereth  the  Sight  of  the  Con- %0a%3c vexity of  the  Heaven.  Within  these  two  hundred  Years  it %0a%3c was  found  out  by  the  Sagacity  of  Hipparchus,  that  the  Moon %0a%3c sometime  was  eclipsed  twice  in  five  Months'  Space,  and  the %0a%3c Sun  likewise  in  seven.  Also  that  the  Sun  and  Moon  twice %0a%3c in  thirty  Days  were  darkened  above  the  Earth  :  though  this %0a%3c was  not  seen  equally  in  all  Quarters,  but  by  Men  in  divers %0a%3c Places :  and  that  which  is  most  surprising  in  this  Wonder, %0a%3c is,  that  when  it  is  agreed  that  the  Moon's  Light  is  dimmed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  49 %0a%3c %0a%3c by  the  Shadow  of  the  Earth,  at  one  Time  this  Eclipse  hap- %0a%3c peneth  in  the  West,  and  at  another  in  the  East :  as  also,  by %0a%3c what  Reason  it  happeneth,  that  seeing  after  the  Sun  is  up, %0a%3c that  Shadow  which  hideth  the  Light  of  the  Moon  must %0a%3c needs  be  under  the  Earth  :  it  fell  out  once,  that  the  Moon %0a%3c was  eclipsed  in  the  West,  and  both  Planets  were  seen  at  once %0a%3c above  the  Ground.  For  that  in  twelve  Days  both  these %0a%3c Lights  were  missing,  and  neither  Sun  nor  Moon  were  seen  :  it %0a%3c happened  in  our  Time,  when  both  the  Vespasians  (Emperors) %0a%3c were  Consuls,  the  Father  the  third  Time,  and  the  Son  the %0a%3c second. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIV. %0a%3c Of  the  Moons  Motion. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  clear  that  the  Moon,  always  in  her  increasing,  hath %0a%3c her  Horns  turned  from  the  Sun  toward  the  East :  but  in  her %0a%3c decrease,  contrariwise  westward ;  and  also  that  she  shineth %0a%3c (the  first  Day  of  her  Appearance)  three  quarters  and  the %0a%3c twenty-fourth  Part  of  one  Hour,  and  so  riseth  in  Proportion %0a%3c the  second  Day  forward  unto  the  full :  likewise  decreasing  in %0a%3c the  same  Manner  to  the  Change.  She  is  also  always  hidden %0a%3c in  the  Change  within  fourteen  Degrees  of  the  Sun.  By %0a%3c which  Argument  we  collect,  that  the  Magnitude  of  the  other %0a%3c Planets  is  greater  than  that  of  the  Moon,  because  they  ap- %0a%3c pear when  they  be  but  seven  Degrees  off.  But  the  Cause %0a%3c why  they  shew  less,  is  their  Altitude  :  like  the  fixed  Stars, %0a%3c which  by  Reason  of  the  Sun's  Brightness  are  not  seen  in %0a%3c the  Daytime  :  whereas,  indeed,  they  shine  as  well  by  Day  as %0a%3c Night:  and  that  is  manifestly  proved  by  Eclipses  of  the  Sun, %0a%3c and  by  exceeding  deep  Pits1,  for  so  they  are  to  be  seen  by %0a%3c Daylight. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  the  absence  or  imperfection  of  optical  instruments,  this  expedient %0a%3c was  necessarily  resorted  to,  for  the  purpose  here  stated ;  but  the  improve- %0a%3c ment of  the  telescope  has  superseded  this  contrivance.  There  was  for- %0a%3c merly, at  the  Royal  Observatory  at  Greenwich,  a  well  of  this  kind,  a %0a%3c hundred  feet  in  depth,  with  a  winding  staircase  of  stone  leading  to  the %0a%3c bottom ;  it  is  now  arched  over. —  Wern.

Afterwards  meeting  with  his  Rays,  they  are  covered  : %0a%3c and  in  their  triple  Aspect  retrograde,  they  make  their  Morn- %0a%3c ing Stations  120  Degrees  off,  which  are  called  the  first :  and %0a%3c by  and  by,  in  a  contrary  Aspect,  180  Degrees  off,  they  rise %0a%3c in  the  Evening,  and  appear  as  Evening  Stars.

The  other  two  inferior  Planets  are  hidden %0a%3c after  the  same  Manner  in  the  evening  Conjunction  :  and %0a%3c leaving  the  Sun  in  as  many  Degrees,  they  make  their  morn- %0a%3c ing Rising  :  and  from  the  farthest  Bounds  of  their  Distance, %0a%3c they  follow  after  the  Sun  :  and  after  they  have  once  over- %0a%3c taken him,  they  set  again  in  the  Morning,  and  so  outgo %0a%3c him.  And  by  and  by  keeping  the  same  Distance,  in  the %0a%3c Evening  they  rise  again  unto  the  same  Limits  which  we %0a%3c named  before,  from  whence  they  return  to  the  Sun,  and  by %0a%3c the  evening  Setting  they  be  hidden.  The  Star  Venus  like- %0a%3c wise maketh  two  Stations,  according  to  the  two  Manners  of %0a%3c her  Appearance,  Morning  and  Evening,  when  she  is  in  far- %0a%3c thest Bounds  of  her  Distance.  But  Mercury  keepeth  his %0a%3c Stations  so  small  awhile,  that  they  cannot  be  observed.  This %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  5 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c is  the  Order,  as  well  of  the  Appearances  of  the  Planets  as  of %0a%3c their  Occultations  and  their  mere  Motion,  enfolded  within %0a%3c many  strange  Wonders.  For  they  change  their  Magnitudes %0a%3c and  Colours,  and  sometimes  they  approach  to  the  North, %0a%3c sometimes  they  go  back  toward  the  South,  and,  all  on  a  sud- %0a%3c den, they  appear  one  while  nearer  to  the  Earth,  and  another %0a%3c while  to  the  Heaven  :  wherein,  if  we  shall  deliver  many %0a%3c Points  otherwise  than  former  Writers,  yet  we  confess,  that %0a%3c for  these  Matters  we  are  beholden  unto  them,  who  first  made %0a%3c Demonstration  of  seeking  out  the  Ways  thereto  :  and  there- %0a%3c fore let  no  Man  despair  of  profiting  and  going  forward  in %0a%3c Knowledge  from  Age  to  Age.  For,  these  strange  Motions %0a%3c fall  out  upon  many  Causes.  The  first  is  by  Reason  of  those %0a%3c Circles  in  the  Stars,  which  the  Greeks  call  Absides :  for  we %0a%3c are  compelled  to  use  the  Greek  Terms.  Each  one  of  the %0a%3c Planets  hath  a  particular  Circle  by  itself,  and  these  different %0a%3c from  those  of  the  starry  Heaven  :  because  the  Earth  from %0a%3c those  two  Points  which  they  call  Poles,  is  the  Centre  of  the %0a%3c Heaven,  as  also  of  the  Zodiac,  situated  obliquely  between %0a%3c them.  All  which  Things  are  certainly  known  to  be  so  be- %0a%3c yond Question  by  the  Compass.  And  therefore  from  every %0a%3c Centre  there  arise  their  own  Absides,  and  so  they  have %0a%3c diverse  Circuits  and  different  Motions,  because  of  necessity %0a%3c the  interior  Absides  must  be  shorter. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Why  the  same  Planets  seem  sometimes  higher,  and  sometimes %0a%3c %0a%3c lower. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  highest  Absides,  therefore,  from  the  Centre  of  the %0a%3c Earth  are  of  Saturn,  in  the  Sign  Scorpio :  of  Jupiter  in %0a%3c Virgo :  of  Mars  in  Leo :  of  the  Sun  in  Gemini :  of  Venus  in %0a%3c Sagittarius:  of  Mercury  in  Capricorn:  and  in  the  Middle  of %0a%3c the  said  Signs :  and  contrariwise  the  said  Planets  in  the %0a%3c same  Degrees  of  the  opposite  Signs  are  lowest  and  nearest %0a%3c to  the  Centre  of  the  Earth.  So  it  happeneth  that  they  seem %0a%3c to  move  more  slowly  when  they  go  their  highest  Circuit :  not %0a%3c for  that  natural  Motions  do  either  hasten  or  slacken,  which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 52  History  of  Nature.  [Boon.  ii. %0a%3c %0a%3c be  certain  and  several  to  every  one,  but  because  the  Lines %0a%3c which  are  drawn  from  the  Top  of  the  Absis  must  needs %0a%3c approach  each  other  about  the  Centre,  as  the  Spokes  in %0a%3c Wheels  :  and  the  same  Motion,  by  Reason  of  the  Nearness %0a%3c of  the  Centre,  seemeth  in  one  Place  greater,  in  another  less. %0a%3c The  other  Cause  of  their  Sublimities  is,  for  that  in  other %0a%3c Signs  they  have  the  Absides  elevated  highest  from  the %0a%3c Centre  of  their  own  eccentric  Circles.  Thus  Saturn  is  in  the %0a%3c greatest  Height  in  the  20th  Degree  of  Libra,  Jupiter  in  the %0a%3c 15th  of  Cancer,  Mars  in  the  28th  of  Capricorn,  the  Sun  in %0a%3c the  29th  of  Aries,  Venus  in  the  1 6th  of  Pisces,  Mercury  in %0a%3c the  15th  of  Virgo,  and  the  Moon  in  the  4th  of  Taurus.  The %0a%3c third  Reason  of  their  Altitude  is  not  taken  from  their  Circles, %0a%3c but  understood  by  the  Convexity  of  the  Sky,  for  that  these %0a%3c Planets  seem  to  the  Eye,  as  they  rise  and  fall,  to  mount  up %0a%3c or  settle  downward  through  the  air.  To  this  is  united  an- %0a%3c other Cause  also,  which  is,  the  Zodiac  Obliquity  and  Latitude %0a%3c of  the  Planets,  in  Regard  of  the  Ecliptic  :  for  through  it  the %0a%3c Stars  which  we  called  wandering  do  take  their  Course. %0a%3c Neither  is  there  any  Place  inhabited  upon  Earth,  but  that %0a%3c which  lieth  under  it.  For  all  the  Rest  without  the  Poles  are %0a%3c desert.  Only  the  Planet  Venus  goeth  beyond  the  Circle  of %0a%3c the  Zodiac,  two  Degrees  :  which  is  supposed  to  be  the  effi- %0a%3c cient Cause,  that  certain  living  Creatures  are  bred  even  in %0a%3c the  desert  Parts  of  the  World.  The  Moon  likewise  rangeth %0a%3c throughout  all  the  Breadth  of  it,  but  never  goeth  out  of  it. %0a%3c Next  after  these  the  Star  Mercury  hath  the  largest  Scope %0a%3c in  the  Zodiac,  but  yet  so,  as  of  twelve  Degrees  (for  that  is  the %0a%3c Breadth  thereof)  he  wandereth  but  eight,  and  those  not %0a%3c equally,  but  two  in  the  midst,  four  above,  and  two  beneath. %0a%3c Then  the  Sun  in  the  midst,  goeth  always  between  the  two %0a%3c Extremities  of  the  Zodiac ;  but  in  his  declining  Course  he %0a%3c seemeth  to  wind  unequally,  after  the  Manner  of  Serpents. %0a%3c Mars  leaveth  the  ecliptic  Line  four  half  Degrees,  Jupiter %0a%3c two  Degrees  and  a  half,  Saturn  two,  like  as  the  Sun.  Thus %0a%3c you  see  the  Manner  of  the  Latitudes,  as  they  descend  south- %0a%3c ward, or  ascend  northward.  And  upon  this  is  the  Reason %0a%3c grounded  of  the  third  Opinion  of  them,  who  imagine  that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  53 %0a%3c %0a%3c the  Planets  do  rise  and  mount  from  the  Earth  upward  into %0a%3c Heaven.  For  very  many  have  thought,  although  untruly, %0a%3c that  they  climb  in  this  Manner.  But  to  the  End  that  they %0a%3c may  be  confuted,  we  must  lay  open  an  immense  Subtlety, %0a%3c which  containeth  all  those  Causes  and  Reasons  abovesaid. %0a%3c First,  therefore,  this  is  admitted,  that  these  Stars  in  their %0a%3c Evening  Setting  are  nearest  to  the  Earth,  both  in  Latitude %0a%3c and  Altitude  :  and  when  they  be  farthest  from  the  Earth,  as %0a%3c well  in  Latitude  as  Elevation,  they  appear  in  the  Morning %0a%3c before  the  Sun  :  as  also  that  then  they  are  Stationaries  in  the %0a%3c middle  Points  of  the  Latitudes,  which  they  call  Ecliptics. %0a%3c Likewise  it  is  acknowledged,  that  so  long  as  the  Planets  are %0a%3c near  to  the  Earth,  their  Motion  increaseth  :  and  as  they  de- %0a%3c part on  hi«:h  it  decreaseth.  And  this  Reason  is  confirmed %0a%3c principally  by  the  Elevations  of  the  Moon.  And  it  is  beyond %0a%3c a  Doubt,  that  every  Planet  in  its  Morning  Rising  riseth %0a%3c every  Day  higher  than  the  former.  The  superior  three %0a%3c above  the  Sun  diminish  from  their  first  Stations  unto  the %0a%3c second.  Which  being  so,  it  will  plainly  appear,  that  every %0a%3c Planet  rising  before  the  Sun  ascendeth  to  the  Latitudes :  so %0a%3c that  from  the  Time  they  begin,  their  Motion  increaseth  by %0a%3c little  and  little  more  sparely.  But  in  the  first  Stations,  they %0a%3c are  at  the  highest  Altitude :  for  then  first  the  Numbers  begin %0a%3c to  be  withdrawn,  and  the  Planets  to  go  backward  ;  whereof %0a%3c a  particular  Reason  may  be  given  in  this  Manner :  the %0a%3c Planets  being  smitten  in  that  Part  whereof  we  spoke,  they %0a%3c are  both  restrained  by  the  triangular  Beams  or  trine  Aspect %0a%3c of  the  Sun,  to  hold  on  a  direct  Course,  and  are  raised  up %0a%3c aloft  by  the  fiery  Power  of  the  said  Sun.  This  cannot  im- %0a%3c mediately be  understood  by  our  Eyesight :  and  so  they  are %0a%3c supposed  to  stand,  and  hence  the  Name  of  Stations  is  de- %0a%3c rived. Then  proceedeth  forward  the  Violence  of  the  Sun's %0a%3c Beams,  and  the  Vapour  thereof,  by  Repercussion,  forceth %0a%3c them  to  go  backward.  And  much  more  is  this  perceived %0a%3c in  their  Evening  Rising,  when  the  Sun  is  wholly  against %0a%3c them,  and  they  be  driven  to  the  very  Top  of  their  Absides, %0a%3c and  so  not  seen  at  all,  because  they  are  at  the  highest,  and %0a%3c are  carried  on  by  their  least  Motion,  which  is  so  much  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 54  History  of  Nature.  [  BOOK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c less,  when  it  happeneth  in  the  highest  Signs  of  their  Absides. %0a%3c From  the  evening  Rising  the  Latitude  descendeth,  for  now  the %0a%3c Motion  less  diminisheth,  but  yet  increaseth  not  before  the %0a%3c second  Stations :  because  they  are  forced  to  descend  by  Rea- %0a%3c son of  the  Sunbeams  coming  from  the  other  Side  ;  and  the %0a%3c same  Force  beareth  them  downward  to  the  Earth,  which  by %0a%3c the  former  triangular  Aspect  raised  them  aloft  toward  Hea- %0a%3c ven. Of  so  much  Importance  is  it  whether  these  Beams %0a%3c come  from  beneath  or  above.  The  same  happeneth  much %0a%3c more  in  the  Evening  Setting.  This  is  an  Explanation  of %0a%3c the  Motions  of  the  superior  Planets;  but  the  Theory  of  the %0a%3c rest  is  more  difficult,  and  hath  by  no  Man  before  us  been %0a%3c delivered. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c General  Rules  concerning  the  Planets. %0a%3c %0a%3c FIRST,  therefore,  let  us  set  down  the  Cause  why  Venus %0a%3c never  departeth  from  the  Sun  more  than  forty-six  Degrees, %0a%3c and  Mercury  not  above  twenty-three  :  and  why  oftentimes %0a%3c they  retire  back  unto  the  Sun  within  that  Space.  To  be %0a%3c resolved  in  this  Point,  we  must  remark,  that  both  of  them %0a%3c have  their  Absides  turned  opposite  to  the  rest,  as  being %0a%3c seated  under  the  Sun  :  and  so  much  of  their  Circles  is  under- %0a%3c neath, as  the  forenamed  were  above ;  and  therefore  farther %0a%3c off  they  cannot  be,  because  the  Curvature  of  their  Absides %0a%3c in  that  Place  hath  no  greater  Longitude.  Therefore  both %0a%3c Margins  of  their  Absides,  by  a  like  Proportion,  keep  Mean, %0a%3c and  their  Course  is  limited :  but  the  short  Spaces  of  their %0a%3c Longitudes  they  compensate  by  the  wandering  of  their  Lati- %0a%3c tudes. But  what  is  the  Reason  that  they  reach  not  always %0a%3c to  forty-six  Degrees,  and  to  twenty-three?  They  do  so  truly: %0a%3c but  here  the  Explanation  fails.  For  it  is  apparent,  that  their %0a%3c Absides  also  move,  because  they  never  overpass  the  Sun. %0a%3c And  therefore  when  their  Margins  from  either  Side  are  per- %0a%3c ceived to  fall  upon  the  very  Point,  then  the  Planets  also  are %0a%3c understood  to  reach  unto  their  longest  Distances  :  but  when %0a%3c their  Margins  be  short  so  many  Degrees,  the  Stars  them- %0a%3c selves are  thought  to  return  more  speedily  in  their  Retro- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  55 %0a%3c %0a%3c gradation  than  in  their  direct  Course  forward,  though  their %0a%3c utmost  Extremity  is  ever  the  same.  And  from  hence  is  the %0a%3c Reason  understood  of  the  contrary  Motions  of  these  two %0a%3c Planets.  For  the  superior  Planets  move  most  swiftly  in  the %0a%3c Evening  Setting,  but  these  most  slowly.  They  be  highest %0a%3c above  the  Earth,  when  they  move  slowest ;  and  these,  when %0a%3c they  go  swiftest :  for  as  in  the  former  the  Nearness  of  the %0a%3c Centre  hasteneth  them,  so,  in  these,  the  Extremity  of  the %0a%3c Circle  :  they,  from  their  Morning  Rising,  begin  to  slacken %0a%3c their  Celerity ;  but  these  to  increase  it :  they  return  back %0a%3c from  their  Morning  Station  to  their  Evening  Mansion ;  but %0a%3c Venus,  contrariwise,  is  retrograde  from  the  Evening  Station %0a%3c to  that  of  the  Morning.  But,  she  from  the  Morning  Rising %0a%3c beginneth  to  climb  the  Latitude  :  but  to  follow  the  Altitude %0a%3c and  the  Sun  from  the  Morning  Station  :  as  being  most  swift %0a%3c and  at  the  highest  in  the  Morning  Setting.  Moreover  she %0a%3c beginneth  to  digress  in  Latitude,  and  to  diminish  her  Motion, %0a%3c from  the  Morning  Rising :  but  to  be  retrograde,  and  to  digress %0a%3c in  Altitude,  from  the  Evening  Station.  Again,  the  Planet %0a%3c Mercury  rising  in  the  Morning,  beginneth  both  Ways  to %0a%3c climb,  but  to  digress  in  Latitude  from  the  Evening  Rising : %0a%3c and  when  the  Sun  hath  overtaken  him  within  the  Distance %0a%3c of  fifteen  Degrees,  he  standeth  still  for  four  Days  almost %0a%3c immovable.  Presently,  he  descendeth  from  his  Altitude, %0a%3c and  goeth  back  from  the  Evening  Setting  to  that  of  the %0a%3c Morning.  This  Star  only,  and  the  Moon,  descend  in  as %0a%3c many  Days  as  they  ascend.  But  Venus  ascendeth  up  to  her %0a%3c Station  in  fifteen  Days  and  a  little  more.  Again,  Saturn  and %0a%3c Jupiter  are  twice  as  long  descending,  and  Mars  four  Times. %0a%3c So  great  Variety  is  in  their  Nature,  but  the  Reason  thereof  is %0a%3c evident.  For  they  which  go  against  the  Vapour  of  the  Sun %0a%3c do  also  descend  with  Difficulty.  Many  Secrets  more  of %0a%3c Nature,  and  Laws  whereunto  she  is  obedient,  might  be  shewn %0a%3c about  these  Things.  As,  for  Example:  the  Planet  Mars, %0a%3c whose  Course,  of  all  others,  can  be  least  observed,  never %0a%3c maketh  Station  but  in  quadrate  Aspect :  and  Jupiter,  in %0a%3c triangular  Aspect ;  and  very  seldom  separated  from  the  Sun %0a%3c sixty  Degrees,  which  Number  maketh  six  angled  Forms  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 56  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c the  Heaven  (that  is,  it  is  the  sixth  Part  of  the  Heaven) : %0a%3c neither  doth  Jupiter  shew  his  rising  in  any,  save  only  two %0a%3c Signs,  Cancer  and  Leo.  The  Planet  Mercury  seldom  hath %0a%3c his  Evening  Rising  in  Pisces,  but  very  often  in  Virgo  ;  and %0a%3c the  Morning  Rising  in  Libra.  In  like  Manner,  the  Morning %0a%3c Rising  is  in  Aquarius,  but  very  seldom  in  Leo.  Neither %0a%3c becometh  he  retrograde  in  Taurus  and  Gemini  :  and  in %0a%3c Cancer,  not  under  the  twenty-fifth  Degree.  As  for  the %0a%3c Moon,  she  entereth  not  twice  in  Conjunction  with  the  Sun %0a%3c in  any  other  Sign  but  Gemini :  and  sometime  hath  no  Con- %0a%3c junction at  all,  and  that  only  in  Sagittarius.  As  for  the  last %0a%3c and  first  of  the  Moon,  to  be  seen  in  the  same  Day  or  Night, %0a%3c happeneth  in  no  other  Sign  but  in  Aries,  and  few  Men  have %0a%3c had  the  Chance  to  see  it.  And  hereupon  came  Linceus  to  be %0a%3c so  famous  for  his  Eyesight.  Also,  the  Planets  Saturn  and %0a%3c Mars  appear  not  in  the  Heaven  at  the  most  170  Days: %0a%3c Jupiter  36,  or  at  least  ten  Days  wanting  :  Venus  69,  or  when %0a%3c least,  52 :  Mercury  13,  or  at  least,  17. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XVIII. %0a%3c What  is  the  Cause  that  the  Planets  alter  their  Colours  ? %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Reason  of  the  Planet's  Altitudes  is  it  that  tetnpereth %0a%3c their  Colours,  for  they  take  the  Likeness  of  the  Air,  into %0a%3c which  they  enter ;  and  the  Circle  of  another  Planet's  Motion %0a%3c coloureth  them  as  they  approach  either  Way,  ascending  or %0a%3c descending.  The  colder  setteth  a  pale  Colour,  the  hotter  a %0a%3c red,  and  the  windy  a  fearful  Hue.  Only  the  Points  and %0a%3c Conjunctions  of  iheAbsides,  and  the  utmost  Circumferences, %0a%3c shew  a  dark  black.  Each  Planet  hath  a  several  Colour; %0a%3c Saturn  is  white,  Jupiter  clear  and  bright,  Mars  a  fiery  red, %0a%3c Venus  glowing,  when  Lucifer;  when  Occidental,  or  Vesper, %0a%3c resplendent  ;  Mercury  sparkling,  the  Moon  pleasant,  the %0a%3c Sun  when  he  riseth,  burning,  afterwards  radiating1.  Upon %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Many  of  the  colours  here  mentioned  are  only  optical  deceptions,  but %0a%3c that  of  the  planet  Mars  must  proceed  from  something  inherent  in  the %0a%3c planet  itself,  or  the  atmosphere  by  which  it  is  surrounded ;  for  while %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  57 %0a%3c %0a%3c these  Causes  the  Sight  is  entangled,  and  discovereth  those %0a%3c Stars  also  which  are  fixed  in  the  Sky.  For  one  while  a %0a%3c Number  of  them  appear  about  the  Half-moon,  when  in  a %0a%3c clear  and  calm  Night  she  gently  beautlfieth  them ;  and  at %0a%3c another  they  are  seen  but  here  and  there,  insomuch  that  we %0a%3c may  wonder  how  they  are  fled  upon  the  full  Moon,  which %0a%3c hideth  them  ;  or  when  the  Beams  either  of  the  Sun  or  other %0a%3c abovesaid  have  dazzled  our  Sight.  Yea,  the  Moon  herself %0a%3c perceiveth  the  Sun's  Beams,  as  they  come  upon  her :  for %0a%3c those  Rays  that  come  sidelong,  according  to  the  Convexity %0a%3c of  the  Sky,  give  but  an  obscure  Light  to  the  Moon,  in  Com- %0a%3c parison of  them  that  fall  directly  with  straight  Angles.  And, %0a%3c therefore,  in  the  quadrangular  Aspect  of  the  Sun  she  ap- %0a%3c peareth  divided  in  Half;  in  the  triangular  she  is  well  near %0a%3c environed,  but  her  Circle  is  half  empty ;  but  in  Opposition %0a%3c she  appeareth  full.  And  again,  as  she  is  in  the  Wane,  she %0a%3c representeth  the  same  Forms,  decreasing  by  Quarters  as  she %0a%3c increased  :  with  like  Aspects  as  the  other  three  Planets %0a%3c above  the  Sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  Reason  of  the  Suns  Motion,  and  the  Inequality  of  Days. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Sun  himself  hath  four  Differences  in  his  Course  : %0a%3c twice  in  the  Year,  in  Spring  and  Autumn,  making  the  Night %0a%3c equal  to  the  Day ;  for  then  he  falleth  on  the  Centre  of  the %0a%3c Earth,  in  the  eighth  Degree  of  Aries  and  Libra.  Twice %0a%3c likewise  he  exchangeth  the  Compass  of  his  Race  :  to  lengthen %0a%3c the  Day  from  the  Bruma,  or  Midwinter,  in  the  eighth  De- %0a%3c gree of  Capricorn;  and  again  to  lengthen  the  Night  from  the %0a%3c summer  Solstice,  being  in  as  many  Degrees  of  Cancer.

Therefore,  as  out  of  burning  Wood  a  Coal  of %0a%3c Fire  flieth  forth  with  a  Crack,  so  from  a  Star  is  spit  out  this %0a%3c celestial  Fire,  carrying  with  it  Presages  of  future  Things :  so %0a%3c that  it  sheweth  Divine  Operations,  even  in  these  Portions %0a%3c which  are  cast  away  as  superfluous.  And  this  most  com- %0a%3c monly happeneth  when  the  Air  is  troubled;  either  because %0a%3c the  collected  Moisture  stirreth  that  Abundance  to  fall ;  or %0a%3c because  it  is  disquieted,  as  it  were,  with  a  Birth  from  a %0a%3c pregnant  Star. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Much  of  the  religious  system  of  the  ancients  was  founded  on  the %0a%3c persuasion  that  every  appearance  of  lightning  and  thunder,  as  well  as %0a%3c other  aerial  phenomena,  were  direct  manifestations  of  Divine  interposition %0a%3c in  the  affairs  of  men ;  and  a  college  of  officers  (augurs)  was  appointed  to %0a%3c observe,  record,  report,  and  explain  such  appearances,  for  the  guidance  of %0a%3c the  state  in  its  most  important  proceedings.  From  a  slight  expression  of %0a%3c Pliny  in  the  course  of  this  chapter,  it  appears  that  he  hesitated  to  deny %0a%3c this  popular  idea  in  a  direct  manner  :  in  apprehension,  perhaps,  of  laying %0a%3c himself  open  to  the  charge  of  infidelity.  But  by  implication,  he  expresses %0a%3c his  disbelief  of  what  was  so  generally  credited;  for  the  ascribing  to  the %0a%3c natural  effect  of  Jupiter  as  a  planet,  what  was  believed  by  the  priests  and %0a%3c the  state  to  be  a  voluntary  action  of  Jupiter,  the  supreme  deity,  can  be %0a%3c regarded  as  little  better  than  a  subterfuge.

But  Pytha- %0a%3c goras, a  Man  of  much  Sagacity,  hath  collected,  that  there %0a%3c are  126,000  Stadia1  from  the  Earth  to  the  Moon,  and  a %0a%3c double  Distance  from  her  to  the  Sun,  and  from  thence  to  the %0a%3c twelve  Signs  three  Times  so  much.

But %0a%3c from  her  to  the  Sun  so  much  and  a  Half  more  :  but  from  the %0a%3c Sun  to  Mars  a  Tone,  that  is  to  say,  as  much  as  from  the %0a%3c Earth  to  the  Moon.  From  him  to  Jupiter  Haifa  Tone: %0a%3c likewise  from  him  to  Saturn  Half  a  Tone  :  and  so  from %0a%3c thence  to  the  Zodiac  so  much  and  a  Half  more.  Thus  are %0a%3c composed  seven  Tunes,  which  Harmony  they  call  Diapason; %0a%3c that  is  to  say,  the  Universality  of  Consent.  In  this,  Saturn %0a%3c rnoveth  by  the  Doric  Tune ;  Mercury  by  Phthongus,  Jupiter %0a%3c by  the  Phrygian,  and  the  Rest  likewise :  a  Subtlety  more %0a%3c pleasant  than  needful2. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Stadium  differed  in  different  countries ;  but  the  standard  may %0a%3c be  fixed  at  a  furlong ;  as  may  be  seen  in  chapter  xxiii.

Posidonius  saith,  that  from  the  Earth  it  is  no  less  than %0a%3c forty  Stadia  to  that  Height  wherein  thick  Weather,  Winds, %0a%3c and  Clouds  are  formed.  Above  this,  the  Air  is  pure,  clear, %0a%3c and  light,  without  any  troubled  Darkness.  But  from  the %0a%3c cloudy  Region  to  the  Moon  is  2,000,000  Stadia :  from  thence %0a%3c to  the  Sun,  5000.

But,  as  often  happens,  when  philosophers  confine %0a%3c their  views  of  Nature  to  a  single  aspect,  what  has  a  shadow  of  truth  in %0a%3c itself  becomes,  when  thus  interpreted,  egregious  trifling.  The  supposition %0a%3c enounced  is,  that  not  only  are  the  motions  performed  according  to  musical %0a%3c time,  but  the  intervals  between  the  chords  (of  each  planet's  path)  are %0a%3c properly  measured  by  their  relative  tones.

Many  there  be,  however,  who  have  taught  that %0a%3c the  Clouds  are  elevated  to  the  Height  of  900  Stadia.  These %0a%3c Points  are  undiscovered,  and  beyond  Man's  Reach  ;  but  they %0a%3c may  now  be  delivered  to  others,  as  they  have  been  taught : %0a%3c in  which,  notwithstanding,  one  infallible  Reason  of  a  geome- %0a%3c trical Collection  cannot  be  rejected,  if  a  man  would  search %0a%3c deep  into  these  Matters.  Neither  need  a  Man  to  seek  an %0a%3c exact  Measure  hereof  (for  to  desire  that  is  a  foolish  Idleness), %0a%3c but  only  to  make  an  Estimate  of  Probability.  For,  whereas %0a%3c it  is  clear  by  the  Course  of  the  Sun,  that  the  Circle  through %0a%3c which  he  passeth  containeth  three  hundred,  threescore,  and %0a%3c almost  six  Degrees  ;  and  it  is  a  Rule  that  the  Diameter %0a%3c formeth  a  third  Part  of  the  Circumference,  and  little  less %0a%3c than  a  seventh  Part  of  a  third :  it  is  plain,  that  deducting %0a%3c one  Half  thereof  (because  the  Earth,  situated  in  the  Centre, %0a%3c cometh  between),  about  the  sixth  Part  of  this  great  Circuit %0a%3c which  he  maketh  about  the  Earth  (so  far  as  our  Mind  doth %0a%3c comprehend),  is  the  very  Height  from  the  Earth  up  to  the %0a%3c Sun,  but  the  twelfth  Part  to  the  Moon,  because  she  runneth %0a%3c so  much  a  shorter  Circuit  than  the  Sun  ;  whereby  it  ap- %0a%3c peareth,  that  she  is  in  the  Midst  between  the  Earth  and  the %0a%3c Sun.  It  is  a  Wonder  to  see  how  far  the  Presumption  of  the %0a%3c Heart  of  Man  will  proceed  when  instigated  by  some  little %0a%3c Success,  as  in  the  abovenamed  Matter.  The  Reason  whereof %0a%3c ministereth  plenteous  Occasion  of  Impudency,  for  they  who %0a%3c dared  to  give  a  Guess  at  the  Space  between  the  Sun  and  the %0a%3c Earth  are  so  bold  as  to  do  the  like  from  thence  to  Heaven. %0a%3c For,  presuming  that  the  Sun  is  in  the  Midst,  they  have  at %0a%3c their  Fingers'  Ends  the  very  Measure  of  the  whole  World. %0a%3c For  how  many  seven  Parts  the  Diameter  hath,  so  many %0a%3c twenty-two  Parts  hath  the  whole  Circle :  as  if  they  had  got- %0a%3c ten the  certain  Measure  of  the  Heaven  by  the  Plumb-line. %0a%3c The  Egyptians,  according  to  the  Reckoning  which  Petosiris %0a%3c and  Necepsos  have  invented,  do  collect,  that  every  Degree  in %0a%3c the  Circle  of  the  Moon,  which  is  the  least  (as  hath  been  said) %0a%3c of  all  other,  containeth  thirty-three  Stadia,  and  somewhat %0a%3c more;  in  Saturn^  the  greatest  of  all,  double  as  much  ;  and  in %0a%3c the  Sun,  which  we  said  was  the  midst,  the  Half  of  both  Mea- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62  History  of  Nature.

But  it  is  to  be  remarked,  that  Pliny  classes  meteors  and %0a%3c shooting  stars,  not  only  with  comets,  but  also  among  the  more  permanent %0a%3c or  fixed  stars. —  Wern.

It  is %0a%3c thought  to  be  material  for  Presage,  to  observe  into  what %0a%3c Quarters  it  shooteth,  or  what  Star's  Power  and  Influence  it %0a%3c receiveth  :  also  what  Similitudes  it  resernbleth,  and  in  what %0a%3c Parts  it  first  shineth  out.

For,  that  Joy  of  his  he  testified  in  these %0a%3c Words :  In  those  very  Days  of  my  Games,  there  was  seen  a %0a%3c Comet  for  seven  Days  together,  in  that  Region  of  the  Sky %0a%3c which  is  under  the  North  Star.  It  arose  about  the  eleventh %0a%3c Hour  of  the  Day,  bright  and  clear,  and  evidently  seen  in  all %0a%3c Lands.  By  that  Star  it  was  signified  (as  the  common  Sort %0a%3c believed)  that  the  Soul  of  (Julius)  Csesar  was  received  among %0a%3c the  Divine  powers  of  the  immortal  Gods.  In  which  regard, %0a%3c that  Mark  of  a  Star  was  set  on  the  Head  of  the  Statue  of %0a%3c Julius  Caesar,  which  soon  after  we  dedicated  in  the  Forum. %0a%3c These  Words  he  published  abroad  :  but  in  a  more  inward %0a%3c Joy  to  himself,  he  interpreted  that  this  Comet1  was  made  for %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  is  a  strong  proof  of  the  popular  bias  at  that  time,  as  well  as  of  the %0a%3c political  tact  of  Augustus,  that  he  was  so  far  able  to  dissipate  the  appre- %0a%3c hensions usually  entertained  on  the  appearance  of  a  comet,  as  to  convert %0a%3c the  phenomenon  into  a  prognostic  of  especial  good  to  his  government ; %0a%3c and  to  associate  with  it,  what  he  wished  them  to  believe  of  the  Divine %0a%3c adoption  of  his  deceased  uncle,  the  Dictator.     The  latter  had,  indeed,  al- %0a%3c ready given  him  some  examples  of  the  art  of  overruling  a  portent,  when %0a%3c its  understood  meaning  did  not  correspond  with  his  wishes ;  and  Suetonius %0a%3c observes,  that  no  ominous  presage  could  ever  deter  or  divert  him  from %0a%3c the  prosecution  of  his  designs.    That  this  celestial  phenomenon,  which %0a%3c appeared  about  an  hour  before  sunset,  and  was  seen  for  seven  successive %0a%3c days,  excited  much  attention,  appears  from  Ovid  ("  Metamorphoses," %0a%3c b.  xv.),  who  speaks  of  it  as  if  he  wished  to  avoid  the  dreaded  name  of %0a%3c Comet,  a  word  which,  in  the  original,  Pliny  also  does  not  use : — %0a%3c "  Dumque  tulit,  lumen  capere,  atque  ignescere  sensit, %0a%3c Emisitque  sinu.

Dalechamp  mentions  a  Roman  coin,  bearing  on  the  obverse %0a%3c the  head  and  inscription  of  the  deified  Caesar,  and,  on  the  reverse,  a  temple %0a%3c of  Venus,  with  a  star,  and  a  statue  of  Caesar  in  the  augural  dress,  and  an %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (From  a  Coin  in  the  British  Museum.) %0a%3c %0a%3c altar  for  offerings  and  vows,  with  the  inscription,  "  Divo  Julio."

The %0a%3c origin  of  this  story  of  the  star  of  Venus  may  be  traced  to  a  Phoenician  or %0a%3c Trojan  source ;  for  we  find,  in  the  Fragments  of  Sanchoniatho,  the  fol- %0a%3c lowing account : — "  But  travelling  about  the  world,  she  found  a  star  fall- %0a%3c ing from  the  sky ;  which  she,  taking  up,  consecrated  in  the  Holy  Island %0a%3c Tyre.  And  the  Phoenicians  say,  that  Astarte  is  she  who  is  amongst  the %0a%3c Greeks  called  Aphrodite:' — (Bishop  Cumberland's  Trans,  p.  36.)  This %0a%3c Tyrian  or  Trojan  deity  was  the  Marine  Venus,  and  is  to  be  distinguished %0a%3c from  Venus  Urania,  the  heavenly,  the  greatest ;  who,  according  to  Cicero, %0a%3c (N.  D.  iii.  23.)  and  other  authority,  was  the  Syrian  Astarte,  and  the %0a%3c Ashteroth  of  sacred  Scripture ;  whose  ensigns  were :  on  her  head,  the %0a%3c horns  of  a  bull ;  about  her,  thunderbolts ;  and  round  her,  many  stars. %0a%3c Lucian,  describing  her  statue,  which  he  had  seen,  says :  "  She  had  a  splen- %0a%3c did stone  on  her  head,  which  was  called  xvx»b,  which  in  the  night  gave %0a%3c much  light  to  the  temple,  but  shone  weakly  in  the  day-time,  and  looked %0a%3c like  fire.  Nor  were  these,  the  Roman  deities  Venus  and  Juno,  the  only %0a%3c powers  that  were  designated  by  a  star.

The  same  Man  went  so  far,  that  he  attempted  (a %0a%3c Thing  even  hard  for  God  to  perform)  to  deliver  unto  Pos- %0a%3c terity the  exact  Number  of  the  Stars.  He  brought  the  said %0a%3c Stars  within  the  Compass  of  Rule,  by  devising  certain  In- %0a%3c struments to  take  their  several  Places,  and  set  out  their %0a%3c Magnitudes  :  that  thereby  it  might  be  easily  discerned,  not %0a%3c only  whether  the  old  died,  and  new  were  born,  but  also %0a%3c whether  they  moved,  and  which  Way  they  took  their  Course? %0a%3c likewise,  whether  they  increased  or  decreased?  Thus  he  left %0a%3c the  Inheritance  of  the  Sky  unto  all  Men,  if  any  one  haply %0a%3c could  be  found  able  to  enter  upon  it  as  lawful  Heir. %0a%3c %0a%3c There  be  also  certain  flaming  Torches  shining  out  in  the %0a%3c Sky,  though  they  are  never  seen  but  when  they  fall.  Such %0a%3c an  one  was  that  which,  at  the  Time  that  Germanicus  Ccesar %0a%3c exhibited  a  Show  of  Gladiators,  passed  at  Noontide  in  the %0a%3c %0a%3c refers  to  a  male  deity,  that,  so  early  as  the  days  of  Moses,  was  worshipped %0a%3c in  a  portable  shrine  by  the  people  of  Israel,  and  by  them  probably  derived %0a%3c from  Egypt.  A  star  thus  became  associated  with  the  idea  of  Divine %0a%3c benignity ;  and  how  widely  so,  appears  from  the  history  of  the  Magi, %0a%3c who  came  from  the  East  to  Jerusalem,  to  seek  out  the  Desire  of  all  Nations, %0a%3c in  pursuance  of  a  prophecy  that  must  have  been  of  the  highest  antiquity. %0a%3c —  Wern.

And %0a%3c these  Things  I  suppose  to  come  at  certain  Times  by  Course %0a%3c of  Nature,  like  other  Things;  and  not,  as  the  most  Part %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Showers  of  blood  have  been  recorded  in  chronicles  of  various  ages ; %0a%3c and  in  those  turbulent  times  it  was  never  difficult  to  find  some  public %0a%3c evil  which  such  unwonted  phenomena  might  be  supposed  to  have  fore- %0a%3c told. By  modern  inquiry  these  appearances  have  been  ascribed  to  the %0a%3c excrements  of  a  mighty  swarm  of  butterflies — to  the  extraordinary  abun- %0a%3c dance of  an  animalcula,  called  Oscellatoria  Vubesuns —  and  to  the  red %0a%3c vegetable  Protococcus  Nivalis,  swept  up  by  winds  from  the  snow,  on  which %0a%3c it  naturally  grows.  None  of  these  explanations,  however,  appear  to  an- %0a%3c swer so  completely  to  Pliny's  account,  as  the  following;  to  which  the %0a%3c Editor  was  once  a  witness.  On  the  15th  of  February,  1837,  when  the %0a%3c weather  had  long  been  damp,  misty,  and  rather  windy  —  the  direction  of %0a%3c the  wind  being  South  of  West  —  at  a  quarter  of  an  hour  after  five  in  the %0a%3c evening,  there  came  in  a  mist,  of  a  bright  red  colour ;  which  attracted %0a%3c attention,  through  a  window,  by  the  glare  of  light  it  diffused.  On  pro- %0a%3c ceeding to  examine  it  in  the  open  air,  it  was  observed  to  have  become  of %0a%3c a  pink  colour ;  and  presently  passing  into  violet,  it  settled  into  a  grey ;  in %0a%3c which  tint  it  remained  until  the  evening  hid  it  from  view.  No  refraction %0a%3c of  sunbeams  can  be  allowed  to  account  for  this  appearance ;  for  the  sun %0a%3c had  long  before  been  hidden  by  intervening  hills  from  the  valley  in %0a%3c which  this  beautiful  coloured  mist  appeared.—  Wern.

Records  of  those  things  would  scarcely  have  been  found  in  the %0a%3c books  of  the  augurs,  if  some  political  object  had  not  been  mixed  with  the %0a%3c report  of  the  occurrences.  It  is  well  known  that  during  the  Republican %0a%3c days  of  Rome,  the  reckoning  of  dates  by  the  years  of  the  consuls  was %0a%3c the  common  order  of  chronology.  The  consulship  of  L.  Opimius  and %0a%3c Q.  Fabius  Maximus  was  in  the  630th  year  of  Rome,  and  123  years  before %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70  History  of  Nature.

That  the  former  of  these  consuls  was  capable  of  any %0a%3c violence  or  fraud,  to  secure  political  preponderance,  appears  from  his  his- %0a%3c tory in  connexion  with  the  Gracchi.  He  was  openly  accused  of  forging %0a%3c portents ;  and  when  one  of  his  lictors  had  knocked  down  Tiberius  Grac- %0a%3c chus, whose  person  as  tribune  was  sacred,  in  the  riots  that  followed  he %0a%3c offered  a  reward,  of  its  weight  in  gold,  for  the  head  of  his  opponent.  The %0a%3c bribe  was  successful :  the  head  was  found  to  weigh  171bs.  8oz. ;  and  to %0a%3c shew  his  pious  gratitude  for  the  result,  as  well,  perhaps,  as  to  divert %0a%3c public  attention,  he  built  a  temple  to  Concord.— Wern.

They  are  dangerous  when  they %0a%3c come  singly,  for  they  sink  those  Ships  on  which  they  alight ; %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Luminous  meteors  are  mostly  seen  at  night ;  since  daylight  is  too %0a%3c powerful  to  allow  them  to  be  seen.  They  have  not  been  studied  as  the %0a%3c subject  deserves ;  and  hence  the  futility  of  the  explanations  generally %0a%3c given  to  their  causes.  There  is  little  doubt,  that  they  differ  greatly  in %0a%3c nature.  Some  are  undoubtedly  electric;  as  may  be  judged  from  their %0a%3c sudden  explosion,  sometimes  with  signs  of  great  violence.  The  appear- %0a%3c ances termed  Castor  and  Pollux,  and  among  modern  sailors  Corbisant,  or %0a%3c Corpo  Santo,  is  exceedingly  rare  on  land,  and  in  the  British  seas ;  but %0a%3c common  in  warmer  latitudes  than  Britain.

And  therefore  it  is,  that  Men  assign  this  mighty %0a%3c Power  to  Castor  and  Pollux,  and  invocate  them  as  Gods  at %0a%3c Sea.  Men's  Heads,  also,  in  the  Evening  are  seen  to  shine %0a%3c round  about ;  which  presageth  some  great  Matter.  Of  all %0a%3c these  Things  there  is  no  certain  Reason  to  be  given  ;  but  they %0a%3c are  hidden  in  the  Majesty  of  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXVIII. %0a%3c Of  the  Air. %0a%3c %0a%3c HITHERTO  we  have  treated  of  the  World  itself,  and  the %0a%3c Stars.  It  remaineth  now  to  speak  of  other  memorable %0a%3c Things  observed  in  the  Sky.  For  even  that  Part  also  have %0a%3c our  Forefathers  called  Cesium,  or  the  Sky,  which  otherwise %0a%3c they  name  the  Air :  even  all  that  Portion  which  seeming %0a%3c like  a  void  and  empty  Place,  yieldeth  this  vital  Spirit %0a%3c whereby  all  Things  do  live.  This  Region  is  seated  beneath %0a%3c the  Moon,  and  far  under  that  Planet  (as  I  observe  it  is,  in %0a%3c Manner,  by  all  Men  agreed  upon).  And  mingling  together %0a%3c an  infinite  Portion  of  the  superior  celestial  Nature  of  Air, %0a%3c with  very  much  of  earthly  Vapours,  it  doth  participate  con- %0a%3c fusedly of  both.  From  hence  proceed  Clouds,  Thunders, %0a%3c and  those  terrible  Lightnings.  From  hence  come  Hail, %0a%3c Frosts,  Rain,  Storms,  and  Whirlwinds :  from  hence  arise %0a%3c most  of  the  Calamities  of  mortal  Men,  and  the  continual %0a%3c War  that  Nature  maketh  with  herself.  For  these  gross %0a%3c Exhalations,  as  they  mount  upward  to  the  Heaven,  are %0a%3c beaten  back  by  the  Violence  of  the  Stars  :  and  the  same %0a%3c again  draw  up  to  them  those  Matters,  which  of  their  own %0a%3c Accord  ascend  not.  For  thus  we  see,  that  Showers  of  Rain %0a%3c fall,  Mists  arise,  Rivers  are  dried  up,  Hail-storms  came  down %0a%3c amain,  the  Sunbeams  scorch  the  ground,  and  drive  it  every %0a%3c where  to  the  midst :  but  the  same  again  unbroken,  and  not %0a%3c loosing  their  Force,  rebound  and  take  up  with  them  whatso- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 74  History  of  Nature.  [BoOK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c ever  they  are  able.  Vapours  fall  from  aloft,  and  return  again %0a%3c on  high:  forcible  Winds  come  empty,  but  return  with  a %0a%3c Booty.  So  many  living  Creatures  draw  their  Breath  from %0a%3c above :  but  the  same  laboureth  contrariwise,  and  the  Earth %0a%3c infuseth  into  the  Air  a  Spirit  as  if  it  were  empty.  Thus,  while %0a%3c Nature  goeth  to  and  fro,  as  forced  by  some  Engine,  by  the %0a%3c Swiftness  of  the  Heaven  the  Fire  of  Discord  is  kindled. %0a%3c Neither  can  she  stand  to  the  Fight,  but  being  continually %0a%3c carried  away  she  is  rolled  about,  and  as  she  spreadeth  about %0a%3c the  Earth,  with  an  immeasurable  Globe  of  the  Heaven,  so %0a%3c ever  and  anon  through  the  Clouds  she  frameth  another  Sky. %0a%3c And  this  is  that  Region  where  the  Winds  reign.  And  there- %0a%3c fore their  Kingdom  principally  is  there  where  they  execute %0a%3c their  Forces.  For  Thunderbolts  and  Lightnings  most  Men %0a%3c attribute  to  their  Violence.  Nay,  and  so  it  is  supposed  that %0a%3c sometimes  it  raineth  Stones,  which  may  be  taken  up  first  by %0a%3c the  Wind  ;  and  many  similar  Appearances.  Wherefore  many %0a%3c Matters  besides  are  to  be  treated  of  together. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XXXIX. %0a%3c Of  Ordinary  Sedsons. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  manifest  that  of  Seasons,  as  also  of  other  Things, %0a%3c some  Causes  be  certain  ;  others,  casual ;  or,  such  as  yet  the %0a%3c Reason  thereof  is  unknown.  For  who  doubteth  that  Sum- %0a%3c mers and  Winters,  and  those  alternative  Seasons  which  we %0a%3c observe  by  yearly  Course,  are  occasioned  by  the  Motion  of %0a%3c the  Planets?  As,  therefore,  the  Sun's  Nature  is  understood %0a%3c by  tempering  and  ordering  the  Year,  so  the  rest  of  the  Stars %0a%3c have  every  one  their  peculiar  Power,  and  the  same  effectual %0a%3c to  perform  their  own  Nature.  Some  are  fruitful  to  bring %0a%3c forth  Moisture,  that  is  turned  into  liquid  Rain  :  others  to %0a%3c yield  an  Humour  either  congealed  into  Frosts,  or  gathered %0a%3c and  thickened  into  Snow,  or  else  frozen  into  Hail  :  some %0a%3c afford  Winds ;  others  Warmth  :  some  hot  and  scorching %0a%3c Vapours ;  some,  Dews ;  and  others,  Cold.  Neither  ought %0a%3c these  Stars  to  be  esteemed  no  more  than  they  shew  in  Sight, %0a%3c seeing  that  none  of  them  is  less  than  the  Moon  ;  as  may %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  75 %0a%3c %0a%3c appear  by  the  Reason  of  their  exceeding  Height.  All  of %0a%3c them,  then,  every  one  in  its  own  Motion,  exercise  their %0a%3c several  Natures :  which  appeareth  manifestly  by  Saturn %0a%3c especially,  who  setteth  open  the  Gates  for  Rain  and  Showers %0a%3c to  pass.  And  not  only  the  seven  Wandering  Stars  possess %0a%3c this  Power,  but  many  of  them  also  that  are  fixed  in  the  Fir- %0a%3c mament ;  so  often  as  they  be  either  driven  by  the  Approach %0a%3c of  those  Planets,  or  provoked  by  the  Casting  and  Influence %0a%3c of  their  Beams  :  like  as  we  find  it  happeneth  in  the  seven %0a%3c Stars  called  Suculce,  which  the  Grecians,  of  Rain,  name %0a%3c Hyades  (because  they  ever  bring  foul  Weather).  Howbeit %0a%3c some  of  their  own  Nature,  and  at  certain  set  Times,  do  cause %0a%3c Rain ;  as  the  Rising  of  the  Kids.  The  Star  Arcturus  very %0a%3c rarely  appeareth  without  some  tempestuous  Hail1. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XL. %0a%3c The  Power  of  the  Dog- Star. %0a%3c %0a%3c WHO  knoweth  not,  that  when  the  Dog-Star  ariseth,  the %0a%3c Heat  of  the  Sun  is  fiery  and  burning?  the  effects  of  which %0a%3c Star  are  felt  exceeding  much  upon  the  Earth.  The  Seas  at %0a%3c his  Rising  do  rage,  the  Wines  in  Cellars  are  troubled,  stand- %0a%3c ing Waters  are  moved.  A  wild  Beast  there  is  in  Egypt, %0a%3c called  Orix~,  which  the  Egyptians  say,  doth  stand  full  against %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  It  is  scarcely  necessary  to  warn  the  modern  reader,  that  throughout %0a%3c these  observations  on  the  weather,  an  influence  is  ascribed  to  the  rising  of %0a%3c certain  stars,  from  no  better  cause  than  the  coincidence  of  the  occurrences. %0a%3c —Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  Pliny  mentions  this  animal  in  book  x.  c.  73 ;  and  again  in  book  xi. %0a%3c c.  46  ;  but  modern  naturalists  have  failed  to  identify  it  with  any  creature %0a%3c known  at  the  present  time.    Indeed,  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  more %0a%3c than  one  creature  has  been  thus  designated  by  the  ancients ;  for  it  has %0a%3c been  described  as  having  only  one  horn;  which  would  make  it  either %0a%3c a  species  of  rhinoceros,  or  the  animal  resembling  a  stag  or  horse,  so  often %0a%3c spoken  of  under  the  name  of  Unicorn.    It  has  also  been  compared  to  an %0a%3c ox ;  and  four  horns  have  been  ascribed  to  it.  But,  more  precisely,  it  is  said %0a%3c to  be  white,  with  horns  and  a  beard ;  which  renders  it  probable  that  it %0a%3c was  of  the  goat  kind.    As  the  religion  of  the  ancient  Heathens  was  merely %0a%3c ceremonial,  the  imputing  to  the  creature,  in  the  practice  of  sneezing,  an %0a%3c act  of  adoration  to  Anubis,  or  the  Dog- Star,  one  of  the  chief  deities  of  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 76  History  of  Nature.

As  for  Dogs,  no %0a%3c Man  doubteth  but  all  the  Time  of  the  canicular  Days  they %0a%3c are  most  ready  to  run  mad. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLI. %0a%3c %0a%3c That  the  Stars  have  their  several  Influences  in  sundry  Parts %0a%3c of  the  Signs,  and  at  divers  Times. %0a%3c %0a%3c MOREOVER1,  the  Parts  of  certain  Signs  have  their  peculiar %0a%3c Force,  as  appeareth  in  the  autumnal  Equinox,  and  in  Mid- %0a%3c Winter  ;  at  which  Time  we  perceive  that  the  Sun  maketh %0a%3c Tempests.  And  this  is  proved,  not  only  by  Rains  and  Storms, %0a%3c %0a%3c Egyptians,  will  appear  less  absurd  than  at  the  first  mention  would %0a%3c appear.  For  a  similar  reason  Pliny  ascribes  religion  to  elephants,  and %0a%3c even  poultry. %0a%3c %0a%3c In  his  28th  book,  the  Author  (ch.  2)  has  some  observations  on  the %0a%3c superstition  of  the  Romans,  relative  to  the  act  of  sneezing ;  and  it  is %0a%3c not  a  little  remarkable,  that  a  similar  practice,  of  imprecating  a  bless- %0a%3c ing in  such  case,  is  not  even  now  uncommon  among  ourselves. —  Wern. %0a%3c Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  In  this  chapter  there  is  a  confusion  of  cause  and  effect  that  is  diffi- %0a%3c cult to  unravel ;  and  which  can  only  be  accounted  for  by  involving  what %0a%3c are  undoubtedly  natural  influences  —  in  modern  times  easily  explained  — %0a%3c with  occult  causes,  the  bounds  of  which  the  ancients  were  not  able  to %0a%3c define.  The  influence  of  the  sun's  heat  on  currents  of  air,  constituting %0a%3c winds  and  tempests,  and  even  its  simple  action  on  the  texture  of  a %0a%3c membrane,  are  thus  confounded  with  the  powers  which  the  Signs  of %0a%3c the  Zodiac  were  supposed  to  exert  on  the  functions  of  the  organs  or  re- %0a%3c gions of  the  human  body.  According  to  this  philosopy,  each  of  the %0a%3c twelve  signs  exerted  a  peculiar  influence  on  a  distinct  portion  ;  beginning %0a%3c with  the  head,  which  was  governed  by  Aries;  and  proceeding  downward %0a%3c by  regular  spaces,  each  opposite  sign  in  the  Annual  Circle  became  the %0a%3c monarch  of  its  season,  until  the  Twins,  opposite  to  Aries,  displayed  their %0a%3c power  over  the  feet.  To  the  reproach  of  modern  science,  these  imaginary %0a%3c influences,  which  derived  their  origin  in  popular  opinion,  from  a  supposed %0a%3c sympathetic  connexion  of  the  spirit  pervading  these  signs  —  a  portion  of %0a%3c the  great  soul  of  the  world  (Note  to  ch.  1),  and  therefore  a  portion  of %0a%3c a  very  ancient  idolatry — maintains  its  place  in  the  popular  almanacs, %0a%3c published  under  the  superintendence  of  a  public  company  especially %0a%3c instituted  for  the  promotion  of  an  improved  literature. —  Wern.

It  is  cer- %0a%3c tain also,  that  the  Bodies  of  Oysters,  Mussels,  Cockles,  and %0a%3c all  Shell-fishes,  grow  and  waste  by  the  Power  of  the  Moon ; %0a%3c and  some  have  found  out  by  diligent  Search,  that  the  Fibres %0a%3c in  the  Livers  of  Rats  and  Mice  answer  in  Number  to  the %0a%3c Days  of  the  Moon's  Age  :  also  that  the  very  little  Creature, %0a%3c the  Emmet,  feeleth  the  Power  of  this  Planet,  and  always  in %0a%3c the  Change  of  the  Moon  ceaseth  from  Work.  It  is  the  more %0a%3c Shame  to  Man  to  be  ignorant,  especially  seeing  that  he  must %0a%3c confess,  that  some  labouring  Beasts  have  certain  Diseases  in %0a%3c their  Eyes,  which  with  the  Moon  do  grow  and  decay.

Also,  that  Clouds  are  produced  by %0a%3c Vapours  which  are  gone  up  on  high,  or  else  of  the  Air %0a%3c gathered  into  a  watery  Liquor :  that  they  be  thick,  and  of  a %0a%3c bodily  Consistence,  we  collect  by  no  doubtful  Argument, %0a%3c considering  that  they  overshadow  the  Sun,  which  otherwise %0a%3c may  be  seen  through  Water;  as  they  know  well  that  dive  to %0a%3c any  good  Depth, %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIII. %0a%3c Of  Thunder  and  Lightning.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c I  WOULD  not  deny,  therefore,  that  the  fiery  Impressions %0a%3c from  Stars  above,  may  fall  upon  these  Clouds,  such  as  we %0a%3c oftentimes  see  to  shoot  in  clear  and  fair  Weather :  by  the %0a%3c forcible  Stroke  whereof,  good  Reason  it  is.  that  the  Air %0a%3c should  be  mightily  shaken,  seeing  that  Darts  when  they  are %0a%3c discharged,  make  a  Noise  as  they  fly.  But  when  they  en- %0a%3c counter a  Cloud,  there  ariseth  a  Vapour  with  a  dissonant %0a%3c Sound  (as  when  a  red-hot  Iron  maketh  an  Hissing  when %0a%3c thrust  into  Water),  and  Smoke  rolls  up  in  Waves.  Hence %0a%3c Storms  are  bred.  And  if  this  Flatus,  or  Vapour,  do  struggle %0a%3c within  the  Cloud,  Thunder  is  given  out ;  if  it  break  through %0a%3c still  burning,  then  flieth  out  the  Thunderbolt :  if  it  be  a %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  An  attempt  to  explain  the  cause  of  thunder  and  lightning  could %0a%3c scarcely  be  otherwise  than  futile,  in  the  entire  absence  of  a  knowledge  of %0a%3c the  existence  of  such  a  matter  as  electricity.  But  any  attempt  at  a  natural %0a%3c explanation  was  an  effort  of  courage,  and  far  in  advance  of  the  popular %0a%3c opinion.  On  this  account  the  Author  is  entitled  to  pardon,  when,  at  the %0a%3c conclusion  of  the  chapter  he  finds  himself  disposed  to  make  some  conces- %0a%3c sion, in  admitting  it  to  be  possible,  that  some  of  these  phenomena  were %0a%3c premonitory,  and  direct  from  the  gods. —  Wern.

It  is  possible, %0a%3c also,  that  the  Wind,  elevated  from  the  Earth,  being  repelled, %0a%3c and  kept  down  by  the  Stars,  and  so  restrained  within  a %0a%3c Cloud,  may  thunder,  while  Nature  choketh  the  rumbling %0a%3c Sound  all  the  while  it  striveth ;  but  sendeth  forth  a  Crash %0a%3c when  it  breaketh  out,  as  we  see  in  a  Bladder  puffed  up  with %0a%3c Wind.  Likewise  it  may  be,  that  the  same  Wind  or  Spirit  is %0a%3c set  on  Fire  by  Attrition,  as  it  violently  passeth  headlong %0a%3c down.  It  may  also  be  stricken  by  the  Conflict  of  the  Clouds, %0a%3c as  if  two  Stones  hit  one  against  another ;  and  so  the  Flashes %0a%3c sparkle  forth.  But  all  these  are  Accidents.  And  from  hence %0a%3c come  those  insignificant  and  vain  Lightnings,  which  have  no %0a%3c natural  Cause.  With  these  are  Mountains  and  Seas  smitten  : %0a%3c and  of  this  Kind  be  all  other  Explosions  that  do  no  Hurt  to %0a%3c living  Creatures.  Those  that  come  from  above,  and  of  fixed %0a%3c Causes,  yea,  and  from  their  proper  Stars,  foretel  future %0a%3c Events.  In  like  Manner,  it  may  be  that  the  Winds,  or  rather %0a%3c Blasts,  proceed  from  a  dry  Exhalation  of  the  Earth,  void  of %0a%3c all  Moisture  :  neither  will  I  deny  that  they  arise  from  Waters %0a%3c breathing  out  an  Air,  which  neither  can  thicken  into  a  Mist, %0a%3c nor  gather  into  Clouds :  also  they  may  be  driven  by  the %0a%3c Impulsion  of  the  Sun,  because  the  Wind  is  conceived  to  be %0a%3c Nothing  else  but  the  flowing  of  the  Air,  and  that  by  many %0a%3c means.  For  some  we  see  to  rise  out  of  Rivers,  Snows,  and %0a%3c Seas,  even  when  they  be  still  and  calm  :  as  also  others  out  of %0a%3c the  Earth,  which  Winds  they  name  Altani.  And  those  verily %0a%3c when  they  come  back  again  from  the  Sea,  are  called  Tropcei: %0a%3c if  they  go  onward,  Apogcei. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLIV. %0a%3c What  is  the  Reason  of  the  Resounding  of  the  Echo. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  the  Windings  of  Hills,  and  their  close  Turnings, %0a%3c their  many  Tops,  their  Ridges  also  bending  like  an  Elbow, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80  History  of  Nature.

The  Place's  Name  is  Senta.  Moreover,  in %0a%3c the  Province  Cyrenaica  there  is  reported  to  be  a  Rock  con- %0a%3c secrated to  the  South-wind,  which  without  Profanation  may %0a%3c not  be  touched  with  Man's  Hand  ;  but  if  it  be,  presently  the %0a%3c South-wind  doth  arise  and  cast  up  Heaps  of  Sand.  Also  in %0a%3c many  Houses  there  be  hollow  Places  devised  by  Man's  Hand %0a%3c for  the  Receipt  of  Wind  ;  which  being  enclosed  with  Shade, %0a%3c gather  their  Blasts.  Whereby  we  may  see  how  all  Winds %0a%3c have  a  Cause.  But  great  Difference  there  is  between  such %0a%3c Blasts  and  Winds.  As  for  these,  they  be  settled,  and  conti- %0a%3c nually blowing ;  which,  not  some  particular  Places,  but %0a%3c whole  Lands  do  feel ;  which  are  not  light  Gales  nor  stormy %0a%3c Puffs  of  the  Sea,  named  Aurce  and  Procellce,  but  properly %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  there  is  an  intimate  connexion  between  the  interior  of  the %0a%3c earth  and  the  atmosphere,  operating  in  the  production  or  direction  of  the %0a%3c nature  or  force  of  winds,  is  exceedingly  probable ;  although  the  particular %0a%3c instances  here  given  are  either  imaginary,  or  strangely  misinterpreted. %0a%3c A  simple  change  in  the  pressure  of  the  atmosphere  —  a  meteorological %0a%3c phenomenon  of  which  the  ancients  were  ignorant,  from  not  being  aware %0a%3c that  air  possessed  positive  weight  —  will  account  for  many  of  these  sudden %0a%3c gusts  from  caverns ;  and  for  those  hollow  murmurs  that  have  been  popu- %0a%3c larly remarked  in  hilly  countries,  before  the  approach  of  a  storm ;  and %0a%3c the  utility  of  these  outbursts  will  appear  when  we  remember,  that  with- %0a%3c out them,  poisonous  exhalations,  as  marsh  miasmata,  and  carbonic  acid %0a%3c gas,  would  be  suffered  to  accumulate,  to  the  destruction  of  a  neighbour- %0a%3c hood.— Wern.

I  marvel  so  much %0a%3c the  more,  that  the  World  being  so  at  Discord,  and  divided %0a%3c into  Kingdoms,  that  is  to  say,  dismembered  ;  so  many  Men %0a%3c have  employed  their  Care  to  seek  after  these  Things,  so  diffi- %0a%3c cult to  be  found  out ;  and  the  more  especially  in  Time  of %0a%3c Wars,  and  amid  those  Places  where  was  no  safe  Abode ;  and %0a%3c especially  when  Pirates,  those  common  Enemies  to  Mankind, %0a%3c held  well  near  all  Passages  of  Communication  :  I  marvel, %0a%3c also,  that  at  this  Day  each  Man  in  his  own  Tract  of  Country %0a%3c obtaineth  more  Knowledge  of  some  Things  by  their  Com- %0a%3c mentaries, who  never  set  Foot  there,  than  he  doth  by  the %0a%3c Skill  and  Information  of  home-born  Inhabitants  ;  whereas %0a%3c now  in  Time  of  such  blessed  and  joyous  Peace,  and  under  a %0a%3c Prince  who  taketh  such  Delight  in  the  Progress  of  the  State %0a%3c and  of  all  good  Arts,  no  new  Thing  is  learned  by  farther %0a%3c Inquisition  ;  nay,  nor  so  much  as  the  Inventions  of  old  Wri- %0a%3c ters are  thoroughly  understood.  And  verily  it  cannot  be %0a%3c said,  that  greater  Rewards  were  in  those  Days  given,  consi- %0a%3c dering that  the  Bounty  of  Fortune  was  dispersed  :  and  in %0a%3c truth,  most  of  these  learned  Men  sought  out  these  Secrets %0a%3c for  no  other  Regard  than  to  do  good  to  Posterity.  But %0a%3c now  Men's  Customs  are  waxed  old  and  decay  :  and  notwith- %0a%3c %0a%3c F %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c standing  that  the  Fruit  of  Learning  be  as  great  as  ever  it %0a%3c was,  yet  Men  are  become  idle  in  this  behalf.  The  Seas  are %0a%3c open  to  all,  an  infinite  Multitude  of  Sailors  have  discovered %0a%3c all  Coasts  whatsoever ;  they  sail  through  and  arrive  fami- %0a%3c liarly at  every  Shore  ;  but  all  is  for  Gain,  nothing  for  the %0a%3c Sake  of  Knowledge.  Their  Minds  altogether  blinded,  and %0a%3c bent  upon  nothing  but  Covetousness,  never  consider  that  the %0a%3c same  might  with  more  Safety  be  performed  by  Science.  And %0a%3c therefore,  seeing  there  be  so  many  thousand  Sailors  that %0a%3c hazard  themselves  on  the  Seas,  I  will  treat  of  the  Winds  more %0a%3c curiously  than,  perhaps,  would  otherwise  be  necessary  to  the %0a%3c present  Work. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLVII. %0a%3c Many  Sorts  of  Winds. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Ancients  observed  four  Winds1  only,  according %0a%3c to  so  many  Quarters  of  the  World  (and  therefore  Homer %0a%3c nameth  no  more)  :  a  feeble  Reason  this,  as  soon  after  it  was %0a%3c judged.  The  Age  ensuing  added  eight  more,  and  they  were %0a%3c on  the  other  Side  in  their  Conceit,  too  subtle  and  concise. %0a%3c The  modern  Sailors  have  found  a  Mean  between  both :  and %0a%3c they  put  unto  that  short  Number  of  the  first,  four  Winds %0a%3c and  no  more  ;  which  they  took  out  of  the  latter.  Therefore %0a%3c every  Quarter  of  the  Heaven  hath  two  Winds  to  itself. %0a%3c From  the  equinoctial  Sun-rising  bloweth  the  East  Wind,  Sub- %0a%3c solanus:  from  the  Rising  thereof  in  Midwinter  the  South-east, %0a%3c Vulturnus.  The  former  of  these  two  the  Greeks  call  Apeliotes, %0a%3c and  the  latter  Eurus.  From  the  Midday  riseth  the  South %0a%3c Wind :  and  from  the  Sun-setting  in  Midwinter  the  South-west, %0a%3c Africus.  They  also  name  these  two,  Notus  and  Libs.  From %0a%3c the  equinoctial  going  down  of  the  Sun,  the  West  Wind, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  impression  of  this  precise  number  of  winds  appears  to  have  been %0a%3c popular ;  and  is  referred  to  in  the  Book  of  Revelation  by  St.  John,  vii.  1 : %0a%3c "  I  saw  four  angels  standing  on  the  four  corners  of  the  earth,  holding  the %0a%3c four  winds  of  the  earth."  Pliny  evidently  supposes  that  the  winds  were %0a%3c not  simply  determined  according  to  the  quarter  from  which  they  blew, %0a%3c but  by  separate  and  inherent  qualities  of  heat,  moisture,  violence,  health, %0a%3c or  sickness. — Wern.

From  the  North  bloweth  the  North  Wind,  Sep- %0a%3c tentrio:  between  which  and  the  Sunrising  in  Summer  is  the %0a%3c North-east  Wind,  Aquilo,  named  Aparctias  and  Boreas  by  the %0a%3c Greeks.  A  greater  Reckoning  than  this  for  Number  is %0a%3c brought  in  by  some,  who  have  thrust  in  four  more  between : %0a%3c namely,  Thracias  between  the  North  and  the  Summer  Setting %0a%3c of  the  Sun  ;  in  like  Manner  Ccecias,  in  the  midst  between  the %0a%3c North-east,  Aquilo,  and  that  of  the  Sunrising  in  the  equi- %0a%3c noctial, Sub-solanus.  Also,  after  the  Sunrising  in  Summer, %0a%3c Phceniceas  in  the  midst,  between  the  South-east  and  the  South. %0a%3c Last  of  all,  between  the  South  and  the  South-west,  Lybo- %0a%3c notus,  just  in  the  midst,  compounded  of  them  both,  namely, %0a%3c between  the  Meridian  and  the  Sun-setting  in  Winter.  But %0a%3c here  they  did  not  end.  For  others  have  set  one  more,  called %0a%3c Mese,  between  the  North-east  Wind  Boreas  and  Ccecias:  also %0a%3c JSuronotuSj  between  the  South  and  South-west  Winds.  Besides %0a%3c all  these,  there  be  some  Winds  peculiar  to  every  Nation, %0a%3c and  which  pass  not  beyond  one  certain  Region  :  as,  namely, %0a%3c Scyros  among  the  Athenians,  declining  a  little  from  Argestes; %0a%3c a  Wind  unknown  to  other  Parts  of  Greece.  In  some  other %0a%3c Place  it  is  more  aloft,  and  the  same  then  is  called  Olympias %0a%3c (as  coming  from  the  Mountain  Olympus).  But  the  usual %0a%3c Manner  of  Speech  understandeth  by  all  these  Names  Ar- %0a%3c gestes only.  Some  call  Ccecias  by  the  Name  of  Hellespontias, %0a%3c and  give  the  same  Winds  in  sundry  Places  divers  Names. %0a%3c In  the  Province,  likewise,  of  Narbonne,  the  most  notorious %0a%3c Wind  is  Circius,  and  for  violence  inferior  to  none,  driving %0a%3c directly  before  it,  very  often,  the  Current  at  Ostia  into  the %0a%3c Ligurian  Sea.  The  same  Wind  is  not  only  unknown  in  all %0a%3c other  Parts  of  the  Heaven,  but  reacheth  not  so  much  as  to %0a%3c Vienna,  a  City  in  the  same  Province.  As  great  and  bois- %0a%3c terous a  Wind  as  this  is  otherwise,  yet  it  meets  with  a  Re- %0a%3c straint before  it  come  thither,  and  is  kept  within  narrow %0a%3c Bounds  by  the  Opposition  of  a  small  Hill.  Fabianus  also %0a%3c avoucheth,  that  the  South  Winds  enter  not  so  far  as  into %0a%3c Egypt.  Whereby  the  Law  of  Nature  sheweth  itself  plainly, %0a%3c that  even  Winds  have  their  Times  and  Limits  appointed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c To  proceed,  then,  the  Spring  openeth  the  Sea  for  Sailors: %0a%3c in  the  Beginning  whereof,  the  West  Winds  mitigate  the  Win- %0a%3c ter Weather  at  the  Time  when  the  Sun  is  in  the  25th  Degree %0a%3c of  Aquarius,  and  that  is  the  sixth  Day  before  the  Ides  of %0a%3c February.  And  this  Order  holdeth  for  the  most  Part  with %0a%3c all  other  Winds,  which  I  will  set  down  one  after  another :  so %0a%3c that  in  every  Leap  Year  we  anticipate  and  reckon  one  Day %0a%3c sooner,  and  then  again  keep  the  same  Rule  throughout  all %0a%3c the  four  Years  following.  Some  call  Favonius  (which  begin- %0a%3c neth  to  blow  about  the  seventh  Day  before  the  Calends  of %0a%3c March)  by  the  Name  of  Chelidonius,  upon  the  Sight  of  the %0a%3c first  Swallows1:  but  many  name  it  Orinthias,  coming  the %0a%3c seventy-first  Day  after  the  shortest  Day  in  Winter ;  by  occa- %0a%3c sion of  the  coming  of  Birds :  which  Wind  bloweth  for  nine %0a%3c Days.  Opposite  to  Favonius  is  the  Wind  which  we  called %0a%3c Sub-solanus.  Unto  this  Wind  is  attributed  the  Rising  of  the %0a%3c Vergilice,  or  Seven  Stars,  in  as  many  Degrees  of  Taurus,  six %0a%3c Days  before  the  Ides  of  May ;  which  Time  is  a  southerly %0a%3c Constitution  :  and  to  this  Wind  the  North  is  contrary. %0a%3c Moreover,  in  the  hottest  Season  of  the  Summer  the  Dog-star %0a%3c ariseth,  when  the  Sun  entereth  into  the  first  Degree  of  Leo, %0a%3c which  commonly  is  the  fifteenth  Day  before  the  Calends  of %0a%3c August.  Before  the  Rising  of  this  Star  for  eight  Days' %0a%3c Space,  or  thereabout,  the  North-east  Winds  blow ;  which  the %0a%3c Greeks  call  Prodromi,  or  Forerunners.  And  two  Days  after %0a%3c it  is  risen,  the  same  Winds  hold  still  more  stiffly  for  the %0a%3c Space  of  forty  Days,  which  they  name  Etesia.  The  Sun's %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Ovid  ("  Fasti ")  says,  on  the  day  which  is  equivalent  to  about  the %0a%3c 25th  of  February:— %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Fallimur  ?  an  veris  praenuntia  venit  hirundo  ? %0a%3c Et  metuit,  nequa  versa  recurrat  hyems  ?  " %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Am  I  deceived  ?  is  that  the  swallow's  wing  ? %0a%3c That  flits  along,  the  herald  of  the  spring. %0a%3c Fearful  of  cold,  she  still  seeks  shelter  here  ; %0a%3c And  dreads  that  winter  may  reclaim  the  year." %0a%3c %0a%3c In  Sardinia  it  is  noted  on  the  last  day  of  the  same  month,  in  the  "  Calendar %0a%3c of  the  Transactions  of  the  Royal  Academy  of  Brussels."  But  these  are %0a%3c early  appearances ;  and  in  general  this  bird  arrives  in  Italy  in  the  first %0a%3c ten  days  of  March.—  Wern.

Next  after  them  come  the  South  Winds %0a%3c again,  which  are  usually  up,  until  the  Star  Arcturus  riseth, %0a%3c and  that  is  eleven  Days  before  the  autumnal  Equinox.  With %0a%3c it  entereth  Corns,  and  thus  Corns  beginneth  the  Autumn  ; %0a%3c and  to  this  Vulturnus  is  contrary.  After  that  Equinox  about %0a%3c four-and-forty  Days,  the  Vergilice  go  down  and  begin  Win- %0a%3c ter, which  Season  usually  falleth  upon  the  third  Day  before %0a%3c the  Ides  of  November.  This  is  the  Winter  North-east  Wind, %0a%3c which  is  far  unlike  to  that  in  Summer,  opposite  and  contrary %0a%3c to  Africus.  Seven  Days  before  the  Midwinter  Day,  and  as %0a%3c much  after,  the  Sea  is  allayed  and  calm  for  the  Sitting  and %0a%3c Hatching  of  the  Birds  Halciones1,  from  which  these  Days %0a%3c took  the  Name  Alcionis:  the  Time  behind  belongs  to  Winter. %0a%3c And  yet  these  boisterous  Seasons,  full  of  Tempests,  shut  not %0a%3c up  the  Sea :  for  Pirates  at  first  forced  Men,  with  Peril  of %0a%3c Death,  to  run  headlong  upon  their  Death,  and  to  hazard %0a%3c themselves  in  Winter  Seas ;  and  now  Covetousness  compels %0a%3c them  to  do  the  like. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  coldest  Winds  of  all  other  are  those  which,  we  said, %0a%3c blow  from  the  North,  and  together  with  them  their  Neigh- %0a%3c bour, Corns.  These  Winds  allay  all  others,  and  drive  away %0a%3c Clouds.  Moist  Winds  are  Africus,  and  especially  the  South %0a%3c Wind  of  Italy,  called  Auster.  Men  report  also,  that  Ccecias %0a%3c in  Pontus  gathereth  to  itself  Clouds.  Corns  and  Vulturnus %0a%3c are  dry,  but  only  when  they  cease.  The  North-east  and  the %0a%3c North  produce  Snow.  The  North  Wind  also  bringeth  Hail, %0a%3c as  doth  Corns.  The  South  Wind  is  exceeding  hot.  Vulturnus %0a%3c and  Favonius  be  warm.  They  also  be  drier  than  the  East : %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Ovid  relates  the  fable  of  the  origin  of  the  Halcyon,  or  Alcyon, %0a%3c "  Metamorphoses,"  book  xi.  fable  10;  and  Pliny  describes  the  bird  in  his %0a%3c book  x.  c.  32.  2Elian  also  speaks  of  it,  book  i.  c.  36  ;  and  he  describes  the %0a%3c wonders  of  the  nest,  b.  ix.  c.  17,  in  a  manner  which  the  ancients  gene- %0a%3c rally appear  to  have  regarded  as  substantially  true;  but  it  is  scarcely %0a%3c necessary  to  remark,  that  modern  observation  has  not  corroborated  this %0a%3c belief  in  any  particular.  In  book  xxxii.  c.  8,  Pliny  speaks  of  a  medicine %0a%3c which  was  supposed  to  be  prepared  from  the  nest  of  the  Alcyon,  or  King- %0a%3c fisher.— Wern.

Of  all  Winds  the  Northern %0a%3c is  most  healthful :  the  Southern  Wind  is  noisome,  and  the %0a%3c rather  when  it  is  dry ;  haply,  because  that  when  it  is  moist %0a%3c it  is  the  colder.  During  the  Time  that  it  bloweth,  living- %0a%3c Creatures  are  thought  to  be  less  hungry.  The  Etesice  give %0a%3c over  ordinarily  in  the  Night,  and  arise  at  the  third  hour  of %0a%3c the  Day.  In  Spain  and  Asia  they  blow  from  the  East :  but %0a%3c in  Pontus,  from  the  North  :  in  other  Quarters,  from  the %0a%3c South.  They  blow  also  after  the  Midwinter,  when  they  be %0a%3c called  OrinthicB ;  but  those  are  more  mild,  and  continue %0a%3c fewer  Days.  Two  there  be  that  change  their  Nature  with %0a%3c their  Place  :  the  South  Wind  in  Africa  bringeth  fair  Weather, %0a%3c and  the  North  Wind  there  is  cloudy.  All  Winds  keep  their %0a%3c Course  in  Order  for  the  more  Part,  or  else  when  one  ceaseth %0a%3c the  contrary  beginneth.  When  some  are  laid  and  the  next %0a%3c to  them  arise,  they  go  about  from  the  left  Hand  to  the  right, %0a%3c according  to  the  Sun.  Of  their  Manner  and  Order  monthly, %0a%3c the  fourth  Day  after  the  Change  of  the  Moon  doth  most %0a%3c commonly  determine.  The  same  Winds  will  serve  to  sail %0a%3c contrary  Ways,  by  means  of  setting  out  the  Sails  :  so  as  many %0a%3c Times  in  the  Night,  Ships  in  sailing  run  one  against  another. %0a%3c The  South  Wind  raiseth  greater  Billows  than  the  North :  for %0a%3c that  the  South  Wind  ariseth  below,  from  the  Bottom  of  the %0a%3c Sea ;  the  other  descends  from  on  high.  And,  therefore,  after %0a%3c Southern  Winds,  Earthquakes  are  most  hurtful.  The  South %0a%3c Wind  in  the  Night  Time  is  more  boisterous,  the  Northern %0a%3c Wind  in  the  Day.  The  Winds  blowing  from  the  East  con- %0a%3c tinue longer  than  those  from  the  West.  The  Northern  Winds %0a%3c give  over  commonly  with  an  odd  Number :  which  Observa- %0a%3c tion serveth  to  good  use  in  many  other  Parts  of  natural %0a%3c Things,  and  therefore  the  male  Winds  are  judged  by  the  odd %0a%3c Number.  The  Sun  both  raiseth  and  also  allayeth  the  Winds. %0a%3c At  rising  and  setting  he  causeth  them  to  blow :  at  Noontide %0a%3c he  represseth  them  in  Summer.  And  therefore  at  Mid-day %0a%3c or  Midnight  commonly  the  Winds  are  allayed  ;  for  both  Cold %0a%3c and  Heat,  if  they  be  immoderate,  do  consume  them.  Also, %0a%3c Rain  doth  lay  the  Winds  :  and  most  commonly  from  thence %0a%3c they  are  looked  for  to  blow,  where  Clouds  break  and  lay %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  87 %0a%3c %0a%3c open  the  Sky.

And  always  the  Lustrum1  or  Com- %0a%3c putation of  the  five  Years,  beginneth  at  the  Leap  Year,  when %0a%3c the  Dog-star  doth  arise.  And  thus  much  concerning  general %0a%3c Winds. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  XLVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Sudden  Blasts. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now  will  we  speak  of  sudden  Blasts :  which  being  raised %0a%3c (as  hath  been  said  before)  by  Exhalations  of  the  Earth,  and %0a%3c cast  down  again,  in  the  meanwhile  appear  of  many  Fashions, %0a%3c enclosed  within  a  thin  Course  of  Clouds.  For  such  as  be  wan- %0a%3c dering and  rushing  in  Manner  of  Land-floods  (as  some  Men %0a%3c were  of  opinion,  as  we  have  shewed),  bring  forth  Thunder %0a%3c and  Lightning.  But  if  they  come  with  a  greater  Force  and %0a%3c Violence,  and  cleave  a  dry  Cloud  asunder,  they  breed  a %0a%3c Storm,  which  of  the  Greeks  is  called  Ecnephias:  but  if  the %0a%3c Breach  be  not  great,  so  that  the  Wind  be  constrained  to  re- %0a%3c volve in  his  Descent  without  Fire,  that  is  to  say,  Lightning, %0a%3c it  makes  a  Whirlwind  called  Typhon,  that  is  to  say,  the %0a%3c vibrated  Ecnephias.  This  snatches  with  it  a  Piece  broken %0a%3c out  of  a  congealed  cold  Cloud,  turning  and  rolling  it  round, %0a%3c and  with  that  Weight  inaketh  its  own  Fall  more  heavy,  and %0a%3c changeth  from  Place  to  Place  with  a  vehement  Whirling. %0a%3c It  is  the  greatest  Danger  that  Sailors  have,  breaking  not %0a%3c only  their  Yards,  but  also  wrecking  the  very  Ships  to  twisted %0a%3c Fragments  :  and  yet  a  small  Matter  is  the  Remedy  for  it, %0a%3c namely,  the  casting  of  Vinegar  out  against  it  as  it  cometh  ; %0a%3c which  is  of  very  cold  Nature.  The  same  Storm  beating  upon %0a%3c a  Thing  is  itself  smitten  back  again  with  Violence,  and %0a%3c snatcheth  up  whatever  it  meeteth  in  the  Way  aloft  into  the %0a%3c Sky,  carrying  it  back,  and  swallowing  it  up  on  high.  But  if %0a%3c it  break  out  from  a  greater  Hole  of  the  said  Cloud,  by  it  so %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  space  of  time  came  round  at  the  beginning  of  every  fifth  year ; %0a%3c at  which  period,  originally,  the  census  was  taken,  and  the  taxes  fixed %0a%3c until  the  recurrence  of  the  same  period.—  Wern.

If  this  tem- %0a%3c pestuous Wind  when  it  broke  the  Cloud,  burned  fiercely, %0a%3c having  Fire  of  its  own  before,  and  catched  it  not  afterward, %0a%3c it  is  true  Lightning;  and  diifereth  from  Prester  only  as  Flame %0a%3c from  a  Coal  of  Fire.  Again,  Prester  spreadeth  widely  with  a %0a%3c Flash  ;  the  other  gathereth  into  a  Globe  with  Violence.  Vor- %0a%3c tex differeth  from  Turben  in  flying  back  :  and  as  much  as  a %0a%3c Crash  from  a  Crack.  The  Storm  Procella  differs  from  them %0a%3c both  in  Breadth,  and  rather  scattereth  than  breaketh  the %0a%3c Cloud.  There  riseth  also  a  dark  Mist,  resembling  a  mon- %0a%3c strous Beast ;  and  this  is  ever  a  terrible  Cloud  to  Sailors. %0a%3c Another,  likewise,  is  called  a  Pillar1,  when  the  Humour  is  so %0a%3c thick  and  congealed  that  it  standeth  compact  of  itself.  Of %0a%3c the  same  Sort  also  is  that  Cloud  which  draweth  Water  to  it, %0a%3c as  it  were,  into  a  long  Pipe. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  L. %0a%3c In  what  Lands  Lightnings  fall  not. %0a%3c %0a%3c IK  Winter  and  Summer  seldom  are  there  any  Lightnings, %0a%3c because  of  contrary  Causes :  for  in  Winter  the  Air  is  con- %0a%3c densed, and  thickened  with  a  deeper  Course  of  Clouds :  and  all %0a%3c the  Exhalations  from  the  Earth  being  chilled  and  frozen  hard, %0a%3c extinguish  what  fiery  Vapour  soever  otherwise  they  receive  : %0a%3c which  is  the  Reason  that  Scythia,  and  other  frozen  Countries %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Author  clearly  means  what,  in  modern  times,  is  denominated  a %0a%3c Water-spout :  a  phenomenon  not  uncommon  in  the  Mediterranean  Sea, %0a%3c and  in  other  warm  climates ;  but  exceedingly  rare,  if  at  all  occurring,  in %0a%3c northern  regions.  —  Wern.

And  Egypt1,  likewise, %0a%3c from  a  contrary  Cause,  is  exempt  from  Lightnings,  the  Rea- %0a%3c son being  its  excessive  Heat :  for  the  hot  and  dry  Exhalations %0a%3c of  the  Earth  gather  into  very  slender,  thin,  and  weak  Clouds. %0a%3c But  in  the  Spring  and  Autumn,  Lightnings  are  more  rife ; %0a%3c because  in  both  those  Seasons  the  Causes  as  well  of  Summer %0a%3c as  Winter  are  corrupt.  And  this  is  the  Reason  that  Light- %0a%3c nings are  common  in  Italy ;  for  the  Air  being  more  mov- %0a%3c able, by  Reason  of  a  milder  Winter  and  a  cloudy  Summer,  is %0a%3c always  of  the  Temperature  of  Spring  or  Autumn.  In  those %0a%3c Parts,  also,  of  Italy,  which  lie  off  from  the  North,  and  in- %0a%3c cline to  Warmth  (as,  namely,  in  the  Tract  about  Rome  and %0a%3c Campania),  there  is  Lightning  in  Winter  and  Summer  alike, %0a%3c which  happeneth  in  no  other  Part  thereof. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LI. %0a%3c Sundry  Sorts  of  Lightnings,  and  Wonders  thereof. %0a%3c %0a%3c VERY  many  Kinds  of  Lightning  are  set  down  by  Authors. %0a%3c Those  that  come  dry  burn  not,  but  only  disperse.  They  that %0a%3c come  moist  do  not  burn,  but  blast  and  embrown.  A  third %0a%3c Kind  there  is,  which  they  call  Bright  and  Clear;  and  that  is %0a%3c of  a  wonderful  Nature,  whereby  Tuns  are  drawn  dry,  and %0a%3c their  Sides,  Hoops,  and  Heads  never  touched,  nor  any  other %0a%3c Token  thereof  is  left  behind.

But  though %0a%3c very  rare,  thunder  and  lightning  are  not  unknown  in  Egypt,  at  least %0a%3c in  modern  times.     Thevenot  mentions  a  man  who  was  killed  by  light- %0a%3c ning at  Cairo,  when  he  was  there ;  —  but  such  a  circumstance  had  never %0a%3c been  known  before.

Martia,  a  noble %0a%3c Lady  of  Rome,  being  great  with  Child,  was  struck  with %0a%3c Lightning :  the  Child  she  went  with  was  killed  within  her, %0a%3c and  she  survived  without  any  Harm.  Among  the  Catiline %0a%3c Prodigies  it  is  found  upon  Record,  that  M.  Herennius  (a %0a%3c Counsellor  of  the  incorporate  Town  Pompeianum)  was  in  a %0a%3c fair  and  clear  Day  smitten  with  Lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LII. %0a%3c Of  Observations  touching  Lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  is  held  in  the  Writings  of  the  ancient  Tuscans1,  that %0a%3c there  be  nine  Gods  that  send  forth  Lightnings,  and  those %0a%3c of  eleven  Sorts  :  for  Jupiter  (say  they)  casteth  three  at  once. %0a%3c The  Romans  have  observed  two  of  them,  and  no  more;  attri- %0a%3c buting those  in  the  Day-time  to  Jupiter,  and  those  of  the %0a%3c Night  to  Summanus  or  Pluto.  And  these  verily  be  more %0a%3c rare,  for  the  Cause  before-named ;  namely,  the  Coldness %0a%3c of  the  Air  above.  In  Etruria,  they  suppose  that  some %0a%3c Lightnings  break  out  of  the  Earth,  which  they  call  Infera, %0a%3c or  Infernal ;  and  such  be  made  in  Midwinter.  And  these %0a%3c they  take  to  be  earthly,  and  of  all  most  mischievous  and  exe- %0a%3c crable :  neither  be  those  general  and  universal  Lightnings, %0a%3c nor  proceeding  from  the  Stars,  but  from  a  very  near  and %0a%3c more  troubled  Cause.  And  this  is  an  evident  Argument %0a%3c for  Distinction,  that  all  such  as  fall  from  the  upper  Sky  strike %0a%3c obliquely :  but  those  which  they  call  earthly,  smite  straight. %0a%3c But  the  Reason  why  these  are  thought  to  issue  from  the %0a%3c Earth  is,  because  they  fall  from  out  of  a  Matter  nearer  to %0a%3c the  Earth ;  forasmuch  as  they  leave  no  Marks  of  a  Stroke %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  people  was  famed  for  the  study  of  prognostications  from  natural %0a%3c appearances :  an  art  they  had  probably  derived  from  Egypt  or  Assyria, %0a%3c and  which  the  neighbouring  nations  learned  from  them.  It  consisted  in %0a%3c minutely  observing  every  unusual  occurrence,  and  in  deducing  thence, %0a%3c according  to  rules  known  only  to  the  proper  authorities,  the  will  of  the %0a%3c gods,  or  the  indications  of  a  fixed  necessity.

Such  as  have  searched  more  closely %0a%3c into  these  Matters  are  of  opinion  that  these  Lightnings %0a%3c come  from  the  Planet  Saturn,  as  the  burning  Lightning  from %0a%3c Mars;  and  with  such  Lightning  was  Volsinii  (a  very  wealthy %0a%3c City  of  the  Tuscans),  entirely  burnt  to  Ashes.  The  Tuscans %0a%3c call  those  Lightnings  familiar  which  presage  the  Fortune %0a%3c of  some  Race,  and  are  significant  during  their  whole  Life  ; %0a%3c and  such  are  they  that  come  first  to  any  Man,  after  he  is %0a%3c newly  entered  into  his  own  Family.  However,  their  Judg- %0a%3c ment is,  that  these  private  Lightnings  do  not  portend  for %0a%3c above  ten  Years :  unless  they  happen  either  upon  the  Day  of %0a%3c first  Marriage,  or  on  a  Birth-day.  Public  Lightnings  be  not %0a%3c of  Force  above  thirty  Years,  except  they  chance  at  the  very %0a%3c Time  that  Towns  or  Colonies  be  erected  and  planted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIII. %0a%3c Of  calling  out  Lightnings. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  appeareth  upon  Record  in  Chronicles,  that  by  certain %0a%3c Sacrifices  and  Prayers1,  Lightnings  may  be  either  compelled %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  There  are  many  proofs  of  imposture  in  these  ancient  ceremonies ;  but %0a%3c when  modern  science  is  able  to  produce  some  of  the  effects  ascribed  to %0a%3c these  Etrurian  priests,  it  seems  just  to  conclude  that  they  may  have  pos- %0a%3c sessed the  secret  of  a  method  of  drawing  the  electric  fluid  from  the  sky. %0a%3c The  danger  attending  a  failure  in  the  requisite  proceedings,  as  in  the  case %0a%3c of  Tullius  Hostilius,  would  necessarily  confine  the  practice  to  an  instructed %0a%3c few ;  whose  credit  for  sanctity  would,  therefore,  be  highly  exalted.  Ovid, %0a%3c in  his  third  book  of  the  "  Fasti,"  obscurely  intimates  the  acquaintance  of %0a%3c Numa  with  such  arts : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  Jupiter  hue  veniet,  valida  perductus  ab  arte  .  .  . %0a%3c %0a%3c ....  quid  agant,  quae  carmina  dicant, %0a%3c Quoque  trahant  superis  sedibus  arte  Jovem." %0a%3c %0a%3c "  To  thee,  by  powerful  art  compelled, %0a%3c Shall  Jupiter  approach  .  .  . %0a%3c %0a%3c ....  And  then  they  tell %0a%3c %0a%3c What  deeds,  what  powerful  charms,  the  Man  must  use, %0a%3c To  draw  the  God  compell'd  from  seats  above." %0a%3c %0a%3c The  secret  consisted  in  Numa's  being  a  scholar  of  Pythagoras,  and  studying %0a%3c "  Quae  sit  rerum  Natura." %0a%3c %0a%3c Wern.

There  is  an  ancient  Report  in %0a%3c Etruria,  that  such  a  Lightning  was  procured  by  Entreaty, %0a%3c when  there  entered  into  the  City  Volsinii  (after  all  the  Terri- %0a%3c tory about  it  was  destroyed)  a  Monster,  which  they  named %0a%3c Volta.  Also,  that  another  was  called  forth  by  P  or  senna, %0a%3c their  King.  Moreover,  L.  Piso  (a  Writer  of  good  Credit) %0a%3c reporteth  in  his  first  Book  of  Annals,  that  Numa  before  him %0a%3c performed  the  same  Act  many  a  Time :  and  when  Tullius %0a%3c Hostilius  would  have  imitated  him  (for  that  he  observed  not %0a%3c all  the  Ceremonies  accordingly),  he  was  himself  struck  with %0a%3c Lightning.  And  for  this  Purpose,  we  have  sacred  Groves, %0a%3c Altars,  and  Sacrifices.  And  among  the  Jupiters  surnamed %0a%3c Statores,  Tonantes,  and  Peretrii,  we  have  heard  that  one %0a%3c also  was  called  Elicius.  Men's  Opinions  are  various  con- %0a%3c cerning this  Point,  and  every  Man  according  to  his  own %0a%3c Liking.  To  believe  that  Nature  may  be  compelled,  is  a  very %0a%3c audacious  Opinion  :  but  it  is  as  senseless  on  the  other  Side %0a%3c to  make  her  Benefits  of  no  effect ;  considering  that  in  the %0a%3c Interpretation  of  Lightning,  Science  hath  thus  far  proceeded %0a%3c as  to  foretell  when  they  will  come  at  a  prescribed  Day  :  and %0a%3c whether  they  will  frustrate  the  Dangers  pronounced,  or %0a%3c rather  open  other  Destinies,  which  lie  hidden  in  innumerable %0a%3c public  and  private  Experiments  of  both  Kinds.  And  there- %0a%3c fore (since  it  hath  so  pleased  Nature)  let  some  of  these  Things %0a%3c be  certain,  others  doubtful :  some  proved,  and  others  con- %0a%3c demned. As  for  us,  we  will  not  omit  the  Rest  which  in %0a%3c these  Matters  are  worth  Remembrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIV. %0a%3c General  Rules  of  Lightning. %0a%3c %0a%3c THAT  the  Lightning  is  seen  before  the  Thunderclap  is %0a%3c heard,  although  they  come  indeed  jointly  together,  is  cer- %0a%3c tain. And  no  Wonder,  for  Light  is  more  rapid  than  Sound. %0a%3c And  yet  Nature  doth  so  modulate,  that  the  Stroke  and %0a%3c Sound  shall  accord  together.  But  when  there  is  a  Noise1, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Ovid  refers  to  this  also,  as  the  popular  opinion.  But  silent  lightning %0a%3c in  a  clear  sky  was  judged  to  be  unaccountable,  except  as  coming  from  the %0a%3c gods.  Hence  Horace,  though  disposed  to  the  doctrines  of  Epicurus,  found %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  93 %0a%3c %0a%3c it  is  a  Sign  of  the  Lightning  proceeding  of  some  natural %0a%3c Cause,  and  not  sent  by  some  God  :  and  yet  a  Breath  cometh %0a%3c before  the  Thunderbolt :  and  hereupon  it  is,  that  every  Thing %0a%3c is  shaken  and  blasted  before  it  is  smitten  :  neither  is  any %0a%3c Man  struck,  who  either  saw  the  Lightning  before,  or  heard %0a%3c the  Thunderclap.  Those  Lightnings  that  are  on  the  left %0a%3c Hand  are  supposed  to  be  prosperous,  for  that  the  East  is  the %0a%3c left  Side  of  the  World  :  but  the  Coming  thereof  is  not  so %0a%3c much  regarded  as  the  Return  :  whether  it  be  that  the  Fire %0a%3c leap  back  after  the  Stroke  given ;  or  whether  after  the  Deed %0a%3c done  and  Fire  spent,  the  Spirit  abovesaid  retire  back  again. %0a%3c In  that  respect  the  Tuscans  have  divided  the  Heaven  into %0a%3c sixteen  Parts.  The  first  is  from  the  North  to  the  Sun's %0a%3c Rising  in  the  Equinoctial  Line  :  the  second,  to  the  Meridian %0a%3c Line,  or  the  South :  the  third,  to  the  Sun-setting  in  the %0a%3c Equinoctial :  and  the  fourth  taketh  up  all  the  Rest  from  the %0a%3c said  West  to  the  North  Star.  These  Quarters  again  they %0a%3c have  parted  each  into  four  Regions :  of  which  eight  from  the %0a%3c Sun-rising  they  called  the  Left ;  and  as  many  again  from %0a%3c the  contrary  Part,  the  Right.  Those  Lightnings  are  most %0a%3c dreadful  which  from  the  Sun-setting  reach  into  the  North : %0a%3c and  therefore  it  is  of  much  importance  from  whence  Light- %0a%3c nings come,  and  whither  they  go :  the  best  Thing  observed %0a%3c in  them,  is  when  they  return  into  the  easterly  Parts.  And, %0a%3c therefore,  when  they  come  from  that  principal  Part  of  the %0a%3c Sky,  and  return  again  into  the  same,  it  portends  the  highest %0a%3c Good  :  and  such  was  the  Sign  given  (by  report)  to  Sylla %0a%3c the  Dictator.  In  all  other  Parts  of  the  World,  they  be  less %0a%3c fortunate  or  dreadful.  They  believe  that  there  be  Light- %0a%3c nings, which  to  utter  abroad  is  held  unlawful ;  as  also  is  to %0a%3c give  Ear  unto  them,  unless  they  be  declared  either  to  Parents %0a%3c or  to  a  Friend.  How  great  is  the  Folly  of  this  Observation %0a%3c was  found  at  Rome  upon  the  blasting  of  Juno's  Temple  by %0a%3c Scaurus,  the  Consul,  who  soon  after  was  President  of  the %0a%3c Senate.  It  lightneth  without  Thunder,  more  in  the  Night %0a%3c %0a%3c his  confidence  staggered  by  this  phenomenon ;  and  Suetonius  informs  us, %0a%3c that  it  was  viewed  by  Titus  as  a  portent  of  evil  to  himself,  just  before  his %0a%3c death;  and  his  spirits  became  proportionally  depressed.  —  Wern.

Acilius  and  C.  Porcius  were  Consuls. %0a%3c And  many  Times  beside  it  rained  Flesh  ;  as,  namely,  whilst %0a%3c L.  Volumnius  and  Serv.  Sulpitius  were  Consuls  :  and  what %0a%3c of  it  the  Fowls  of  the  Air  carried  not  away,  never  putrified. %0a%3c In  like  Manner,  it  rained  Iron  in  Lucania,  the  Year  before %0a%3c that  in  which  M.  Crassus  was  slain  by  the  Parthians;  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  A  coloured  mist  has  been  mentioned,  in  a  note  to  chap,  xxvii.

A %0a%3c similar  circumstance  in  England,  recorded  by  Pennius,  was  supposed %0a%3c to  have  presaged  the  plague.  There  are  sufficient  modern  proofs  that %0a%3c living  fishes,  frogs,  and  other  creatures  or  materials,  have  fallen  in %0a%3c showers  :  in  the  former  instance,  remote  from  the  sea  or  any  great  river. %0a%3c These  things  can  only  be  explained  by  supposing  them  to  have  been  first %0a%3c taken  up  by  some  whirlwind,  or  sudden  gust ;  and  it  is  not  unlikely  that %0a%3c the  ashes  of  a  volcano  were  the  materials  of  some  of  these  showers.  Ovid, %0a%3c by  poetic  license,  accumulates  all  the  bad  omens  on  record  or  in  tradition, %0a%3c hi  the  alarming  prognostications  of  the  death  of  Julius  Caesar  ("  Meta- %0a%3c morphoses," b.  xv.) ;  and  it  may  be  a  principal  reason  why  Pliny  specifies %0a%3c the  times  of  these  occurrences,  to  shew  that  Ovid's  narrative  is  only  a %0a%3c poetic  fiction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  following  translation  of  a  paragraph  in  the  "  Museum  Wormi- %0a%3c anum"  (p.  17,  De  Terris  Miracvlusis),  is  a  specimen  of  the  manner  in %0a%3c which  such  extraordinary  events  were  regarded,  even  at  a  very  modern %0a%3c date  : — "  In  the  year  1619,  when  the  preposterous  fashion  of  neck-bands, %0a%3c kerchiefs,  and  other  female  ornaments  of  linen,  dyed  of  cerulean  blue,  in- %0a%3c vaded Denmark,  and  in  spite  of  the  remonstrances  of  the  ministers  of %0a%3c God  obstinately  persisted,  by  adding  pride  to  luxury,  Almighty  God, %0a%3c that  he  might  by  all  means  declare  how  abhorrent  this  sin  was  to  him, %0a%3c and  recall  mortals  to  repentance  by  a  miracle,  in  many  places  of  Scania %0a%3c rained  down  abundantly  a  kind  of  earth  of  a  blue  colour,  very  similar %0a%3c to  a  sort  sold  by  the  dealers  in  spices.  A  small  quantity  of  this  was %0a%3c given  to  me  at  the  time  by  my  good  friend,  Dr.  Fincking,  professor %0a%3c of  medicine  at  Copenhagen,  &c."

But  in %0a%3c the  Year  that  L.  Paulus  and  C.  Marcellus  were  Consuls,  it %0a%3c rained  Wool  about  the  Castle  Carissa,  near  to  which,  a  Year %0a%3c after,  T.  Annius  Milo  was  slain.  At  the  Time  that  the  same %0a%3c Mito  pleaded  his  own  Cause  at  the  Bar,  there  fell  a  Rain  of %0a%3c Tiles  and  Bricks,  as  is  related  in  the  Records  of  that  Year. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Rustling  of  Armour,  and  the  Sound  of  Trumpets  heard %0a%3c from  Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  the  Time  of  the  Cimbrian  Wars,  we  have  been  told %0a%3c that  Armour  was  heard  to  rustle,  and  the  Trumpet  to  sound, %0a%3c out  of  Heaven.  And  this  happened  very  often,  both  before %0a%3c and  after  those  Wars.  But  in  the  third  Consulship  of %0a%3c Marius,  the  Amerines  and  Tudertes  saw  Men  in  Arms  in  the %0a%3c Sky1,  rushing  one  against  another,  from  the  East  and  West ; %0a%3c and  those  of  the  West  were  discomfited.  That  the  very %0a%3c Firmament  itself  should  be  on  Fire  is  no  Wonder,  for  often %0a%3c it  hath  been  seen  when  Clouds  have  caught  any  great  deal %0a%3c of  Fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LVIII. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  Stones  falling  from  the  Sky*. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Greeks  greatly  celebrate  Anaxagoras  Clazomenius, %0a%3c who,  by  the  Learning  that  he  had  in  Astronomy,  foretold  in %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  was  probably  the  Aurora  Borealis,  or  Northern  Lights;  a %0a%3c phenomenon  rarely  seen  so  far  to  the  South.    It  is,  perhaps,  the  same %0a%3c that  is  referred  to  by  Josephus,  in  his  narrative  of  the  terrors  sent  by %0a%3c God  before  the  fatal  siege  of  Jerusalem.     The  account  of  what  was  seen %0a%3c in  the  county  of  Cumberland,  immediately  preceding  the  invasion  of %0a%3c England  by  the  Pretender,  will  shew  how  nearly  aerial  appearances  may %0a%3c approach  to  realities. — Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  For  a  long  time  the  fall  from  the  sky,  of  what  are  denominated %0a%3c Meteorolites,  was  deemed  too  preposterous  to  be  believed ;  but  since  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  97 %0a%3c %0a%3c the  second  Year  of  the  Seventy-eighth  Olympiad,  what  Time %0a%3c a  Stone  would  fall  from  the  Sun :  and  the  same  happened %0a%3c accordingly,  in  the  Daytime,  in  a  Part  of  Thracia,  near  the %0a%3c River  .ZEgos ;  which  Stone  is  shewed  at  this  Day  as  big  as  a %0a%3c Wain-load,  carrying  a  burnt  Colour :  at  which  Time  a  Comet %0a%3c also  burned  by  Night.  Which  if  any  Man  believe  that  it %0a%3c was  fore-signified,  he  must  needs  also  confess,  that  this  fore- %0a%3c telling by  Anaxagoras  was  more  miraculous  than  the  Thing %0a%3c itself:  and  that  it  destroyed  the  Knowledge  of  Nature's %0a%3c Works,  and  confounds  all  Things,  if  we  should  believe  that %0a%3c either  the  Sun  were  a  Stone,  or  that  ever  any  Stone  were  in %0a%3c it.  But,  that  Stones  fall  often,  no  Man  will  make  any  doubt- %0a%3c In  the  public  Place  of  Exercise  in  Abydos,  there  is  one  at %0a%3c this  Day  upon  the  same  Cause  preserved,  and  held  in  great %0a%3c Reverence  :  it  is  but  of  small  size,  yet  it  is  reported  to  be  the %0a%3c same  that  Anaxagoras  foretold  to  be  about  to  fall  in  the %0a%3c midst  of  the  Earth.  There  is  one  revered  also  at  Cassandria, %0a%3c which  was  called  Potidsea,  a  Colony  from  thence  deducted. %0a%3c I  myself  have  seen  another  in  the  Territory  of  the  Vocantians, %0a%3c which  was  brought  thither  but  a  little  before. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LIX. %0a%3c Of  the  Rainbow. %0a%3c %0a%3c THOSE  which  we  call  Rainbows,  are  seen  often  without  any %0a%3c Wonder,  or  betokening  Portent :  for  they  foretel  not  so  much %0a%3c %0a%3c facts  are  no  longer  doubted,  the  instances  recorded  by  Pliny  become %0a%3c valuable  evidences  of  their  antiquity.  A  still  more  ancient  instance  is %0a%3c found  in  the  Book  of  Joshua,  x.  11,  where,  in  the  conquest  of  Canaan, %0a%3c the  Lord  threw  down  great  stones  from  heaven  on  the  enemy,  and  dis- %0a%3c comfited them.  The  miraculous  nature  of  this  last  transaction  does  not %0a%3c remove  it  from  the  class  of  natural  occurrences ;  for  Nature  itself  is  only %0a%3c an  instrument  in  the  hands  of  its  Creator.  With  regard  to  the  prognos- %0a%3c tication of  Anaxagoras,  it  can  only  be  taken  to  signify  the  high  reputation %0a%3c of  this  philosopber ;  which  led  the  public  to  believe  that  they  could  not %0a%3c attribute  too  much  to  his  insight  into  the  occurrences  of  Nature.  There %0a%3c is  reason  to  suppose  that  some  of  the  images  which  were  said  to  have  fallen %0a%3c down  from  Jupiter  (Acts  of  the  Apostles,  xix.  35)  were  derived  from  tbis %0a%3c source. —  Wern.

Certainly,  they  never %0a%3c are  known  but  opposite  to  the  Sun  ;  nor  at  any  Time  other- %0a%3c wise than  in  Form  of  a  Semicircle ;  nor  yet  in  the  Night %0a%3c Season,  although  Aristotle  saith1  there  was  a  Rainbow  seen %0a%3c by  Night :  however  he  confesseth,  that  it  could  not  possibly %0a%3c be  but  at  the  full  of  the  Moon.  They  happen  for  the  most %0a%3c Part  in  Winter,  chiefly  from  the  Autumnal  Equinox,  as  the %0a%3c Days  decrease.

But  in  Bruma,  that  is %0a%3c to  say,  when  they  be  shortest,  they  appear  often.  The  same %0a%3c appear  aloft  when  the  Sun  is  low  ;  and  below,  when  he  is %0a%3c aloft.  Also,  they  be  of  narrower  Compass  when  the  Sun %0a%3c either  riseth  or  setteth,  but  their  Body  spreadeth  broad  :  and %0a%3c at  Noon  they  are  narrower,  but  wider  in  Circumference.  In %0a%3c Summer  they  be  not  seen  about  Noon,  but  after  the  Autumnal %0a%3c Equinox  at  all  hours ;  and  never  more  than  two  at  once. %0a%3c The  Rest  of  the  same  Nature,  I  see  few  Men  do  make  any %0a%3c doubt  of. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LX. %0a%3c Of  Hail ,  Snow,  Frost,  Mist,  and  Dew. %0a%3c %0a%3c HAIL  is  formed  of  Rain,  congealed  into  Ice :  and  Snow %0a%3c of  the  same  Humour  grown  together,  but  not  so  hard.

And  it  is  not  to  be  regarded  as  merely  a  poetic  metaphor  or %0a%3c idle  declamation,  for  it  was  their  belief  that  the  earliest  origin  of  mankind %0a%3c was  from  the  ground,  by  an  inherent  property ;  as  explained  by  Lucre- %0a%3c tius in  his  Second  Book  on  the  "  Nature  of  Things : "  so  that  each  primi- %0a%3c tive nation  arose  from  its  own  soil.

In  various  parts  of  the  sacred %0a%3c Scriptures  the  exposure  of  the  inanimate  body  is  threatened  as  a  dreadful %0a%3c calamity ;  as  in  the  instance  of  Goliath  to  David  (1  Sam.  xvii.  44) ;  and %0a%3c its  infliction  was  felt  to  be  a  reproach,  by  both  Israelites  and  Philistines, %0a%3c in  the  case  of  Saul  (1  Sam.  xxxi.  12,  13).

For  she %0a%3c entertaineth  no  more  a  Serpent l  after  it  hath  stung  a  Man  : %0a%3c nay,  she  requireth  punishment  for  them  that  are  slow  and %0a%3c negligent  of  themselves  to  seek  it.  She  bringeth  forth  mecli- %0a%3c cinable  Herbs,  and  evermore  produces  Something  good  for %0a%3c Man.  Moreover,  it  may  be  believed,  that  in  compassion  to %0a%3c us,  she  appointed  Poisons2,  that  when  we  were  weary  of  Life, %0a%3c cursed  Famine  (most  adverse  of  all  others  to  the  Merits  of %0a%3c the  Earth)  should  not  consume  us  with  pining  Consump- %0a%3c tion ;  that  lofty  Precipices  should  not  dash  our  Bodies  to %0a%3c pieces  ;  nor  the  preposterous  Punishment  by  the  Halter  dis- %0a%3c tort our  Necks,  and  stop  that  Breath  which  we  seek  to  be  rid %0a%3c of:  last  of  all,  that  we  might  not  seek  our  Death  in  the  Sea, %0a%3c and  so  be  Food  for  Fishes  ;  nor  yet  the  Edge  of  the  Sword %0a%3c mangle  our  Body,  and  so  inflict  extreme  Pain.

Browne's  "  Vulgar  Errors  "  may %0a%3c be  thought  to  do  so  :— "  Some  veins  of  the  earth,  and  also  whole  regions, %0a%3c not  only  destroy  the  life  of  venomous  creatures,  but  also  prevent  their %0a%3c productions." — Wern.

Not  only  are  there  instances  where  diseases  of  no  great %0a%3c severity  were  regarded  as  authorising  this  last  resource,  but  on  the  least %0a%3c disappointment  or  failure  of  success  in  a  public  undertaking  it  was  consi- %0a%3c dered as  a  point  of  honour,  and  an  instance  of  commendable  courage ;  of %0a%3c which  the  case  of  the  illustrious  stoic  Brutus,  at  Philippi,  is  an  eminent %0a%3c instance.     Pliny  seems  not  to  have  imagined  that  no  substance  in  nature %0a%3c is  really  a  poison,  and  that  the  plants  and  minerals  so  denominated  are %0a%3c only  injurious  when  wrongly  or  too  powerfully  administered  ;  their  more %0a%3c concentrated  strength,  when  properly  used,  only  rendering  them  the %0a%3c better  instruments  of  good.—  Wern.

For  in  the  same  Manner  we %0a%3c also  employ  Iron,  which  we  cannot  possibly  be  without.  And %0a%3c yet  we  should  not  do  justly  to  complain,  if  she  had  brought %0a%3c it  forth  to  do  hurt.  Surely  to  this  only  Part  of  Nature  we %0a%3c are  unthankful,  as  though  she  served  not  Man's  Turn  for  all %0a%3c Dainties ;  not  for  Reproach  to  be  misused.  She  is  thrown %0a%3c into  the  Sea,  or  to  let  in  Arms  of  the  Sea,  eaten  away  with %0a%3c Water.  With  Iron  Tools,  with  Wood,  Fire,  Stone,  Burthens %0a%3c of  Corn,  she  is  tormented  every  Hour :  and  all  this  much %0a%3c more  for  our  Pleasures  than  to  serve  us  with  Food  and %0a%3c Necessaries.  And  yet  these  Misusages  which  she  abideth %0a%3c above,  and  in  her  outward  Skin,  may  seem  in  some  Sort %0a%3c tolerable.  But  we  pierce  into  her  very  Bowels  in  search  of %0a%3c Veins  of  Gold  and  Silver,  Copper  and  Lead.  And  to  seek %0a%3c out  Gems  and  some  little  Stones,  we  sink  Pits  deep  in  the %0a%3c Ground.  Thus  we  pluck  the  very  Bowels  from  her  to  wear %0a%3c on  our  Finger  one  Gem  to  fulfil  our  Pleasure,  How  many %0a%3c Hands  are  worn  with  digging,  that  one  Joint  of  our  Finger %0a%3c may  shine !  Surely,  if  there  were  any  infernal  Spirits  be- %0a%3c neath, ere  this  Time  these  Mines  (to  feed  Covetousness  and %0a%3c Luxury)  would  have  brought  them  above  Ground.  Do  we %0a%3c wonder,  then,  if  she  hath  brought  forth  some  Things  hurt- %0a%3c ful ?  But  savage  Beasts  (I  think)  preserve  her ;  they  keep %0a%3c sacrilegious  Hands  from  doing  her  Injury.  Dig  we  not %0a%3c amongst  Dragons  and  Serpents  ?  and,  together  with  Veins  of %0a%3c Gold,  handle  we  not  the  Roots  of  poisonous  Herbs  ?  Never- %0a%3c theless, this  Goddess  we  find  the  more  appeased  for  all  this %0a%3c Misusage,  because  the  End  of  all  this  Wealth  tendeth  to %0a%3c Wickedness,  to  Murders,  and  Wars,  and  her  whom  we %0a%3c drench  with  our  Blood,  we  cover  also  with  unburied  Bones. %0a%3c Which,  nevertheless,  as  if  she  did  reproach  us  for  this  Fury, %0a%3c she  herself  covereth  in  the  End,  and  hideth  even  the  Wick- %0a%3c edness of  Mortals.  Among  other  Imputations  of  an  un- %0a%3c thankful Mind,  I  may  allege  this  also,  that  we  be  ignorant %0a%3c of  her  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  II.]  History  of  Nature.  103 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXIV. %0a%3c Of  the  Form  of  the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  first  Thing  that  offereth  itself  to  be  considered,  is %0a%3c her  Figure,  in  which  by  a  general  Consent  we  all  agree. %0a%3c For  surely  we  utter  nothing  more  commonly  than  the  round %0a%3c Ball1  of  the  Earth  ;  and  confess  that  it  is  a  Globe  enclosed %0a%3c within  two  Poles.  But  yet  the  Form  is  not  that  of  a  perfect %0a%3c Globe,  considering  so  great  Height  of  Mountains,  and  such %0a%3c Extent  of  Plains;  nevertheless,  if  the  Compass  thereof  might %0a%3c be  taken  by  Lines,  the  End  of  those  Lines  would  meet  just %0a%3c in  Circuit,  and  prove  the  Figure  to  be  an  accurate  Circle. %0a%3c And  this  the  very  Consideration  of  natural  Reason  doth %0a%3c convince,  although  there  were  not  those  Causes  which  we %0a%3c alleged  about  the  Heaven.  For  in  it  the  hollow  Convexity %0a%3c declineth  upon  itself,  and  on  every  Side  resteth  upon  the %0a%3c Centre  thereof,  which  is  that  of  the  Earth.  But  this  being %0a%3c solid  and  compact,  ariseth  as  if  it  swelled,  and  is  stretched %0a%3c without.  The  Heaven  inclineth  toward  the  Centre,  but  the %0a%3c Earth  goeth  from  the  Centre ;  whilst  the  World,  with  con- %0a%3c tinual Volubility  and  turning  about  it,  driveth  the  huge %0a%3c Globe  thereof  into  the  Form  of  a  round  Ball. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  Egyptian  Cosmogony,  as  delivered  by  Diodorus  Siculus,  de- %0a%3c scribes the  earth  as  "rolled  within  itself,  and  turned  continually;"  although %0a%3c a  subsequent  idea  was  founded  on  its  being  merely  an  extended  surface, %0a%3c where  the  earth  was  inclosed  within  a  field  of  waters,  which  was  again %0a%3c encompassed  with  darkness  and  impenetrable  mist.  But  after  what %0a%3c Pliny  has  said  in  this,  and  the  immediately  following  chapters,  on  the %0a%3c form  of  the  earth,  and  the  proofs  he  has  given  of  its  being  a  globe,  it %0a%3c seems  surprising  that  a  contrary  opinion  should  have  prevailed,  even  to %0a%3c comparatively  modern  times;  and  especially  among  men  accustomed  to %0a%3c regard  every  thing  delivered  by  the  ancients  as  unquestionably  true.  This %0a%3c perversity  can  only  be  accounted  for  by  having  made  a  religious  dogma %0a%3c of  the  contrary  idea,  on  the  authority  of  some  ill-understood  passages  of %0a%3c Scripture.—  Wern.

Also  of  the %0a%3c Roundness  of  Water. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE  is  here  great  Debate  between  learned  Men ;  and %0a%3c contrariwise  of  the  ignorant  Multitude  :  for  they  hold,  that %0a%3c Men  are  overspread  on  all  Parts  upon  the  Earth,  and  stand %0a%3c one  against  another,  Foot  to  Foot :  also  that  the  Summit  of %0a%3c the  Heaven  is  alike  unto  all :  and  in  what  Part  soever  Men %0a%3c be,  they  still  tread  after  the  same  Manner  in  the  midst.  But %0a%3c the  common  Sort  ask,  How,  then,  it  happeneth,  that  they %0a%3c who  are  opposite  against  us,  do  not  fall  into  Heaven  ?  as  if %0a%3c there  were  not  a  Reason  also  ready,  That  the  Antipodes %0a%3c again  should  wonder  why  we  also  fell  not  off?  Now  there  is %0a%3c Reason  that  cometh  between,  carrying  a  Probability  with  it, %0a%3c even  to  the  untaught  Multitude,  that  in  a  Globe  of  the  Earth, %0a%3c with  many  Ascents,  as  if  its  Figure  resembled  a  Nut  of  the %0a%3c Pine  Tree;  yet,  nevertheless,  it  may  be  well  inhabited  in %0a%3c every  Place.  But  what  Good  doth  all  this,  when  another %0a%3c great  Wonder  ariseth  ?  namely,  that  itself  hangeth,  and %0a%3c falleth  not  with  us:  as  if  the  Power  of  that  Spirit1  especially %0a%3c enclosed  in  the  World  were  doubted:  or  that  any  Thing %0a%3c could  fall  when  Nature  is  repugnant  thereto,  and  affordeth %0a%3c no  Place  whither  to  fall :  for  as  there  is  no  Seat  of  Fire,  but %0a%3c in  Fire ;  of  Water,  but  in  Water ;  of  Air  and  Spirit,  but  in %0a%3c Air ;  even  so  there  is  no  Room  for  Earth  but  in  Earth,  see- %0a%3c ing all  the  Elements  besides  are  ready  to  repel  it  from  them. %0a%3c Nevertheless,  it  is  wonderful  still  how  it  should  become  a %0a%3c Globe,  considering  so  great  Flatness  of  Plains  and  Seas.  Of %0a%3c which  Opinion,  Dicearchus  (a  Man  of  the  first  Rank  in %0a%3c Learning,)  is  a  Favourer  ;  who,  to  satisfy  the  curious  Inquiry %0a%3c of  Kings,  had  a  Commission  to  take  the  Measure  of  Moun- %0a%3c tains :  of  which  he  said  that  Pelion,  the  highest,  was  a  Mile- %0a%3c and-a-half  high  by  the  Plumb-line;  and  collected  thereby, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  What  we  now  know  to  arise  from  the  power  of  gravity,  Pliny  as- %0a%3c cribes to  the  Anima  Mundi,  or  vivifying  effect  of  the  soul  of  the  world ; %0a%3c with  him,  an  answer  to  all  difficulties.— Wern.

But  to  me  this  was  an %0a%3c uncertain  Guess  of  his,  since  I  am  not  ignorant  that  certain %0a%3c Tops  of  the  Alps,  for  a  long  Tract,  arise  not  under  fifty  Miles %0a%3c in  Height. %0a%3c %0a%3c But  this  is  it  that  the  common  People  resist  the  most,  if %0a%3c they  should  be  forced  to  believe  that  the  Form  of  Water  also %0a%3c gathereth  itself  round  at  the  Top.  And  yet  there  is  Nothing %0a%3c in  the  Nature  of  Things  more  evident  to  the  Sight ;  for  the %0a%3c Drops  every  where,  not  only  as  they  hang,  appear  like  little %0a%3c round  Balls ;  but  also  if  they  light  upon  Dust,  or  rest  upon %0a%3c the  Down  of  Leaves,  we  see  them  keep  a  perfect  Roundness. %0a%3c Also  in  Cups  that  are  filled  brimful,  the  middle  Part  in  the %0a%3c Top  swelleth  most.  Which  Things,  considering  the  Thinness %0a%3c of  the  Fluid,  and  its  Softness  settling  upon  itself,  are  sooner %0a%3c found  out  by  Reason  than  the  Eye.  And  this  is  more  won- %0a%3c derful, that  when  Cups  are  filled  to  the  full,  if  a  very  little %0a%3c more  Liquor  be  added,  the  overplus  will  run  over  all  about : %0a%3c but  it  falleth  out  the  contrary,  if  you  put  in  any  solid %0a%3c Weights,  even  if  it  were  to  the  Weight  of  Twenty  Denarii. %0a%3c The  Reason  is,  that  Things  received  within,  lift  up  the  Li- %0a%3c quor aloft  to  the  Top,  but  poured  upon  the  Tumour  that %0a%3c beareth  aloft  above  the  Edges,  it  must  needs  glide  off.  The %0a%3c same  is  the  Reason  why  the  Land  cannot  be  seen  by  them %0a%3c that  stand  on  the  Deck  of  a  Ship,  but  very  plainly  at  the %0a%3c same  time  from  the  Top  of  the  Masts.  Also  as  a  Ship  goeth %0a%3c off  from  the  Land,  if  any  Thing  that  shineth  be  fastened  on %0a%3c the  Top  of  the  Mast,  it  seemeth  to  go  down  into  the  Sea  by %0a%3c little  and  little,  until  at  last  it  is  hidden  entirely.  Last  of %0a%3c all,  the  very  Ocean,  which  we  confess  to  be  the  utmost  Bound %0a%3c environing  the  whole  Globe  :  by  what  other  Figure  could  it %0a%3c hold  together,  since  there  is  no  Bank  beyond  it  to  keep  it %0a%3c in?  And  this  also  cometh  to  be  a  Wonder  how  it  happeneth, %0a%3c although  the  Sea  grow  to  be  round,  that  the  utmost  Edge %0a%3c thereof  falleth  not  down  ?  Against  which,  if  that  the  Seas %0a%3c were  plain,  and  of  the  Form  they  seem  to  be,  the  Greek %0a%3c Philosophers,  to  their  own  great  Joy  and  Glory,  prove  by %0a%3c geometrical  Demonstration,  that  it  cannot  possibly  be  that %0a%3c the  Water  should  fall.

[BOOK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c from  above  to  the  lower  Parts,  and  that  all  Men  confess  that %0a%3c this  is  their  Nature,  and  no  Man  doubteth  that  the  Water  of %0a%3c the  Sea  hath  always  come  on  any  Shore  so  far  as  the  Sloping %0a%3c would  have  suffered :  doubtless  it  appeareth,  that  the  lower %0a%3c a  Thing  is,  the  nearer  it  is  to  the  Centre ;  and  that  all  the %0a%3c Lines  which  from  thence  are  sent  out  to  the  next  Waters,  are %0a%3c shorter  than  those  which  from  the  first  Waters  reach  to  the %0a%3c utmost  Extremity  of  the  Sea.

And  this  we  must  believe,  that  Nature,  the %0a%3c Work-mistress,  framed  it  so  :  to  the  End  that  the  Earth, %0a%3c which  being  dry  could  not  by  itself,  without  some  Moisture, %0a%3c keep  any  Consistence ;  and  the  Fluid,  likewise,  which  could %0a%3c not  abide,  unless  the  Earth  upheld  it,  might  mutually  em- %0a%3c brace one  another  ;  the  one  opening  all  the  Creeks,  and  the %0a%3c other  running  wholly  into  the  other,  by  the  Means  of  secret %0a%3c Veins  within,  without,  and  above,  like  Bands  to  clasp  it ; %0a%3c yea,  and  so  break  out  at  the  Tops  of  the  Hills :  whither %0a%3c being  partly  carried  by  a  Spirit,  and  partly  expressed  by  the %0a%3c Weight  of  the  Earth,  it  mounteth,  as  it  were,  in  Pipes :  and %0a%3c so  far  is  it  from  Danger  of  falling  away,  that  it  leapeth  up %0a%3c to  the  highest  and  loftiest  Things.  By  which  Reason  it  is %0a%3c evident,  why  the  Seas  do  not  increase,  although  so  many %0a%3c Rivers  daily  run  into  them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXVI. %0a%3c How  the  Water  is  united  to  the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  Earth,  therefore,  in  its  whole  Globe,  is  in  the  midst %0a%3c thereof  hemmed  in  with  the  Sea,  that  flows  round  about  it. %0a%3c And  this  needeth  not  to  be  sought  out  by  Argument,  for  it  is %0a%3c known  already  by  Experience. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXVII. %0a%3c Navigation  upon  the  Sea  and  great  Rivers. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM  Gades  and  the  Pillars  of  Hercules,  the  whole  of  the %0a%3c West  Sea  is  at  this  Day  sailed  over  in  the  whole  Compass  of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  107 %0a%3c %0a%3c Spain  and  France.  But  the  North  Ocean  was  for  the  most %0a%3c Part  discovered,  under  the  Conduct  of  Divus  Augustus %0a%3c Casar1,  who,  with  a  Fleet,  compassed  Germany,  and  as  far %0a%3c as  to  the  Cape  of  the  Cimbrians :  and  from  thence  having %0a%3c viewed  the  vast  Sea,  or  taken  Knowledge  thereof  by  Report, %0a%3c he  passed  to  the  Scythian  Climate  and  those  cold  Coasts %0a%3c abounding  with  too  much  Moisture.  For  which  Cause  tKere %0a%3c is  no  likelihood,  that  in  those  Parts  the  Seas  are  at  an  End, %0a%3c where  the  Power  of  Moisture  predominates.  And  near  it, %0a%3c from  the  East,  out  of  the  Indian  Sea,  that  whole  Part  under %0a%3c the  same  Clime  which  bendeth  toward  the  Caspian  Sea,  was %0a%3c sailed  throughout  by  the  Macedonian  Armies,  when  Seleucus %0a%3c and  Antiochus  reigned,  who  commanded  that  Seleucida %0a%3c and  Antiochida  should  bear  their  Names.  About  the  Caspian %0a%3c Sea,  also,  many  Coasts  of  the  Ocean  have  been  discovered ; %0a%3c and  by  Piecemeal,  rather  than  all  at  once,  the  North  of  one %0a%3c Side  or  other  hath  been  sailed  or  rowed  over.  But  to  put %0a%3c all  out  of  Conjecture,  there  is  a  great  Argument  collected  by %0a%3c the  Palus  Maeotis,  whether  it  be  a  Gulf  of  that  Ocean  (as %0a%3c many  have  believed)  or  an  overflowing  of  the  same,  divided %0a%3c from  it  by  a  narrow  Piece  of  the  Continent.  In  another  Side %0a%3c of  Gades,  from  the  same,  West,  a  great  Part  of  the  South %0a%3c Gulf,  round  about  Mauritania,  is  at  this  Day  sailed.  And, %0a%3c indeed,  the  greater  Part  of  it,  as  well  as  of  the  East,  also  the %0a%3c Victories  of  Alexander  the  Great  encompassed  on  every  Side, %0a%3c as  far  as  to  the  Arabian  Gulf.  Wherein,  when  Cams  Ccesar %0a%3c the  son  of  Augustus  warred  in  those  Parts,  the  Marks  are %0a%3c reported  to  have  been  seen  remaining  from  the  Spaniards' %0a%3c Shipwreck.  Hanno,  likewise,  in  the  Time  that  the  Power  of %0a%3c Carthage  flourished,  sailed  round  from  Gades  to  the  utmost %0a%3c Bounds  of  Arabia2,  and  set  down  that  Voyage  in  Writing : %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  This  can  only  refer  to  an  expedition,  mentioned  by  Suetonius  in  his %0a%3c life  of  the  Emperor  Claudius,  of  Drusus,  the  son  of  Livia ;  who,  while %0a%3c commanding  in  the  Rhetian  and  German  wars,  was  the  first  of  the  Romans %0a%3c that  navigated  the  Northern  Ocean. —  Wem.

Gosselin,  who  insists  upon  termi- %0a%3c nating it  about  the  river  Nun.  According  to  these  authorities,  Pliny  has %0a%3c greatly  extended  the  voyage  of  Hanno,  when  he  says  he  reached  the  utmost %0a%3c bounds  of  Arabia.  Herodotus  does  not  seem  to  have  been  informed  of  this %0a%3c voyage  of  Hanno,  he  merely  says  ("  Melpomene,"  xliii.) : — "  The  Cartha- %0a%3c ginians affirm,  that  they  ascertained  that  Libya  is  surrounded  by  the  sea." %0a%3c — Wern.  Club. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Strabo  has  thrown  some  discredit  on  the  voyage  of  Eudoxus  to  make %0a%3c the  circuit  of  Africa :  but  he  does  not  seem  to  adduce  any  argument  strong %0a%3c enough  to  controvert  the  general  belief  of  antiquity,  that  repeated  at- %0a%3c tempts were  made  by  Eudoxus  to  explore  the  unknown  coasts  of  the %0a%3c African  continent.  He  was  a  native  of  Cyzicus,  and  employed  first  by %0a%3c Ptolemy  Euergetes,  and  afterwards  at  his  own  instigation,  in  several %0a%3c maritime  expeditions.  A  digest  of  the  narratives  of  Strabo  respecting %0a%3c these  voyages  of  Eudoxus,  may  be  seen  in  Murray's  "  Encyclopedia  of %0a%3c Geography,"  p.  14. %0a%3c %0a%3c That  the  circumnavigation  of  Africa  was  really  accomplished,  even %0a%3c prior  to  the  time  of  Herodotus,  we  learn  from  "  Melpomene,"  xlii.  "  For %0a%3c Libya  is  clearly  surrounded  by  the  sea,  except  so  much  of  it  as  borders  on %0a%3c Asia ;  this,  Neco,  king  of  the  Egyptians,  was  the  first  we  know  of  to %0a%3c demonstrate.  That  prince,  having  ceased  his  excavations  for  the  canal %0a%3c leading  out  of  the  Nile  into  the  Arabian  Gulf,  despatched  certain  natives %0a%3c of  Phoenicia  on  shipboard,  with  orders  to  sail  back  through  the  Pillars %0a%3c of  Hercules,  even  into  the  North  Sea,  and  so  make  good  their  return  into %0a%3c Egypt.  The  Phosnicians  of  consequence  having  departed  out  of  the  Ery- %0a%3c threan  Sea,  proceeded  on  their  voyage  in  the  Southern  Sea  :  when  it  was %0a%3c autumn,  they  would  push  ashore,  and  sowing  the  land,  whatever  might %0a%3c be  the  part  of  Libya  they  had  reached,  await  the  harvest  time :  having %0a%3c reaped  their  corn,  they  used  to  continue  their  voyage :  thus,  after  the %0a%3c lapse  of  two  years,  having  in  the  third  doubled  the  Pillars  of  Hercules, %0a%3c they  came  back  into  Egypt ;  and  stated  what  is  not  credible  to  me,  but %0a%3c may  be  so,  perhaps,  to  some,  that  in  their  circumnavigation  of  Libya  they %0a%3c had  the  sun  on  the  right.

In  the  fourteenth  book  of  the  "  Odys- %0a%3c sey," Ulysses  represents  himself  as  having  narrowly  escaped  a  snare  of  this %0a%3c kind;  and  as  the  whole  narrative  is  an  artful  fiction,  intended  to  have %0a%3c the  appearance  of  truth  to  an  Ithacan  peasant,  the  practice  of  kidnapping %0a%3c slaves  could  not  then  have  appeared  incredible  to  any  inhabitant  of  that %0a%3c island : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "  A  false  Phoenician,  of  insidious  mind, %0a%3c Versed  in  vile  arts,  and  foe  to  humankind, %0a%3c With  semblance  fair  invites  me  to  his  home ; %0a%3c I  seized  the  proffer  (ever  fond  to  roam)  : %0a%3c Domestic  in  his  faithless  roof  I  stay'd, %0a%3c Till  the  swift  sun  his  annual  circle  made. %0a%3c To  Libya  then  he  meditates  the  way ; %0a%3c With  guileful  art  a  stranger  to  betray, %0a%3c And  sell  to  bondage  in  a  foreign  land : %0a%3c Much  doubting,  yet  compell'd,  I  quit  the  strand. %0a%3c *  *  *  *  * %0a%3c %0a%3c *  *    but  Jove's  intent %0a%3c %0a%3c Was  yet  to  save  the  oppress'd  and  innocent." — POPE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tacitus  ("Agricola,"  cap.  xxviii.)  mentions  an  instance  of  shipwrecked %0a%3c persons  having  been  treated  as  pirates,  and  sold  into  slavery.  He  is  speak- %0a%3c ing of  a  cohort  of  the  Usipians  serving  in  Britain,  who,  having  left  the %0a%3c island  in  three  light  galleys,  became  the  sport  of  winds  and  waves.  In %0a%3c this  distress  they  sailed  round  the  extremity  of  the  island,  and,  through %0a%3c want  of  skill  in  navigation,  were  wrecked  on  the  Continent,  where  they %0a%3c were  treated  as  pirates,  first  by  the  Suevians,  and  afterwards  by  the  Fri- %0a%3c sians. Being  sold  to  slavery,  and  in  the  way  of  commerce  turned  over  to %0a%3c different  masters,  some  of  them  reached  the  Roman  settlements  on  the %0a%3c banks  of  the  Rhine,  and  there  grew  famous  for  their  sufferings,  and  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110  History  of  Nature.

Surely  the  possession  of  so  vast  a  Mass %0a%3c must  be  excessive  and  infinite.  Add  to  this,  that  of  that %0a%3c which  is  left,  the  Heaven  hath  taken  away  the  greater  Part. %0a%3c For  whereas  there  be  of  the  Heaven  five  Parts,  which  they %0a%3c %0a%3c bold  singularity  of  their  voyage.  —  See  the  "  Agricola  "  of  Tacitus,  cap. %0a%3c xxviii.,  translated  by  Murphy. %0a%3c %0a%3c It  would  even  appear  that  such  distressed  strangers  were  deemed  a %0a%3c proper  sacrifice  to  the  gods :  Herodotus  reports  it  as  a  tradition  (book  ii.) %0a%3c that  when  Hercules,  in  his  journeyings,  arrived  in  Egypt,  the  Egyptians %0a%3c crowned  him  with  a  garland,  and  designed  to  sacrifice  him  to  Jupiter,  if %0a%3c he  had  not  delivered  himself  by  his  great  strength.  The  objection  of  the %0a%3c historian  to  this  story,  on  the  ground  of  the  unbloody  sacrifices  of  the %0a%3c Egyptians,  is  sufficiently  answered  by  the  fact  that  they  were  in  the  habit %0a%3c of  sacrificing  red-haired  men  to  their  evil  deity.  Again,  in  his  fourth  book, %0a%3c he  says,  that  the  Taurians,  a  people  of  Scythia,  were  accustomed  to  sacrifice %0a%3c to  a  virgin  all  strangers  that  suffered  shipwreck  on  their  coast,  and  all %0a%3c Grecian  sailors  they  were  able  to  seize.  The  people  of  Israel,  on  the  con- %0a%3c trary, were  commanded  by  their  law  kindly  to  welcome  strangers;  for %0a%3c they  themselves  had  been  strangers  in  a  foreign  land. —  Wern.

Hence  the  ignorance  of  geography  manifested  by  Pliny %0a%3c and  other  writers,  long  after  these  celebrated  voyagers  had  effected  the %0a%3c circumnavigation  of  Africa.     Polybius,  whose  history  was  written  about %0a%3c 150  years  B.  c.,  and  who  was  particularly  distinguished  by  his  attention %0a%3c to  geographical  researches,  affirms  that  it  was  not  known,  in  his  time, %0a%3c whether  Africa  was  a  continued  continent  stretching  to  the  south,  or %0a%3c whether  it  was  encompassed  by  the  sea.     Strabo  mentions,  indeed,  the %0a%3c voyage  of  Eudoxus,  but  treats  it  as  a  fabulous  tale :  and  Ptolemy,  the %0a%3c most  inquisitive  and  learned  of  all  the  ancient  geographers,  was  equally %0a%3c unacquainted  with  any  parts  of  Africa  situated  a  few  degrees  beyond  the %0a%3c Equinoctial  Line ;  for  he  supposes  that  this  great  continent  was  not %0a%3c surrounded  by  the  sea,  but  that  it  stretched,  without  interruption,  to- %0a%3c wards the  South  Pole ;  and  he  so  far  mistakes  its  true  figure,  that  he %0a%3c describes  it  as  becoming  broader  and  broader  as  it  advances  towards  the %0a%3c South. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  notion  of  the  ancients  concerning  such  an  excessive  degree  of  heat %0a%3c in  the  Torrid  Zone  as  rendered  it  uninhabitable,  and  their  persisting  in %0a%3c this  error  long  after  they  began  to  have  some  commercial  intercourse  with %0a%3c several  parts  of  India  lying  within  the  Tropics,  is  very  extraordinary. %0a%3c Pliny,  in  this  chapter,  falls  in  with  both  these  errors  :  and  Cicero  ("  Som- %0a%3c nium  Scipionis")  holds  the  same  opinion, — and  other  authorities  might  be %0a%3c adduced. — See  the  Notes  to  Robertson's  "  History  of  America,"  where  he %0a%3c attempts  to  account  for  the  apparent  inconsistency  of  the  ancients  with %0a%3c respect  to  their  theory  and  experience. — Wern.

For,  unless  it  were  in  the %0a%3c midst,  the  Instruments  called  Dioptrce  have  proved  that %0a%3c Nights  and  Days  could  not  be  found  equal :  and  those  In- %0a%3c struments, above  all  other,  confirm  the  same  :  seeing  that  in %0a%3c the  Equinox,  by  the  same  Line,  both  Rising  and  Setting  of %0a%3c the  Sun  are  seen  ;  but  the  Summer  Sun  rising,  and  the  Win- %0a%3c ter setting,  by  their  own  several  Lines.  Which  could  by  no %0a%3c means  happen  if  the  Earth  resteth  not  in  the  Centre. %0a%3c %0a%3c « %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of  the  Unequal  Rising  of  the  Stars:  of  the  Eclipse,  both %0a%3c where  and  how  it  cometh. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE  are  three  Circles  closed  within  the  Zones  afore- %0a%3c named, which  distinguish  the  Inequalities  of  the  Days : %0a%3c which  are,  the  (Summer)  Solstitial  Tropic,  from  the  highest %0a%3c Part  of  the  Zodiac,  in  regard  of  us,  toward  the  North  Clime  ; %0a%3c and  against  it,  another  called  the  Winter  Tropic,  toward  the %0a%3c Southern  Pole  :  and  in  like  Manner  the  Equinoctial,  which %0a%3c goeth  in  the  midst  of  the  Zodiac  Circle.  The  Cause  of  the %0a%3c rest,  which  we  wonder  at,  is  in  the  Figure  of  the  Earth  itself, %0a%3c which,  together  with  the  Water,  is,  by  the  same  Arguments, %0a%3c known  to  be  like  a  Globe :  for  so,  doubtless,  it  cometh  to %0a%3c pass,  that  with  us  the  Stars  about  the  North  Pole  never  set ; %0a%3c and  those  contrariwise  of  the  South,  never  rise.  And  again, %0a%3c those  which  are  here  be  not  seen  of  them,  by  Reason  that  the %0a%3c Globe  of  the  Earth  swelleth  up  in  the  midst  between.  Again, %0a%3c Trogloditine,  and  Egypt  bordering  upon  it,  never  see  the %0a%3c North  Pole  Stars :  neither  hath  Italy  a  Sight  of  Canopus,  or %0a%3c that  which  they  name  Berenice's  Hair.

And  so  evidently %0a%3c bendeth  the  Convexity  of  the  Earth,  that  Canopus  at  Alex- %0a%3c andria seemeth  to  the  Beholders  elevated  above  the  Earth %0a%3c almost  one-fourth  Part  of  a  Sign  ;  but  at  Rhodes,  the  same %0a%3c appeareth  almost  to  touch  the  very  Horizon,  and  in  Pontus, %0a%3c where  the  Elevation  of  the  North  Pole  is  highest,  it  is  not %0a%3c seen  at  all :  yea,  and  this  same  Pole  at  Rhodes  is  hidden, %0a%3c but  more  in  Alexandria.  In  Arabia  it  is  all  hid  at  the  first %0a%3c Watch  of  the  Night  in  November ;  but  at  the  second,  it  is %0a%3c visible.  In  Meroe,  at  Midsummer,  in  the  Evening,  it  ap- %0a%3c peareth for  a  while  ;  but  some  few  Days  before  the  Rising %0a%3c of  Arcturus  it  is  seen  with  the  very  Dawning  of  the  Day. %0a%3c Sailors,  by  their  Voyages,  come  to  the  Knowledge  of  these %0a%3c Stars  most  of  any  other,  by  Reason  that  some  Seas  are  oppo- %0a%3c site unto  some  Stars ;  but  others  lie  flat  and  incline  forward %0a%3c to  others  :  so  that  also  those  Pole  Stars  appear  suddenly,  as %0a%3c rising  out  of  the  Sea,  which  lay  hidden  before  under  the %0a%3c winding  Compass  of  a  Ball.  For  the  Heaven  (Mundus) %0a%3c riseth  not  aloft  in  this  higher  Pole,  as  some  Men  have  said ; %0a%3c for  if  so,  these  Stars  should  be  seen  in  every  Place  :  but  those %0a%3c that  to  the  nearest  Observers  are  supposed  to  be  higher,  the %0a%3c same  seem  to  them  afar  off  to  be  immersed  in  the  Sea.  And %0a%3c as  this  North  Pole  seemeth  to  be  aloft  to  those  that  are %0a%3c situated  directly  under  it,  so  to  them  that  be  removed  so  far %0a%3c as  the  other  Devexity  or  Fall  of  the  Earth,  those  abovesaid %0a%3c Stars  rise  up  aloft  there,  while  these  decline  downward  which %0a%3c here  were  mounted  on  high.  Which  Thing  could  not  possibly %0a%3c fall  out  but  in  the  Figure  of  a  Ball.  And  hence  it  is,  that %0a%3c the  Inhabitants  of  the  East  perceive  not  the  Eclipses  of  the %0a%3c Sun  and  Moon  in  the  Evening,  no  more  than  those  that %0a%3c dwell  West  in  the  Morning :  but  those  that  be  at  Noon  in  the %0a%3c South  they  often  see.  At  the  Time  that  Alexander  the  Great %0a%3c obtained  his  famous  Victory  at  Arbela,  it  is  said  that  the %0a%3c Moon  was  eclipsed  at  the  second  Hour  of  the  Night :  but  this %0a%3c Eclipse  was  at  the  Time  of  her  Rising  in  Sicily.

In  Africa  and  Spain %0a%3c there  were  raised  by  Annibal,  high  Watch-towers  :  and  in %0a%3c Asia,  for  the  Fear  of  Pirates,  the  like  Help  of  Beacons  was %0a%3c erected.  Wherein  it  was  observed  oftentimes,  that  the  Fires %0a%3c giving  Warning  before  (which  were  set  on  Fire  at  the  sixth %0a%3c Hour  of  the  Day),  were  descried  by  them  that  were  farthest %0a%3c off  in  Asia,  at  the  third  Hour  of  the  Night.  Philonides,  the %0a%3c Courier  of  the  same  Alexander,  despatched  in  nine  Hours  of %0a%3c the  Day  1200  Stadia,  as  far  as  from  Sicyone  to  Elis :  and %0a%3c from  thence  again  (although  he  went  down  Hill  all  the  Way) %0a%3c he  returned  oftentimes,  but  not  before  the  third  Hour  of  the %0a%3c Night.  The  Cause  was,  because  he  had  the  Sun  with  him  in %0a%3c his  Setting  out ;  and  in  his  Return  to  Sicyon  he  went  against %0a%3c it,  and  ere  he  came  home,  left  it  in  the  West  behind.  Which %0a%3c is  the  Reason  also,  that  they  who  by  Daylight  sail  Westward %0a%3c in  the  shortest  Day  of  the  Year,  pass  along  more  Way  than %0a%3c those  who  sail  all  the  Night  long  at  the  same  Time,  because %0a%3c the  others  accompany  the  Sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  These  effects  of  longitude  are  either  greatly  exaggerated  or  untrue. %0a%3c -—  Wem.

But  in  the %0a%3c city  of  Rome  the  Shadow  wanteth  the  ninth  Part  of  the %0a%3c Gnomon.  In  the  Town  of  Ancona  it  is  longer  by  a  thirty- %0a%3c fifth  Part.

Which  also  at  the  same %0a%3c Time  happeneth  in  India,  above  the  River  Hypasis,  as  Onesi- %0a%3c critus  hath  written.  And  it  is  known  that  in  Berenice,  a %0a%3c City  of  the  Trogloditse,  and  from  thence  4820  Stadia  in  the %0a%3c same  Country,  at  the  Town  of  Ptolemais  (which  was  built  at %0a%3c first  on  the  Border  of  the  Red  Sea,  for  the  Pleasure  of  hunt- %0a%3c ing Elephants),  the  same  is  to  be  seen  forty-five  Days  before %0a%3c the  Summer  Solstice,  and  as  long  after  :  so  that  for  the %0a%3c Space  of  ninety  Days  all  Shadows  are  cast  toward  the  South. %0a%3c Again,  in  the  Island  of  Meroe,  which  is  the  capital  Place  of %0a%3c the  Ethiopian  Nation,  and  is  inhabited  5000  Stadia  from %0a%3c Syene,  upon  the  River  Nile,  twice  in  the  Year  the  Shadows %0a%3c disappear ;  which  is,  when  the  Sun  is  in  the  eighteenth  De- %0a%3c grees of  Taurus ,  and  in  the  fourteenth  of  Leo.

In  the  same %0a%3c India,  at  Patales  (a  famous  Port),  the  Sun  riseth  on  the %0a%3c right  Hand,  and  Shadows  fall  to  the  South.  While  Alex- %0a%3c ander was  there,  Onesicritus,  an  Officer  of  his,  wrote  that  it %0a%3c was  observed  there,  that  the  North  Star  was  seen  the  first %0a%3c Part  only  of  the  Night :  also  that  in  such  Places  of  India  where %0a%3c there  were  no  Shadows,  the  North  Star  did  not  appear :  and %0a%3c that  those  Quarters  were  called  Ascia*9  where  they  kept  no %0a%3c Reckoning  of  Hours. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXIV. %0a%3c %0a%3c Where  Twice  in  the  Year  the  Shadows  fall  in  contrary %0a%3c Directions. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT  throughout  all  Trogloditice,  -Eratosthenes  hath  writ- %0a%3c ten, that  the  Shadows  twice  a- Year,  for  forty-five  Days,  fall %0a%3c in  contrary  Directions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXV. %0a%3c Where  the  Day  is  longest,  and  where  shortest. %0a%3c %0a%3c IT  cometh  thus  to  pass,  that  by  the  variable  Increment  of %0a%3c the  Daylight,  the  longest  Day  in  Meroe  doth  comprehend %0a%3c twelve  equinoctial  Hours,  and  eight  Parts  of  one  Hour:  but %0a%3c in  Alexandria,  fourteen  Hours ;  in  Italy,  fifteen ;  in  Britain, %0a%3c seventeen,  where,  in  Summer,  the  Nights  being  light,  by %0a%3c infallible  Experience  shew  that  which  Reason  forceth  to  be- %0a%3c lieve :  namely,  that  at  Midsummer,  as  the  Sun  approacheth %0a%3c near  to  the  Pole  of  the  World,  the  Places  of  the  Earth  lying %0a%3c underneath,  have  Day  continually  for  six  Months:  and  con- %0a%3c trariwise, Night,  when  the  Sun  is  remote  as  far  as  Bruma. %0a%3c And  this,  Pythias  of  Massiles  hath  written  of  Thule2,  an %0a%3c Island  distant  Northward  from  Britain  six  Days'  sailing  ;  and %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  That  is,  without  shadow. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2  This  is  judged  to  be  Iceland.

And  if  it  be  true,  as %0a%3c it  is  reported,  of  Anaximander,  the  Milesian  Natural  Philo- %0a%3c sopher, his  Foreknowledge  of  Things  was  excellent  and  wor- %0a%3c thy of  Immortality  :  for  they  say  he  forewarned  the  Lacede- %0a%3c monians to  look  well  to  their  City  and  Dwelling-houses,  for %0a%3c that  an  Earthquake  approached ;  which  fell  out  accord- %0a%3c ingly :  when  not  only  their  whole  City  was  shaken,  but  also %0a%3c a  great  Part  of  the  Mountain  Taygetus,  which  projected  like %0a%3c %0a%3c one ;  and  which  may  be  attended  with  tidal  and  sound  waves,  dependent %0a%3c upon  the  former,  and  upon  circumstances  of  position  as  to  sea  and  land.— %0a%3c MALLET  :  Transactions  of  Royal  Irish  Academy,  vol.  xix. %0a%3c %0a%3c The  causes,  and  many  of  the  attending  phenomena,  are  as  much  a %0a%3c matter  of  conjecture  now  as  when  Pliny  wrote ;  but  he  does  not  even %0a%3c deem  worthy  of  notice  the  popular  supposition,  that  the  giants  who  had %0a%3c rebelled  against  the  gods  were  buried  beneath  these  mountains,  where %0a%3c by  their  struggles  they  gave  occasion  to  those  commotions  :  nor  that  the %0a%3c shop  of  Vulcan  was  beneath  Etna,  of  which  the  crater  was  the  chimney. %0a%3c It  is  more  remarkable  that  he  makes  no  reference  to  the  idea  of  Pytha- %0a%3c goras (Ovid's  "  Metamorphoses,"  b.  xv.),  that  the  phenomena  of  volcanic %0a%3c eruption  was  a  vital  action  of  the  earth,  regarded  as  an  animal ;  for  that %0a%3c the  earth  was  such  we  find  Pliny  expressing  a  decided  opinion.  But  the %0a%3c concluding  explanation  of  the  poet,  however,  was  that  which  best  suited %0a%3c his  inquiries. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ceremonies  concerning  Earthquakes. — Whilst  it  was  a  maxim  of  the %0a%3c state  religion,  that  earthquakes  were  caused  by  the  displeasure  of  some %0a%3c divinity,  it  was  still  necessary  that  each  occurrence  of  such  phenomenon %0a%3c should  be  fully  announced  by  the  proper  officers,  before  the  religious %0a%3c observances  appropriate  to  the  case  could  be  required  ;  and  thus  was  se- %0a%3c cured a  guard  against  such  alarms  as  might  agitate  the  public  mind,  if %0a%3c any  neglect  might  seem  to  arise.  The  ceremonies  were  by  public  an- %0a%3c nouncement ;  and  they  were  so  imperative  upon  all,  that  any  one  engaging %0a%3c in  ordinary  work  at  the  time  of  these  feriae  would  be  judged  to  have %0a%3c violated  them.  The  salutation  to  the  divine  power  that  may  have  caused %0a%3c the  shock  was,  "  Si  Deo,  si  Dea,"  &c.,  to  obviate  the  danger  of  an  error %0a%3c regarding  which  god,  or  which  sex  of  these  deities,  had  caused  the  calamity. %0a%3c And  this  was  of  importance,  because  if  a  wrong  name  were  called,  so  far %0a%3c from  being  pacified,  the  real  author  might  become  still  more  offended. — %0a%3c From  Aulus  Gellius.—  Wern.

But  I  leave  these  Things  free %0a%3c for  every  Man  to  weigh  according  to  his  Judgment :  and  for %0a%3c my  own  Part,  I  suppose  that,  without  Doubt,  the  Winds  are %0a%3c the  proper  Cause.  For  the  Earth  never  quakes  but  when %0a%3c the  Sea  is  still,  and  the  Weather  so  calm  that  Birds,  in  their %0a%3c flying,  cannot  hover  in  the  Air;  because  all  the  Spirit  which %0a%3c should  bear  them  up,  is  withdrawn  :  nor  yet  at  any  Time,  but %0a%3c after  the  Winds  are  laid ;  namely,  when  the  Blast  is  hidden %0a%3c within  the  Veins  and  Caves  of  the  Earth.  Neither  is  this %0a%3c Shaking  in  the  Earth  any  other  Thing  than  is  Thunder  in  the %0a%3c Cloud  :  nor  the  Chasm  thereof  aught  else,  but,  like  the  Cleft %0a%3c out  of  which  the  Lightning  breaketh,  when  the  Spirit  enclosed %0a%3c within  struggleth  and  stirreth  to  go  forth  at  Liberty. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER   LXXX. %0a%3c Of  Chasms  of  the  Earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c VARIOUSLY,  therefore,  the  Earth  is  shaken,  and  thereupon %0a%3c ensue  wonderful  Effects.  In  one  Place  the  Walls  of  Cities %0a%3c are  laid  prostrate  :  in  another  they  are  swallowed  up  in  a  deep %0a%3c Chasm  :  here  are  cast  up  mighty  Heaps  of  Earth  ;  there  are %0a%3c poured  out  Rivers  of  Water;  sometimes  Fire  doth  burst  forth, %0a%3c and  hot  Springs  :  and  again  the  Course  of  Rivers  is  turned %0a%3c away  backward.  There  goeth  before  and  cometh  with  it  a %0a%3c terrible  Noise  :  one  while  a  Rumbling  more  like  the  lowing %0a%3c of  Beasts :  and  then  again  it  resembleth  a  Man's  Voice,  or %0a%3c the  clattering  and  rustling  of  Armour  and  Weapons;  accord- %0a%3c ing to  the  Quality  of  the  Matter  that  receiveth  the  Noise,  or %0a%3c the  Fashion  either  of  the  hollow  Caverns  within,  or  the %0a%3c Cranny  by  which  it  passeth  ;  whilst  in  a  narrow  Way  it %0a%3c soundeth  with  a  more  slender  Tone  :  and  the  same  keepeth %0a%3c an  hoarse  Din  in  winding  Caves  ;  rebounding  again  in  hard %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 122  History  of  Nature.

I  myself %0a%3c have  known  by  examination,  that  the  Alps  and  Apennines %0a%3c have  oftentimes  trembled.  In  the  Autumn  and  Spring  there %0a%3c happen  more  Earthquakes  than  at  other  Times,  the  same  as %0a%3c Lightnings.  And,  therefore,  Gallia  and  Egypt  least  of  all  be %0a%3c shaken :  for  in  Egypt  the  continual  Summer1,  and  in  Gallia %0a%3c the  Winter,  is  against  it.  Also,  Earthquakes  are  more  rife %0a%3c by  Night  than  by  Day.  But  the  greatest  Shocks  are  in  the %0a%3c Morning  and  Evening.  Toward  Daylight  there  be  many : %0a%3c and  if  by  Day,  it  is  usually  about  Noon.  They  are  also %0a%3c when  the  Sun  and  Moon  are  eclipsed,  because  then  Tempests %0a%3c are  laid  to  Rest:  but  especially,  when  after  much  Rain  there %0a%3c followeth  a  great  Heat;  or  after  Heat,  much  Rain. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXXI. %0a%3c Signs  of  Approaching  Earthquakes. %0a%3c %0a%3c SAILORS  also  perceive  it  by  an  undoubting  Conjecture, %0a%3c when  the  Waves  swell  suddenly  without  any  Gale  of  Wind, %0a%3c or  when  they  feel  a  Shock.

Several  coincidences  of  this  kind  have  been  remarked; %0a%3c and  in  either  case  they  are  applicable  to  Egypt  above  other  countries. — %0a%3c Wern.

And  in  the %0a%3c same  Towns,  those  Parts  which  be  pendant  are  the  safer :  as %0a%3c is  well  seen  in  Naples,  in  Italy,  where  that  Quarter  thereof %0a%3c which  is  solid  is  subject  to  such  Casualties.  And  in  Houses %0a%3c the  Arches  are  most  safe,  and  the  Angles  of  Walls,  and %0a%3c those  Posts  which,  in  shaking,  will  jog  to  and  fro  every  Way. %0a%3c Walls  made  of  Brick  or  Earth  take  less  Harm  when  they  be %0a%3c shaken  in  an  Earthquake.  And  a  great  Difference  there  is %0a%3c in  the  Manner  of  Earthquakes  ;  for  the  Motion  is  after  many %0a%3c Sorts.  The  safest  is,  when  Houses  as  they  rock  keep  a  trem- %0a%3c bling and  warbling  Noise :  also  when  the  Earth  seemeth  to %0a%3c swell  up  in  rising :  and  again  to  settle  down  with  an  alterna- %0a%3c tive Motion.  It  is  harmless,  also,  when  Houses  run  on  End %0a%3c together  by  a  contrary  Stroke,  and  jut  one  against  another: %0a%3c for  the  one  Motion  doth  withstand  the  other.  The  bending %0a%3c downward  in  Manner  of  waving,  and  a  rolling  like  to  surging %0a%3c Billows,  is  that  which  is  so  dangerous  ;  or  when  the  whole %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  A  consideration  of  the  fact  here  expressed  might  have  mitigated  the %0a%3c wonder  felt  by  Pliny  at  the  prognostication  of  approaching  earthquakes, %0a%3c referred  to  in  chapter  Ixxix.

Martins  and  Sex.  Julius  were  Consuls)  a  mighty  Portent %0a%3c of  the  Earth :  for  two  Mountains  rushed  together,  and  with %0a%3c the  utmost  Clamour  assaulted  one  another,  and  then  retired %0a%3c again.  It  fell  out  in  the  Daytime  :  and  between  them  there %0a%3c issued  flaming  Fire  and  Smoke,  mounting  up  into  the  Sky : %0a%3c while  a  great  Number  of  Roman  Knights,  a  Multitude  of %0a%3c Servants,  and  Passers-by,  stood  and  beheld  it  from  the  Mml- %0a%3c lian  Way.  With  this  Conflict  all  the  Villages  upon  them %0a%3c were  dashed  in  Pieces  ;  and  very  much  Cattle  that  was %0a%3c within  died  therewith.  And  this  happened  the  Year  before %0a%3c the  social  War ;  which  I  doubt  whether  it  were  not  more %0a%3c pernicious  to  the  Land  of  Italy  than  the  Civil  Wars.  That  was %0a%3c no  less  wonderful  a  Prodigy,  which  was  known  also  in  our %0a%3c Age,  in  the  last  Year  of  Nero  the  Emperor  (as  we  have  shewn %0a%3c in  his  Acts),  when  Meadows  and  Olive-rows  (notwithstanding %0a%3c the  great  public  Road  lay  between)  passed  across  into  one %0a%3c another's  Place,  in  the  Marrucine  Territory,  within  the  Lands %0a%3c of  Vectius  Marcellus,  a  Roman  Knight,  Procurator  under %0a%3c Nero  in  his  Affairs. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXXIV. %0a%3c Wonders  of  Earthquakes. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE  happen  together  with  Earthquakes,  Inundations %0a%3c of  the  Sea ;  which  is  infused  into  the  Earth  with  the  same %0a%3c Wind,  or  else  received  into  the  hollow  Receptacle  as  it  set- %0a%3c tleth  down.

Neither  is  this  a  simple %0a%3c evil  Thing,  nor  doth  the  Danger  consist  only  in  the  Earth- %0a%3c quake itself,  but  that  which  it  portendeth  is  as  bad  or  worse. %0a%3c Never  did  the  City  of  Rome  experience  an  Earthquake,  but %0a%3c it  proved  a  Warning  of  some  unhappy  Event  to  follow. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXXV. %0a%3c In  what  Places  the  Seas  have  gone  back. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE  same  Cause  is  to  be  rendered  of  some  new  Piece  of %0a%3c Ground,  when  the  before-named  Wind  within  the  Earth, %0a%3c able  to  inflate  and  raise  the  Ground,  was  still  not  of  Power %0a%3c sufficient  to  break  forth  and  escape.

It  is  recorded,  also,  that  when  a  great  Multitude  of %0a%3c Fishes  floated  about  it,  those  Persons  died  presently  that %0a%3c fed  thereof.  So  they  report,  that  in  the  Campain  Gulf  the %0a%3c Pithecusae  Islands  appeared.  And  soon  after,  the  Mountain %0a%3c Epopos  in  them  (at  which  Time  there  suddenly  shone  out  a %0a%3c flaming  Fire  from  it)  was  laid  level  with  the  plain  Country. %0a%3c Within  the  same,  also,  there  was  a  Town  swallowed  up  by %0a%3c the  deep  Sea  ;  and  in  another  Earthquake  there  appeared  a %0a%3c standing  Pool :  but  in  another,  by  the  Fall  of  some  Moun- %0a%3c tains, there  grew  the  Island  Prochyta:  for  after  this  Manner, %0a%3c also,  Nature  hath  formed  Islands.  Thus,  she  disjoined  Sicily %0a%3c from  Italy,  Cyprus  from  Syria,  Euboea  from  Bceotia,  Ata- %0a%3c lante  and  Macris  from  Euboea,  Besbycus  from  Bithynia, %0a%3c Leucostia  from  the  Promontory  of  the  Syrenes1. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  LXXXIX. %0a%3c What  Islands  became  joined  to  the  Main. %0a%3c %0a%3c AGAIN,  she  hath  taken  Islands  from  the  Sea,  and  joined %0a%3c them  to  the  Main  Land ;  as,  for  Instance,  Antissa  to  Lesbos, %0a%3c Zephyria  to  Halicarnassus,  Aethusa  to  Myndus,  Dromiscos %0a%3c and  Pern£  to  Miletus,  and  Narthecusa  to  the  Promontory %0a%3c Parthenius.

In  other %0a%3c Places  there  be  also  Caves  possessing  a  prophetical  Power : %0a%3c by  the  Exhalation  of  which  Men  are  intoxicated,  and  so %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  The  nature  of  the  air  now  denominated  carbonic  acid  gas,  which, %0a%3c when  attempted  to  be  inhaled,  is  destructive  to  animal  life,  was  unknown, %0a%3c except  in  these  effects,  to  the  ancients.

Moreover,  in  Lydia,  the  Isles %0a%3c Calaminae  are  not  only  driven  to  and  fro  by  Winds,  but  also %0a%3c many  be  thrust  about  with  long  Poles,  which  Way  a  Man %0a%3c will :  a  Thing  that  saved  many  a  Man's  Life  in  the  War %0a%3c against  Mithridates.

Near  to  Harpasa,  a %0a%3c Town  in  Asia,  there  stands  a  craggy  and  awful  Rock,  movable %0a%3c with  one  Finger,  but  if  you  thrust  it  with  your  whole  Body, %0a%3c it  will  stiffly  resist2.

There  be  two  Mountains  near  the  River  Indus :  the %0a%3c Nature  of  the  one  is  to  hold  fast  all  Manner  of  Iron,  and  of %0a%3c the  other,  to  reject  it :  andr  therefore,  if  the  Sole  of  a  Man's %0a%3c Shoes  be  clouted  with  Nails,  in  the  one  of  them  a  Man  can- %0a%3c not pluck  away  his  Foot,  and  in  the  other  he  cannot  take %0a%3c any  footing.

The  Manner  thereof  is  various,  but  the  Cause %0a%3c is  in  the  Sun  and  Moon.  Between  two  Risings  of  the  Moon %0a%3c they  flow  twice  and  twice  go  back,  and  always  in  the  Space %0a%3c of  four-and- twenty  Hours.  And  first  as  she  riseth  aloft %0a%3c together  with  the  World,  the  Tides  swell ;  and  presently %0a%3c again,  as  she  goeth  from  the  Height  of  the  Meridian  Line %0a%3c and  inclineth  Westward,  they  subside  :  again,  as  she  moveth %0a%3c from  the  West,  under  our  Horizon,  and  approacheth  to  the %0a%3c Point  contrary  to  the  Meridian,  they  flow,  and  then  they  are %0a%3c received  back  into  the  Sea  until  she  rise  again :  and  never %0a%3c keepeth  the  Tide  the  same  Hour  that  it  did  the  Day  before  : %0a%3c for  it  giveth  Attendance  upon  the  Planet,  which  greedily %0a%3c draweth  with  it  the  Seas,  and  evermore  riseth  to  Day  in  some %0a%3c other  Place  than  it  did  yesterday.  Nevertheless,  the  Tides %0a%3c keep  just  the  same  Times  between,  and  hold  always  six %0a%3c Hours  a-piece  :  I  mean  not  of  every  Day  and  Night  or  Place %0a%3c indifferently,  but  only  the  Equinoctial.  For  in  regard  of %0a%3c Hours,  the  Tides  of  the  Sea  are  unequal :  forasmuch  as  by %0a%3c Day  and  Night  the  Tides  are  more  or  less  one  Time  than %0a%3c another  :  in  the  Equinoctial  only  they  are  equal  in  all  Places. %0a%3c A  powerful  Argument  this  is,  and  full  of  Light,  to  convince %0a%3c the  Dulness  of  those  who  are  of  opinion,  that  the  Planets %0a%3c being  under  the  Earth  lose  their  Power :  and  that  their %0a%3c Virtue  beginneth  when  they  are  above  only.  For  they  shew %0a%3c their  Effects  as  well  under  as  above  the  Earth,  as  well  as  the %0a%3c Earth  which  worketh  in  all  Parts.  And  plain  it  is,  that  the %0a%3c Moon  performeth  her  Operations  as  well  under  the  Earth  as %0a%3c when  we  see  her  visibly  above :  neither  is  her  Course  any %0a%3c other  beneath  than  above  our  Horizon.  But  yet  the  Altera- %0a%3c tion of  the  Moon  is  manifold,  and  first  every  seven  Days: %0a%3c for  while  she  is  new,  the  Tides  be  but  small,  until  the  first %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  \  33 %0a%3c %0a%3c Quarter :  and  as  she  groweth  bigger  they  flow  more,  so  that %0a%3c at  the  full  they  swell  most  of  all.  From  that  Time  they  be- %0a%3c come more  mild  :  and  in  the  first  Days  of  the  decrease  unto %0a%3c the  seventh,  the  Tides  are  equal.  Again,  when  she  is  divided %0a%3c on  the  other  Side  they  are  increased.  And  in  the  Conjunc- %0a%3c tion they  are  equal  to  the  Tides  of  the  full.  And  evidently %0a%3c it  appeareth,  that  when  she  is  Northerly  and  removed  far- %0a%3c ther from  the  Earth,  the  Tides  are  more  gentle  than  when %0a%3c she  is  gone  Southerly :  for  then  she  worketh  nearer  Hand, %0a%3c and  putteth  forth  her  full  Power.  Every  eight  Years,  also, %0a%3c and  after  the  hundredth  Revolution  of  the  Moon,  the  Seas %0a%3c return  to  the  Beginning  of  their  Motions,  and  to  the  like %0a%3c Increase  :  by  Reason  that  she  augmenteth  all  Things  by  the %0a%3c yearly  Course  of  the  Sun :  forasmuch  as  in  the  two  Equi- %0a%3c noctials they  always  swell  most,  yet  more  in  that  of  the %0a%3c Autumn  than  the  Spring  ;  but  nothing  to  speak  of  in  Mid- %0a%3c winter, and  less  at  Midsummer.  And  yet  these  Things  fall %0a%3c not  out  in  these  very  Instants  of  the  Times  which  I  have %0a%3c named,  but  some  few  Days  after ;  like  as  neither  in  the %0a%3c full  nor  in  the  change,  but  afterward  :  nor  yet  immediately %0a%3c as  the  Heaven  either  shevveth  us  the  Moon  in  her  rising,  or %0a%3c hideth  her  from  us  at  her  setting,  or  as  she  declineth  from  us %0a%3c in  the  middle  Climate,  but  later  almost  by  two  equinoctial %0a%3c Hours.  Forasmuch  as  the  Effect  of  all  Influences  in  the %0a%3c Heaven  reach  not  so  soon  unto  the  Earth,  as  the  Eyesight %0a%3c pierceth  up  to  the  Heaven  :  as  appeareth  by  Lightnings, %0a%3c Thunders,  and  Thunderbolts.  Moreover,  all  Tides  in  the %0a%3c main  Ocean  overspread  arid  cover  much  more  within  the  Land %0a%3c than  in  other  Seas :  either  because  in  the  whole  it  is  more %0a%3c violent  than  in  a  Part :  or  for  that  the  open  Greatness  thereof %0a%3c feeleth  more  effectually  the  Power  of  the  Planet,  working %0a%3c forcibly  as  it  doth  widely  at  Liberty,  than  when  the  same  is %0a%3c restrained  within  those  Straits.  Which  is  the  Cause  that %0a%3c neither  Lakes  nor  little  Rivers  ebb  and  flow  in  like  Manner. %0a%3c Pythias  of  Massiles  writeth,  that  above  Britain  the  Tide %0a%3c floweth  in  Height  eighty  Cubits.  But  the  more  inward  Seas %0a%3c are  shut  up  within  the  Lands,  as  in  a  Harbour.  Nevertheless, %0a%3c in  some  Places  a  more  spacious  Liberty  there  is  that  yieldeth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 134  History  of  Nature.  [ BOOK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c to  the  Power  [of  the  Moon]  :  for  there  are  many  Examples %0a%3c of  those  who,  in  a  calm  Sea,  without  Wind  and  Sail,  by  a %0a%3c strong  Current  only,  have  passed  from  Italy  to  Utica  in  three %0a%3c Days.  But  these  Motions  are  found  about  the  Shores  more %0a%3c than  in  the  deep  Sea;  just  as  in  our  Bodies  the  extreme %0a%3c Parts  have  a  greater  Feeling  of  the  Beating  of  Arteries,  or  in %0a%3c other  Words,  the  vital  Spirits.  Yet  notwithstanding  in  many %0a%3c Estuaries  of  the  Sea,  because  of  the  unequal  Risings  of  the %0a%3c Planets  in  every  Coast,  the  Tides  are  diverse,  and  disagreeing %0a%3c in  Time ;  but  not  in  their  Cause  ;  as  particularly  in  the  Syrtes. %0a%3c And  yet  some  there  be  that  have  a  peculiar  Nature  ;  as  the %0a%3c Firth  Taurominitanum,  which  ebbeth  and  floweth  oftener %0a%3c than  twice:  and  that  other  in  Eubcea,  called  likewise  Eu- %0a%3c npus,  which  hath  seven  Tides  forward  and  back  in  a  Day %0a%3c arid  Night.  And  the  same  Tide  three  Days  in  a  Month %0a%3c standeth  still,  namely,  in  the  seventh,  eighth,  and  ninth  Days %0a%3c of  the  Moon's  Age.  At  Gades1,  the  Fountain  near  the  Chapel %0a%3c of  Hercules  is  enclosed  about  like  a  Well,  which  sometimes %0a%3c riseth  and  falleth  with  the  Ocean  ;  and  at  other  Times  it %0a%3c doth  both  at  contrary  Seasons.  In  the  same  Place  there  is %0a%3c %0a%3c *  Cadiz,  on  the  Atlantic  coast  of  Spain,  was  founded  in  a  very  remote %0a%3c age  by  the  Phoenicians,  under  the  conduct  of  one  of  their  most  illustrious %0a%3c chiefs,  Melcartus ;  whose  name  is  significant  of  a  royal  race ;  and  who  has %0a%3c been  denominated  the  Tyrian  Hercules,  from  a  supposition  that  his %0a%3c labours  were  somewhat  similar  to  those  of  the  son  of  Alcmena.  The  city %0a%3c was  at  this  time  called  Gadira,  and  in  it  was  a  temple  devoted  to  this  first %0a%3c of  celebrated  navigators,  but  retaining  the  marks  of  primitive  purity  of %0a%3c worship,  in  having  no-  image.  (Silius  Italicus,  quoted  in  Cumberland's %0a%3c "  Sanchoniatho.")  The  Phoenicians  were  accustomed  to  select  for  their %0a%3c colonies  such  islands  as  this  Spanish  peninsula  then  was,  both  for  pru- %0a%3c dential and  religious  reasons ;  and  the  city  long  continued  the  centre  of %0a%3c trade  to  the  British  islands  and  northern  regions ;  while  at  the  same  time %0a%3c it  was  unknown  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  There  is  even  reason  to  believe, %0a%3c that  during  the  Roman  dominion  of  Europe  an  intercourse  was  main- %0a%3c tained between  Cadiz  and  the  independent  Britons  —  scarcely  known  to %0a%3c any  beside  the  merchants  engaged  in  it.  From  an  expression  of  Pliny  in %0a%3c chap,  cviii.  of  this  book,  it  would  appear  that  there  were  at  this  place  two %0a%3c pillars,  properly  termed  the  "Pillars  of  Hercules  :"  though  the  name  has %0a%3c since  been  applied  to  the  mountains  at  the  entrance  of  the  Mediterranean %0a%3c Sea.—  Wern.

Of  the  same  Nature %0a%3c there  is  one  Well  in  the  Town  Hispalis ;  while  the  Rest  be %0a%3c as  others  are.

And  hereupon  it  is, %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  "  I  was  not  so  curious  as  to  entitle  the  stars  upon  any  concern  of  his %0a%3c death,  yet  could  not  but  take  notice  that  he  died  when  the  moon  was  in %0a%3c motion  from  the  meridian  ;  at  which  time,  an  old  Italian,  long  ago,  would %0a%3c persuade  me  that  the  greatest  part  of  mankind  died :  but  herein  I  confess %0a%3c I  could  never  satisfy  my  curiosity,  although  from  the  time  of  tides  in  places %0a%3c upon  or  near  the  sea  there  may  be  considerable  deductions ;  and  Pliny  hath %0a%3c an  odd  and  remarkable  passage  concerning  the  death  of  men  and  animals %0a%3c upon  the  recess  or  ebb  of  the  sea.*1 — Sir  THOMAS  BROWN'S  Worhs,  by %0a%3c WILKIN,  vol.  iv.  p.  40. —  Wem.

Thus %0a%3c the  broad  and  spacious  Sea  hath  the  Taste  of  Salt  sodden  into %0a%3c it :  or  else  it  is  because,  when  the  sweet  and  thin  Substance %0a%3c is  drawn  out  of  it,  which  the  fiery  Power  of  the  Sun  very %0a%3c easily  draweth  up,  all  the  sharper  and  grosser  Parts  thereof %0a%3c %0a%3c which  was  believed  to  be  the  cause  of  the  tides  requires  no  further  re- %0a%3c mark, than  that  the  cause  and  effect  are  acknowledged,  and  that  the  mode %0a%3c of  influence  is  the  only  subject  of  error.  The  moon's  influence  in  causing %0a%3c shell-fish  and  vegetables  to  increase  and  decrease,  was  believed  by  Aris- %0a%3c totle, and  maintained  its  place  in  the  popular  opinion  until  a  late  date. %0a%3c But  in  tropical  countries  it  is  regarded  as  beyond  all  doubt,  that  the %0a%3c bright  shining  of  the  moon  has  a  deleterious  effect  on  all  bodies  exposed %0a%3c to  it ;  and  the  fact  is  implicitly  credited  by  many  Europeans  who  have  in- %0a%3c quired into  it.  Thus,  slaughtered  cattle  so  exposed,  are  believed  to  pass %0a%3c into  speedy  putrefaction ;  its  influence  on  eyes  when  asleep,  causes  blind- %0a%3c ness, and  on  the  head  a  tendency  to  delirium  or  death.  The  antiquity %0a%3c and  extent  of  these  opinions  appear  from  Psalm  cxxi. ;  where  the  writer %0a%3c expresses  his  trust,  that  "  the  sun  shall  not  smite  thee  by  day,  nor  the %0a%3c moon  by  night."  But  the  influence  is  not  always  hurtful :  at  least  on %0a%3c vegetation ;  for,  in  the  blessing  of  Moses  at  the  time  of  his  death,  on  the %0a%3c tribe  of  Joseph,  he  speaks  of"  the  precious  things  put  forth  by  the  moon" %0a%3c (Deut.  xxxiii.  14).  Dr.Prichard  ("Egyptian  Mythology,"  p.  156)  says: %0a%3c "  The  idea  that  the  moon  exerts  an  influence  favourable  to  propagation,  is %0a%3c so  strange  and  absurd,  that  we  are  at  a  loss  to  imagine  how  it  can  have %0a%3c arisen ;  and  it  is  truly  astonishing  to  find  that  similar  fictions  were  ex- %0a%3c tended through  a  great  part  of  the  Pagan  world.  Young  maids  among %0a%3c the  Greenlanders  are  afraid  to  stare  long  at  the  moon,  imagining  that  they %0a%3c incur  a  danger  of  becoming  pregnant."

And %0a%3c this  is  a  truer  Reason  of  that  unpleasant  Taste  it  hath,  than %0a%3c that  the  Sea  should  be  a  Sweat  issuing  out  of  the  Earth  con- %0a%3c tinually :  or,  because  overmuch  of  the  dry  Element  is  min- %0a%3c gled in  it  without  any  Vapour :  or  else  because  the  Nature %0a%3c of  the  Earth  infecteth  the  Waters  with  some  strong  Medi- %0a%3c cine. We  find  among  Examples  that  there  happened  a  Pro- %0a%3c digy to  Dionysius,  Tyrant  of  Sicily,  when  he  was  expelled %0a%3c from  his  Power,  which  was  :  that  the  Sea-water,  in  one  Day, %0a%3c in  the  Harbour  became  fresh. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  CI. %0a%3c Also,  of  the  Moons  Nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c ON  the  contrary,  they  say  that  the  Moon  is  a  Planet %0a%3c feminine,  tender  and  nightly;  that  it  dissolveth  Humours, %0a%3c drawing  the  same,  but  carrying  them  not  away.  And  this %0a%3c appeareth  evidently  because  that  the  Carcasses  of  wild  Beasts %0a%3c which  are  slain,  she  putrifieth  by  her  Influence,  if  she  shine %0a%3c upon  them.  When  Men  also  are  found  asleep,  the  dull %0a%3c Numbness  thereby  gathered  she  draweth  up  into  the  Head : %0a%3c she  thaweth  Ice,  and  with  a  moistening  Breath  relaxeth  all %0a%3c Things.  Thus  you  see  how  Nature's  turn  is  served,  and  is %0a%3c always  sufficient ;  while  some  Stars  thicken  the  Elements, %0a%3c and  others  again  resolve  the  same.  But  as  the  Sun  is  fed  by %0a%3c the  salt  Seas,  so  the  Moon  is  nourished  by  the  fresh  Waters. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  CII. %0a%3c Where  the  Sea  is  deepest. %0a%3c %0a%3c FABIANUS  saith,  that  the  Sea,  where  it  is  deepest,  ex- %0a%3c ceedeth  not  fifteen  Stadii.  Others  again  report,  that  in  Pon- %0a%3c tus  the  Sea  is  of  an  unmeasurable  Depth  over  against  the %0a%3c Nation  of  the  Coraxians,  at  the  Place  they  call  Bathea  Ponti, %0a%3c whereof  the  Bottom  could  never  be  sounded  at  the  Distance %0a%3c of  three  hundred  Stadii  from  the  Continent. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138  History  of  Nature.  [BooK  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAPTER  CIII. %0a%3c The  Wonders  of  Waters^  Fountains,  and  Rivers. %0a%3c %0a%3c OF  all  Wonders  this  is  among  the  greatest,  that  some %0a%3c fresh  Waters  close  by  the  Sea  spring  forth  as  out  of  Pipes  : %0a%3c for  the  Nature  of  the  Waters  also  ceaseth  not  from  mira- %0a%3c culous Properties.  Fresh  Waters  are  borne  on  the  Sea,  as %0a%3c being,  no  doubt,  the  lighter :  and,  therefore,  the  Sea-water %0a%3c (which  naturally  is  heavier)  beareth  up  whatsoever  is  brought %0a%3c into  it.  Also,  among  fresh  Waters,  some  there  be  that  float %0a%3c over  others.  As  in  the  Lake  Fucinus,  the  River  that  runneth %0a%3c into  it ;  in  Larius,  Addua ;  in  Verbanus,  Ticinus ;  in  Benacus, %0a%3c Mincius;  in  Sevinus,  Ollius ;  in  Lemanus,  the  River  Rho- %0a%3c danus.  As  for  this  River  beyond  the  Alps,  and  the  former  in %0a%3c Italy,  for  many  a  Mile  as  they  pass  they  carry  forth  their  own %0a%3c Waters  from  thence  as  Strangers,  and  none  other ;  and  the %0a%3c same  no  larger  than  they  brought  in  with  them  This  is %0a%3c reported  likewise  of  Orontes,  a  River  in  Syria,  and  of  many %0a%3c others.  Some  Rivers  again  there  be,  which,  upon  an  Hatred %0a%3c to  the  Sea,  run  under  the  Bottom  thereof;  as  Arethusa,  a %0a%3c Fountain  in  Syracuse  :  wherein  this  is  observed,  that  what- %0a%3c soever is  cast  into  it  cometh  up  again  at  the  River  Alpheus, %0a%3c which,  running  through  Olympia,  falleth  into  the  Sea-shore %0a%3c of  Peloponnesus.  There  go  under  the  Ground,  and  appear %0a%3c above  the  Ground  again,  Lycus  in  Asia,  Erasinus  in  Argolica, %0a%3c Tigris  in  Mesopotamia.  And  at  Athens,  the  Things  that  are %0a%3c immersed  in  the  Fountain  of  ^Esculapius  are  cast  up  again %0a%3c in  Phalericus.  Also  in  the  Atinate  Plains,  the  River  that %0a%3c becomes  buried  under  the  Earth  20,000  Paces  off,  appeareth %0a%3c again;  as  doth  Tirnavus  in  the  Territory  of  Aquileia.  In %0a%3c Asphaltites  (a  Lake  in  Judea  which  produceth  Bitumen)  no- %0a%3c thing will  sink  ;  nor  will  it  in  Arethusa,  in  the  greater  Ar- %0a%3c menia :  and  the  same,  though  it  be  full  of  Nitre,  produceth %0a%3c Fish.  In  the  Salentines'  Country  near  the  Town  Manduria %0a%3c there  is  a  Lake  full  to  the  Bank,  out  of  which,  if  there  be %0a%3c laden  as  much  Water  as  you  will,  it  decreaseth  not ;  nor  is  it %0a%3c augmented,  though  any  Quantity  be  poured  in.

Also  in  Surius,  a  River  of  Colchis,  the  like  is %0a%3c to  be  seen  :  insomuch  that  the  Bark  which  overgroweth  it  is %0a%3c as  hard  as  a  Stone.  Likewise  in  the  River  Silarus  beyond %0a%3c Surrentum,  not  Twigs  only  that  are  dipped  therein,  but %0a%3c Leaves  also,  grow  to  be  Stones ;  and  yet  the  Water  thereof %0a%3c otherwise  is  wholesome  to  be  drunk.  In  the  Outlet  of  the %0a%3c Reatin  Marsh,  a  Rock  groweth  bigger;  and  in  the  Red  Sea %0a%3c there  be  Olive-trees  and  other  Shrubs,  that  grow  up  green. %0a%3c There  be  also  very  many  Springs  which  have  a  wonderful %0a%3c Nature  for  their  boiling  Heat :  and  that  also  upon  the  very %0a%3c Mountains  of  the  Alps ;  and  in  the  Sea  between  Italy  and %0a%3c uEnaria :  as  in  the  Bay  Baianus,  and  the  River  Liris,  and %0a%3c many  others.  For  in  very  many  Places  you  may  draw  fresh %0a%3c Water  out  of  the  Sea ;  as  about  the  Islands  ChelidonisB  and %0a%3c Aradus  :  and  in  the  Ocean  about  Gades.  In  the  hot  Waters %0a%3c of  the  Patovans  there  grow  green  Herbs :  in  those  of  the %0a%3c Pisanes  there  breed  Frogs :  and  at  Vetulonii  in  Etruria,  not %0a%3c far  from  the  Sea,  Fishes  also  are  bred.  In  the  Territory %0a%3c Casinas  there  is  a  River  called  Scatebra,  which  is  cold,  and %0a%3c in  Summer  Time  more  abounding  in  Water  than  in  Winter  : %0a%3c in  it,  as  also  in  Stymphalis  of  Arcadia,  there  are  brought %0a%3c forth  River  Mussels.  In  Dodone,  the  Fountain  of  Jupiter %0a%3c being  exceedingly  chill,  quencheth  lighted  Torches  when %0a%3c dipped  therein  ;  but  if  you  hold  the  same  near  it  when  they %0a%3c nre  extinguished,  it  setteth  them  on  Fire  again.  The  same %0a%3c Spring  at  Noontide  evermore  wanteth  Water,  for  which %0a%3c Cause  they  call  it  Anapavomenos :  by  and  by  it  beginneth  to %0a%3c rise  until  it  be  Midnight,  and  then  it  hath  great  Abundance : %0a%3c and  from  that  Time  again  it  subsideth  by  little  and  little.  In %0a%3c Illyricum  there  is  a  cold  Spring,  over  which,  if  there  be %0a%3c spread  any  Clothes,  they  catch  Fire  and  burn.  The  Foun- %0a%3c tain of  Jupiter  Amman  in  the  Daytime  is  cold,  and  all  Night %0a%3c it  is  boiling  hot.  In  the  Troglodytes  Country  there  is  a %0a%3c Fountain  of  the  Sun,  called  the  Sweet  Spring,  which  about %0a%3c Noon  is  exceeding  cold ;  but  by  and  by  and  gradually  it %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 140  History  of  Nature.  [Boox  II. %0a%3c %0a%3c groweth  warm,  and  at  Midnight  it  is  offensive  for  Heat  and %0a%3c Bitterness.  The  Fountain  of  the  Po,  at  Noon  in  Summer, %0a%3c intermitteth  to  boil,  and  is  then  ever  dry.  In  the  Island %0a%3c Tenedos  there  is  a  Spring,  which,  after  the  Summer  Solstice, %0a%3c evermore  from  the  third  Hour  of  the  Night  to  the  sixth, %0a%3c doth  overflow.  And  in  the  Island  of  Delos,  the  Fountain %0a%3c Inopus  falleth  and  riseth  after  the  same  Sort  as  the  Nile %0a%3c doth,  and  together  with  it.  Over  against  the  River  Timavus %0a%3c there  is  a  little  Island  in  the  Sea,  having  hot  Springs,  which %0a%3c ebb  and  flow  in  Time  and  Manner  as  the  Tide  of  the  Sea. %0a%3c In  the  Territory  of  the  Pitinates,  beyond  the  Apennines,  the %0a%3c River  Novanus,  at  every  Midsummer  Time,  is  in  Flood  ;  but %0a%3c in  Midwinter  is  dry.  In  the  Faliscan  Country  the  Water  of %0a%3c the  River  Clitumnus  maketh  the  Cattle  white  that  drink  of %0a%3c it.  And  in  Boeotia,  the  River  Melas  maketh  Sheep  black  : %0a%3c Cephyssus  running  out  of  the  same  Lake,  causeth  them  to  be %0a%3c white :  and  Penius,  again,  giveth  them  a  black  Colour : %0a%3c but  Xanthus,  near  to  Ilium,  coloureth  them  reddish;  and %0a%3c hereupon  the  River  took  that  Name.  In  the  Land  of  Pon- %0a%3c tus  there  is  a  River  that  watereth  the  Plains  of  Astace,  upon %0a%3c which,  those  Mares  that  feed  give  black  Milk  for  the  Food %0a%3c of  that  Nation.  In  the  Reatin  Territory  there  is  a  Fountain %0a%3c called  Neminia,  which,  according  to  its  issuing  forth  out  of %0a%3c this  or  that  Place,  signifieth  the  Change  in  the  Price  of  Vic- %0a%3c tuals. In  the  Haven  of  Brundusium  there  is  a  Well  that %0a%3c yieldeth  to  Sailors  Water  which  will  never  corrupt.  The %0a%3c Water  of  Lincestis,  called  Acidula  (or  Sour),  maketh  Men %0a%3c drunken  no  less  than  Wine.  Also,  in  Paphlagonia,  and  in %0a%3c the  Territory  of  Gales.  Also  in  the  Isle  of  Andros  there  is  a %0a%3c Fountain  in  the  Temple  of  Father  Bacchus,  which  upon  the %0a%3c Nones  of  January  always  runneth  with  Water  that  tasteth %0a%3c like  Wine ;  as  Mulianus  verily  believeth  ;  who  was  a  Man %0a%3c that  had  been  thrice  Consul :  the  Name  of  the  Spring  is %0a%3c Dios  Tecnosia.  Near  Nonacris,  in  Arcadia,  is  the  River %0a%3c Styx  ;  differing  from  the  other  Styx  neither  in  Smell  nor %0a%3c Colour  :  drink  of  it  once,  and  it  is  present  Death.  Also,  in %0a%3c Berosus  (an  Hill  of  the  Tauri),  there  be  three  Fountains,  the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BOOK  1 1 .]  History  of  Nature.  \  4 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c Water  whereof  whosoever  drinketh  is  sure  to  die  of  it,  reme- %0a%3c diless, and  yet  without  Pain.  In  a  Country  of  Spain,  called %0a%3c Carrinensis,  two  Springs  run  near  together,  the  one  rejecting %0a%3c and  the  other  swallowing  up  all  Things.  In  the  same  Coun- %0a%3c try there  is  another  Water  which  sheweth  all  Fishes  within %0a%3c it  of  a  golden  Colour;  but  if  they  be  taken  out  of  that  Water, %0a%3c they  be  like  other  Fishes.  In  the  Cannensian  Territory, %0a%3c near  the  Lake  Larius,  there  is  a  large  Fountain,  which  every %0a%3c Hour  continually  swelleth  and  falleth  down  again.  In  the %0a%3c Island  Sidonia,  before  Lesbos,  there  is  a  hot  Fountain  that %0a%3c runneth  only  in  the  Spring.  The  Lake  Sinnaus,  in  Asia,  is %0a%3c infected  with  the  Wormwood  growing  about  it.  At  Colo- %0a%3c phon, in  the  Cave  of  Apollo  Clarius,  there  is  a  Channel  with %0a%3c Water:  they  that  drink  of  it  foretell  strange  Things  like %0a%3c Oracles  ;  but  they  live  the  shorter  Time  for  it.  Rivers  run- %0a%3c ning backward  even  our  Age  hath  seen  in  the  latter  Years  of %0a%3c the  Prince  Nero,  as  we  have  related  in  the  Acts  of  his  Life. %0a%3c Now,  that  all  Springs  are  colder  in  Summer  than  Winter, %0a%3c who  knoweth  not?  as  also  these  wondrous  Works  of  Nature, %0a%3c that  Brass  and  Lead  in  the  Lump  sink  down  in  Fluid,  but  if %0a%3c they  be  spread  out  into  thin  Plates  they  float :  and  let  the %0a%3c Weight  be  all  one,  yet  some  Things  settle  to  the  Bottom ;  and %0a%3c others,  again,  are  borne  above :  that  heavy  Burdens  be  re- %0a%3c moved with  more  Ease  in  Water.  Likewise  that  the  Stone %0a%3c Thyrreus,  however  large,  doth  swim  when  entire:  but  broken %0a%3c into  Pieces,  it  sinketh.  Bodies  newly  dead  fall  to  the  Bottom %0a%3c of  the  Water,  but  when  swollen  they  rise  again.  Empty  Ves- %0a%3c sels are  not  so  easily  drawn  out  of  the  Water  as  those  that  be %0a%3c full :  Rain-water  for  Salt-pits  is  more  profitable  than  any %0a%3c other  :  and  Salt  cannot  be  made  unless  fresh  Water  be  min- %0a%3c gled :  Sea-water  is  longer  before  it  freezes,  but  it  is  sooner %0a%3c made  hot.  In  Winter  the  Sea  is  hotter,  and  in  Autumn %0a%3c salter.  The  whole  Sea  is  made  still  with  oil :  and  therefore %0a%3c the  Divers  under  the  Water  scatter  it  with  their  Mouths,  be- %0a%3c cause it  allayeth  the  rough  Nature  thereof,  and  carrieth  a %0a%3c Light  with  it.  No  Snows  fall  where  the  Sea  is  deep.  And, %0a%3c whereas  all  Water  runneth  downward,  yet  Springs  leap  up; %0a%3c even  at  the  very  Foot  of  ^Etria,  which  burneth  so  far  as  that %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 142  History  of  Nature.

But  first,  out  of  Waters.  In %0a%3c a  City  of  Comagene,  named  Samosatis,  there  is  a  Pond %0a%3c yielding  forth  a  burning,  slimy  Mud  (called  Maltha2).  When %0a%3c it  meeteth  with  any  Thing  sqlid  it  sticketh  to  it ;  and  if  it  be %0a%3c touched  it  followeth  them  that  flee  from  it.  By  this  means %0a%3c the  Townsmen  defended  their  Walls  when  Lucullus  assaulted %0a%3c it ;  and  his  Soldiers  were  burned  in  their  own  Armour.  It %0a%3c burns  even  in  Water.

There  is  great %0a%3c Affinity  between  Fire  and  it ;  for  Fire  is  ready  to  leap  unto %0a%3c it  immediately,  if  it  be  near  it.  Thus  (they  say)  Medea %0a%3c burnt  her  Husband's  Concubine,  by  Reason  that  her  Crown %0a%3c anointed  therewith  was  caught  by  the  Fire  after  she  had %0a%3c approached  to  the  Altars  with  the  Intention  to  sacrifice3. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  Many  of  the  phenomena  here  related  are  merely  exaggerations  of %0a%3c the  truth ;  and  many,  however  strange,  are  easily  explained :  as  the  inter- %0a%3c mitting springs,  and  those  which  kindle  into  fire :  the  latter  owing  this  pro- %0a%3c perty either  to  the  extrication  of  hydrogen  gas  or  naphtha. — Wcrn.

For  in  Phaselis  the %0a%3c Mountain  Chimaera  likewise  burneth,  and  that  with  a  con- %0a%3c tinual Fire  both  Night  and  Day  :  Ctesias  of  Gnidos  writeth, %0a%3c that  the  Fire  thereof  is  inflamed  with  Water,  but  quenched %0a%3c with  Earth.  In  the  same  Lycia  the  Mountains  Hephaestii %0a%3c being  touched  with  a  flaming  Torch,  do  so  burn  that  the %0a%3c very  Stones  of  the  Rivers  and  the  Sand  in  the  Waters  are %0a%3c set  on  Fire ;  and  the  same  Fire  is  maintained  with  Rain. %0a%3c They  report  that  if  a  Man  make  a  Furrow  with  a  Staff  that %0a%3c is  set  on  Fire  by  them,  there  follow  Gutters  of  Fire.  In %0a%3c the  Bactrians'  Country,  the  Top  of  the  Cophantus  burneth %0a%3c by  Night.  Amongst  the  Medians,  also,  and  the  Caestian %0a%3c Nation,  the  same  Mountain  burneth  :  but  principally  in  the %0a%3c Confines  of  Persis.  At  Susis,  indeed,  in  a  Place  called  the %0a%3c White  Tower,  the  Fire  proceeds  out  of  fifteen  Chimneys,  and %0a%3c the  greatest  of  them,  even  in  the  Daytime,  carrieth  Fire. %0a%3c There  is  a  Plain  about  Babylonia1,  in  Manner  of  a  Fish-pond, %0a%3c which,  for  the  Quantity  of  an  Acre,  burneth  likewise.  Also, %0a%3c near  the  Mountain  Hesperius  in  Ethiopia,  the  Fields  in  the %0a%3c Night-time  shine  like  Stars.  The  like  is  to  be  seen  in  the %0a%3c Territory  of  the  Megapolitans,  although  the  Field  there %0a%3c be  pleasant  within,  and  not  burning  the  Boughs  of  the  thick %0a%3c Grove  above  it.

Zoroaster, %0a%3c if  not  the  author,  is  believed  to  have  been  the  great  reformer  of  this  doc- %0a%3c trine ;  which  by  some  is  supposed  to  have  had  its  origin  in  times  before %0a%3c the  Flood.—  Wern.

It  increaseth %0a%3c with  Showers  of  Rain,  and  casteth  out  Bitumen,  to  be  com- %0a%3c pared with  that  Fountain  or  Water  of  Styx  that  is  not  to  be %0a%3c tasted ;  otherwise  weaker  than  all  Bitumen  besides.  But %0a%3c who  would  wonder  at  these  Things  ?  In  the  Midst  of  the %0a%3c Sea,  Hiera,  one  of  the  ^Etolian  Islands  near  to  Italy,  burned %0a%3c together  with  the  Sea  for  certain  Days  together,  during %0a%3c the  Time  of  the  social  War,  until  a  Legation  of  the  Senate %0a%3c made  Expiation.  But  that  which  burneth  with  the  greatest %0a%3c Fire  is  a  Hill  of  the  Ethiopians  called  Theonochema ; %0a%3c which  sendeth  out  the  fiercest  Flames  in  the  hottest  Sun- %0a%3c shine.

What  a  Nature %0a%3c is  that  which  feedeth  the  most  greedy  Voracity  in  the  whole %0a%3c World  without  Loss  of  itself?  Add  thereto  the  infinite  Num- %0a%3c ber of  Stars,  the  immense  Sun  ;  moreover,  the  Fires  in  Men's %0a%3c Bodies,  and  those  that  are  inbred  in  Stones ;  the  Attrition, %0a%3c also,  of  certain  Woods  one  against  another ;  yea,  and  those %0a%3c within  Clouds,  the  Original  of  Lightnings.  Surely  it  ex- %0a%3c ceedeth  all  Miracles  that  any  one  Day  should  pass  in  which %0a%3c all  Things  are  not  set  on  Fire,  when  the  concave  Mirrors %0a%3c also,  set  opposite  to  the  Sunbeams,  set  Things  a-burning %0a%3c sooner  than  any  other  Fire.

In  Nymphaeum  there  cometh  a  Flame  out  of %0a%3c a  Rock,  which  is  set  a-burning  with  Rain.  There  is  the %0a%3c like  at  the  Waters  called  Scantiae.  But  this  is  but  feeble %0a%3c when  it  passeth,  neither  endureth  it  long  in  any  other  Mat- %0a%3c ter. There  is  an  Ash-tree  covering  this  fiery  Fountain,  which, %0a%3c notwithstanding,  is  always  green.  In  the  Territory  of  Mu- %0a%3c tina,  there  riseth  up  Fire  also,  upon  Days  devoted  to  Vulcan. %0a%3c It  is  found  written,  that  if  a  Coal  of  Fire  fall  upon  the  arable %0a%3c Fields  under  Aricia,  the  Soil  presently  is  on  Fire.  In  the %0a%3c Sabines  Territory,  as  also  in  that  of  the  Sidicines,  Stones %0a%3c anointed  will  be  set  on  Fire.  In  aTown  of  the  Salentines,  called %0a%3c Egnatia,  if  Wood  be  laid  upon  a  certain  hallowed  Stone  there, %0a%3c it  will  immediately  flame  out.  Upon  the  Altar  of  Juno %0a%3c Lacinia,  standing  in  the  open  Air,  the  Ashes  lie  immovable, %0a%3c blow  what  stormy  Winds  that  will  on  every  Side.  Besides, %0a%3c there  be  Fires  that  suddenly  arise,  both  in  Waters  and  even %0a%3c about  the  Bodies  of  Men.  Valerius  Antias  reporteth,  that %0a%3c the  Lake  Thrasymenus  once  burned  all  over  :  also,  that  when %0a%3c Servius  Tullius,  in  his  childhood,  lay  asleep,  a  Flame  shone %0a%3c out  of  his  Head  l :  likewise,  as  L.  Martins  made  an  Oration %0a%3c to  the  Army  after  the  two  Scipios  were  slain  in  Spain,  and %0a%3c exhorted  his  Soldiers  to  revenge  their  Death,  his  Head  was, %0a%3c in  like  Manner,  in  a  Flame.  More  of  this,  and  more  dis- %0a%3c tinctly, will  we  write  by-and-by.  For  now  we  exhibit  the %0a%3c Wonders  of  all  Things  intermingled  together.  But  my  Mind %0a%3c being  passed  beyond  the  Interpretation  of  Nature,  hasteneth %0a%3c to  lead,  as  it  were,  by  the  Hand,  the  Minds  of  the  Readers %0a%3c throughout  the  whole  World. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1  There  are  instances  in  modern,  as  well  as  in  ancient  times,  of  such %0a%3c luminous  appearances  proceeding  from  the  human  body :  most  commonly %0a%3c when  it  is  in  a  state  of  emaciation  or  chronic  disease.  Its  cause  is,  the %0a%3c excretion  of  phosphoric  vapour  mixed  with  the  perspiration.

But,  ac- %0a%3c cording to  Isidorus,  9818.  Artemidorus  addeth,  more- %0a%3c over, from  Gades  within  the  Circuit  of  the  sacred  Promon- %0a%3c tory to  the  Cape  Artabrum,  where  the  Front  of  Spain  beareth %0a%3c out  furthest,  in  Length  891  Miles.  This  Measure  runneth %0a%3c two  Ways.  From  the  River  Ganges  and  the  Mouth  thereof, %0a%3c where  it  dischargeth  itself  into  the  East  Ocean,  through %0a%3c India  and  Parthyene  to  Myriandrum,  a  City  of  Syria,  situ- %0a%3c ated upon  the  Gulf  of  Isa,  5215  Miles.  From  thence  by  the %0a%3c nearest  Voyage,  to  the  Island  Cyprus,  to  Patara  in  Lycia, %0a%3c Rhodes,  and  Astypatsea  (Islands  lying  in  the  Carpathian  Sea), %0a%3c to  Taenarus  in  Laconia,  Lilybseum  in  Sicily,  Calaris  in  Sar- %0a%3c dinia, 3450  Miles.  Then  to  Gades  1450  Miles.  Which %0a%3c Measures  being  put  together,  make,  from  the  said  Sea,  8578 %0a%3c Miles.  The  other  Way,  which  is  more  certain,  lieth  most %0a%3c open  by  Land,  from  Ganges  to  the  River  Euphrates,  5021 %0a%3c Miles.  From  thence  to  Mazaca,  in  Cappadocia,  244  Miles ; %0a%3c and  thence  through  Phrygia  and  Caria  to  Ephesus,  498  Miles. %0a%3c From  Ephesus,  through  the  ^Egean  Sea,  to  Delos,  200  Miles. %0a%3c Then  to  Isthmus,  212  Miles.  From  thence  by  Land,  arid  by %0a%3c the  Laconian  Sea  and  the  Gulf  of  Corinth,  to  PatraB  in %0a%3c Peloponnesus,  202J  Miles :  to  Leucas,  86J  Miles,  and  as %0a%3c much  to  Corcyra.  Then  to  Acroceraunia,  132£  Miles  :  to %0a%3c Brundusium,  86£  Miles :  so  to  Rome,  360  Miles.  Then  to %0a%3c the  Alps,  as  far  as  the  Village  of  Cincomagus,  518  Miles. %0a%3c Through  Gaul  to  the  Pyrenean  Mountains,  unto  Illiberis, %0a%3c 556  Miles ;  to  the  Ocean  and  Sea-coast  of  Spain,  332  Miles. %0a%3c Then  the  Passage  over  to  Gades,  1\  Miles.  Which  Measure, %0a%3c by  Artemidorus9  Estimation,  maketh  in  all  8685  Miles.

Whereby  it  appeareth  plainly,  how  much  of %0a%3c the  one  Side  the  Heat  of  Fire,  and  on  the  other  Side  frozen %0a%3c Water  hath  stolen  away.  For  I  am  not  of  opinion  that  the %0a%3c Earth  goeth  no  further  than  this ;  for  then  it  would  not  have %0a%3c the  Form  of  a  Globe  ;  but  that  the  Places  on  either  Side  be %0a%3c uninhabitable,  and  therefore  not  discovered.  This  Measure %0a%3c runneth  from  the  Shore  of  the  Ethiopian  Ocean,  where  now %0a%3c it  is  inhabited,  to  Meroe,  550  Miles.  From  thence  to %0a%3c Alexandria,  1240  Miles;  to  Rhodes,  583  Miles;  to  Gnidus, %0a%3c 84J  Miles;  to  Cos,  25  Miles;  to  Samus,  100  Miles;  to %0a%3c Chius,  84  Miles ;  to  Mitylen£,  65  Miles  ;  to  Tenedos,  28 %0a%3c Miles  ;  to  the  Promontory  Sigaeum,  12J  Miles  ;  to  the  Mouth %0a%3c of  Pontus,  312J  Miles;  to  Carambis,  the  Promontory,  350 %0a%3c Miles;  to  the  Mouth  of  Maeotis,  312J  Miles;  to  the  Haven %0a%3c of  Tanais,  265  Miles :  which  Voyage  may  be  made  shorter %0a%3c (with  the  Vantage  of  sailing  directly)  by  89  Miles.  From %0a%3c the  Haven  of  Tanais,  the  most  diligent  Authors  have  set %0a%3c down  no  Measure.  Artemidorus  was  of  opinion,  that  all  be- %0a%3c yond was  not  discovered,  allowing  that  about  Tanais  the %0a%3c Sarmatian  Nations  inhabit ;  who  lie  to  the  North.  Isidorus %0a%3c hath  added  hereto  1200  Miles,  as  far  as  to  Thule  :  which  is %0a%3c grounded  upon  bare  Conjecture.  I  understand  that  the  Bor- %0a%3c ders of  the  Sarmatians  are  known  to  have  no  less  an  Extent %0a%3c than  this  last-mentioned  cometh  to.  And  otherwise,  how %0a%3c much  must  it  be  that  would  contain  such  innumerable  Na- %0a%3c tions, shifting  their  Seats  every  now  and  then.  Whereby  I %0a%3c judge  that  the  Over-measure  of  the  Clime  inhabitable  is %0a%3c much  greater.  For  I  know  certainly,  that  from  Germany %0a%3c very  great  Islands  have  been  discovered  not  long  since.  And %0a%3c thus  much  of  the  Length  and  Breadth  of  the  Earth,  which %0a%3c I  thought  worth  the  writing.  Now  the  universal  Circuit %0a%3c thereof,  Eratosthenes,  who  was  learned  in  all  Kind  of  Lite- %0a%3c rature, and  in  this  Knowledge  better  qualified  than  others ; %0a%3c and  whom  I  see  of  all  Men  approved,  hath  set  down  to  be %0a%3c 252,000  Stadia.  This  Measure,  by  the  Romans'  reckoning, %0a%3c amounteth  to  31,500  Miles.  A  wondrous  bold  Attempt !  but %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 48  History  of  Nature.

This  Man  was  a  Melian,  famous  for  his  Skill  in %0a%3c Geometry :  he  died  very  aged  in  his  own  Country :  his  near %0a%3c Kinswomen,  who  were  his  Heirs,  solemnised  his  Funerals. %0a%3c These  Women,  as  they  came  some  few  Days  after  to  perform %0a%3c the  Obsequies  thereto  belonging,  are  said  to  have  found  in %0a%3c his  Monument  an  Epistle  of  this  Dionysodorus,  written  in  his %0a%3c own  Name,  To  them  above ;  to  this  Effect :  that  he  had  gone %0a%3c from  his  Sepulchre  to  the  Bottom  of  the  Earth,  and  that  it %0a%3c was  thither  42,000  Stadia.  Neither  wanted  there  Geome- %0a%3c tricians who  made  this  Interpretation,  that  this  Epistle  was %0a%3c sent  from  the  Centre  of  the  Earth ;  to  which  Place  down- %0a%3c ward from  the  uppermost,  the  Way  was  longest;  and  the %0a%3c same  was  just  half  the  Diameter  of  the  Ball :  whereupon %0a%3c followed  this  Computation,  that  they  pronounced  the  Circuit %0a%3c to  be  255,000  Stadia.  The  harmonical  Proportion  which %0a%3c forceth  this  Nature  of  Things  to  agree  unto  itself,  addeth %0a%3c unto  this  Measure  7000  Stadia,  and  maketh  the  Earth  to  be %0a%3c the  96,000th  Part  of  the  whole  World. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN  THE  THIRD   BOOK %0a%3c %0a%3c ARE    COMPREHENDED    THE %0a%3c %0a%3c REGIONS,  NATIONS,  SEAS,  TOWNS,  PORTS,  MOUNTAINS,  RIVERS, %0a%3c %0a%3c WITH  THEIR  MEASURES,  AND  PEOPLE,   EITHER  AT  THIS %0a%3c %0a%3c DAY  KNOWN,  OR  IN  TIMES  PAST  ; %0a%3c %0a%3c AS  FOLLOWETH  : %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1.
