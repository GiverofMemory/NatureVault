After reading Klaus Schwab's :Covid 19: The Great Reset", I wanted to know what their "Great Reset" was imagined to be.   Schwab had talked about "global governance". I hoped the "reset" would be described in this sequel,  "The Great Narrative For a Better Future".  But NO.  This book contains many lovely abstract words and phrases, but it contains NO narrative, and NO plan for how any of the ideas can actually be implemented.%0aWith all the wealth and power at the disposal of the World Economic Forum, it seems unbelievable that it can describe no real agenda or plan.  Are we to accept that the WEF is working for  "the world needs to be more resilient, more equitable and more stable" ( Forward ), with NO plan or agenda? (It appears that their idea for a "reset" may be one that they dare not describe.) The "narrative" of this book is basically that a Great Narrative is needed, to create a new future for humanity.%0a The book is divided into two parts: 1. Issues and Challenges. 2. Solutions.%0aPart 1 - rests on the assumption that humanity is in an "existential crisis" due to climate change, Covid, "exponential" technology growth....%0aPart 2 - consists of a grab-bag of some interesting "solutions" for the supposed "existential crisis"   (e.g. AI; China and the US must cooperate; global corporations must take responsibility for the environment...)  Any plan for how these "solutions" might be implemented  is absent.  Without a plan, these "solutions" are empty. %0aThe only plan that I can see is on p. 180:  "International business leaders must fully commit to sustainable development and address paramount global challenges, including climate change, the provision of public healthcare, energy conversation [sic], and the management of resources."  HOW to make business do this is not addressed.  Schwab  quotes Chandran Nair to make a point: "We can't deal with it through pious statements and market instruments, but with draconian rules. And those rules won't be provided by markets, but only by institutions of society, call it the state"  (p.156-7)  Schwab continues on page 157 with: "As the pandemic showed, acute crises contribute to strengthening the power of the state... the epidemiological crisis prompted a return to big government, which will not be reversed."  [Schwab seems to believe that he can decide this for the world.]   If nothing else, this book shows the absence of mind in one of the world's most powerful organizations - unless this is propaganda, hiding the plan.  We are not to be told what "The Great Reset" will look like, or where the WEF is trying to take us.  I wasted time reading this.
