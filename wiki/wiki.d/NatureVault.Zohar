Rabbi Shimon %0a> Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) put it all on paper %0a> and then hid it, as humanity was not %0a> ready for it. Today, we are ready for the %0a> revelation of The Book of Zohar. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi), %0a> author of The Book of Zohar (The Book of %0a> Radiance) was a Tana— a great sage in the early Common Era centuries. Rashbi's %0a> name is tied to numerous legends, and he is mentioned constantly in the Talmud %0a> and in the Midrash, the sacred Hebrew texts of his time. He lived in Sidon and %0a> in Meron, and established a seminary in the Western Galilee. %0a> %0a> Rashbi was born and raised in the Galilee (a mountainous region in %0a> today's Northern Israel). Even as a child, he was not like other children his age. %0a> Questions such as, "What is the purpose of my life?" "Who am I?" and "How is %0a> the world built?" plagued him and demanded answers. %0a> %0a> In those days, life in Galilee was very harsh: the Romans persecuted Jews %0a> and continually invented new laws to make their lives more difficult. Among %0a> these laws was a decree that prohibited Jews from studying the Torah (then %0a> synonymous with Kabbalah). %0a> %0a> 1 The articles, "About Rabbi Shimon Bar-^lbchai" and "About The Book of Zohar" are presented %0a> here courtesy of the paper Kabbalah Today. %0a> %0a> 7 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> A77A.1 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 711' 7^ |) W '21 • %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ( I %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 8 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> However, despite the Romans' prohibition, Rashbi immersed himself in the %0a> Kabbalah and tried to understand its subtle teachings. He felt that beneath the %0a> Biblical stories was a profound and hidden truth, which held the answers to his %0a> persistent questions. %0a> %0a> Gradually, Rabbi Shimon came to realize that he had to find a teacher %0a> who had already been through the spiritual path, gained experience, and could %0a> guide others up the spiritual ladder. He decided to join the group of the greatest %0a> Kabbalist of the time— Rabbi Akiva— a decision that turned out to be the turning %0a> point in Rashbi's life. %0a> %0a> STUDYING WITH RABBI AKIVA %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon was an avid, devoted student, burning with desire to discover %0a> the Higher realms of reality. Before long, he was one of Rabbi Akiva's prime %0a> students. He studied with Rabbi Akiva for thirteen years, and achieved the %0a> highest levels on the spiritual ladder. %0a> %0a> The Bar-Kokheva revolt abruptly ended the great days of Rabbi Akiva's %0a> seminary. Almost all of his 24,000 students died in plagues, and in fierce battles %0a> against the Romans. Of the 24,000 students, only five survived, and Rashbi was %0a> among them. %0a> %0a> Rashbi was among the leaders of the Bar-Kokheva revolt against the Roman %0a> rule in the land of Israel. His resistance became even more fierce and unyielding %0a> when he'd learned how his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, had been ruthlessly executed. %0a> %0a> The Talmud writes that once, when Rashbi spoke against the Roman rule, %0a> a fellow Jew heard him and alerted the Roman authorities. In consequence, %0a> Rashbi was tried in absentia and was sentenced to death. The Roman emperor %0a> sent men in search of him, but to their disappointment, Rashbi seemed to have %0a> vanished into thin air. %0a> %0a> THE CAVE AT PECTIN %0a> %0a> Legends have it that Rashbi and his son fled to the Galilee, hid in a cave at %0a> Peqi'in, a village in the north of Israel, and remained there for thirteen years. %0a> During that time, they delved in the secrets of the wisdom of the hidden. Their %0a> efforts succeeded, and they discovered the entire system of creation. %0a> %0a> After thirteen years in a cave, Rashbi heard that the Roman emperor had %0a> died. He could finally heave a sigh of relief. After leaving the cave, Rashbi %0a> gathered nine students and went with them to a small cave in Meron, known as %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Prologue %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 9 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Idra Raba (Great Assembly). With their help, he wrote The Book of Zohar, %0a> the most important book of Kabbalah. %0a> %0a> Baal HaSulam described Rashbi and his students as the only beings who %0a> achieved perfection, the 125 spiritual degrees that complete the correction %0a> of one's soul. When he finished his commentary on The Book of Zohar, Baal %0a> HaSulam held a festive meal to celebrate its completion. At that celebration, he %0a> stated that "...prior to the days of the Messiah, it is impossible to be awarded all %0a> 125 degrees... except the Rashbi and his contemporaries, meaning the authors %0a> of The Book of Zohar. They were awarded all 125 degrees in completeness, even %0a> though they lived prior to the days of the Messiah. Hence, we often find in %0a> The Zohar that there will not be a generation such as the Rashbi's until the %0a> generation of the Messiah King. This is why his composition made such a strong %0a> impression in the world, since the secrets of the Torah in it occupy the level of %0a> all 125 degrees. This is also why it is said in The Zohar that The Book of Zohar will %0a> not be revealed except at the end of days, meaning in the days of the Messiah." %0a> %0a> THE IDRA RABA (GREAT ASSEMBLY) AND THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a> %0a> Idra Raba is a cave located in the north of Israel, between Meron and Zephath. %0a> Rashbi took his students to this cave, and there he wrote The Book of Zohar. It is %0a> almost impossible to understand how great Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai really was. %0a> He belongs, as Baal HaSulam puts it, to the highest Inner Light. This is why he %0a> had to use Rabbi Abba to put his words into writing. In The Book of Zohar, the %0a> Rashbi tells his students: "I am arranging you as follows: Rabbi Abba will write, %0a> Rabbi Elazar, my son, will study orally, and the rest of the friends will converse %0a> in their hearts" (Zohar, Haazinu). %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar was written in the second century CE, not long after the %0a> ruin of the Second Temple and the beginning of the last exile of the people %0a> of Israel from its land. But even prior to the exile, Rashbi predicted that The %0a> Book of Zohar would only be revealed at the end of the exile. He stated that its %0a> appearance to the masses would symbolize the end of the spiritual exile: "...in it, %0a> they will come out of the exile with mercy" (Zohar, Naso). %0a> %0a> It is also written in The Book of Zohar that its wisdom would be revealed %0a> to all toward the end of the six thousand years, the period allotted to the %0a> correction of humanity: "And when it is near the days of the Messiah, even %0a> infants in the world are destined to find the secrets of the wisdom, and know %0a> in them the ends and the calculations of redemption, and at that time it will %0a> be revealed to all" (Zohar, VaYera). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 10 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE REINCARNATION OF A UNIQUE SOUL %0a> %0a> Rashbi is an incarnation of a unique soul, which coordinates and connects %0a> the Upper Force to every creation. This soul comes down into our world and %0a> incarnates in the patriarchs of Kabbalah. This is the order of its appearance: %0a> Abraham, Moses, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai, the ARI (Rabbi Isaac Luria), and %0a> Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). Each incarnation of this soul promotes %0a> humanity to a new spiritual degree and leaves its mark in Kabbalah books, which %0a> serve the generations that follow. %0a> %0a> An example of this process can be found in special sections of The Zohar %0a> called Raia Meheimna (The Loyal Shepherd). In these parts, Rashbi speaks from %0a> a state of clothing in Moses' soul. Another example of this is the book, Shaar %0a> HaGilgulim (Gate of Reincarnations), where Rashbi speaks from a state of clothing %0a> in the soul of the ARI. %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar is undoubtedly unique and one of the world's most %0a> renowned compositions. Since its writing, thousands of stories have been %0a> linked to The Zohar, and the book is still shrouded in mystery today. The %0a> fascination around it is so great that even though the book is completely %0a> incomprehensible to our generation without proper interpretation, millions %0a> of people diligently read it. %0a> %0a> RASHBI'S DEPARTURE %0a> %0a> According to tradition, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai passed away in the presence %0a> of his friends on Lag BaOmer (the 33 rd day of the Omer count, which starts on %0a> the first day of Passover) of the year 160 CE, and was buried in Meron. With his %0a> death, the soul of a giant Kabbalist completed its task in our world. %0a> %0a> Rashbi fulfilled his destination. Hundreds of thousands visit his gravesite %0a> yearly, trying to sense some of the Light that he had brought to the world. The %0a> greatest Kabbalists praise his composition and repeatedly claim that The Book of %0a> Zohar is destined to bring redemption to the world. %0a> %0a> Rav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, writes about the Zohar (Ohr %0a> Yakar): "This composition, called The Book of Zohar, is like Noah's Ark, where %0a> there were many kinds, but those kinds and families could not exist unless %0a> by entering the ark. ...Thus the righteous will enter the secret of the Light %0a> of this composition to persist, and thus is the virtue of the composition, %0a> that immediately when engaging, with his desire for the love of God, it %0a> will draw him as a magnet draws the iron. And he will enter it to save his %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Prologue %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 11 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> soul and spirit and his correction. And even if he is wicked, there is no fear %0a> should he enter." %0a> %0a> We are living in a historic time. The soul of Rashbi is completing its mission %0a> in our generation, and thanks to this spiritual giant, who lived nearly 2,000 %0a> years ago, the wisdom of Kabbalah is emerging so we may all ascend to a life of %0a> eternity and wholeness. %0a> %0a> ABOUT THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar is the most mysterious, and at the same time the most %0a> significant book of Kabbalah. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear %0a> that although The Book of Zohar was written eighteen centuries ago, it was %0a> actually written for our time. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) opened it %0a> to us and rekindled what has long been forgotten from our hearts. %0a> %0a> The depth of the wisdom in The Book of Zohar is locked behind a thousand doors. %0a> %0a> -Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), "Preface to the Book of Zohar" %0a> %0a> Since the dawn of humanity, unique individuals climbed the spiritual ladder %0a> and achieved the highest level of bonding with the Upper Force, the Creator. %0a> We call those people "Kabbalists." %0a> %0a> Through this bonding, they came to understand that the whole of reality, %0a> from the highest spiritual worlds down to our world, is founded on love and %0a> bestowal. They realized that there is nothing in the world except for this Force, %0a> and that everything that happens in reality was made only to bring humanity to %0a> permanent existence with this sensation. %0a> %0a> Kabbalists have searched and found the answers to every question they %0a> asked— the purpose of our lives, the structure of the world, and how we can %0a> determine our destiny. They wrote about what they discovered in books such as %0a> Raziel Hamalaach (The Angel Raziel), Sefer Yetzira (The Book of Creation), Etz Chaim %0a> (The Tree of Life), and others. %0a> %0a> Of all the books, the most seminal, mysterious, and profound is The Book %0a> of Zohar (The Book of Radiance). The Book of Zohar describes the hidden system %0a> of the Upper Guidance. It depicts the worlds, the great powers that govern %0a> them, and how one who chooses to study Kabbalah affects his or her own fate %0a> and that of humanity. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 12 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar also explains how every event cascades from the Upper World to %0a> ours, and the dressings it acquires here. But what makes The Zohar unique is the %0a> fact that it was not written for its contemporaries; it was rather intended for a %0a> generation that would live two millennia later— our generation. %0a> %0a> REMOVING THE COVERS %0a> %0a> Our generation stands at the very threshold of redemption, if we only know how to spread %0a> the wisdom of the hidden in the masses. %0a> %0a> -Baal HaSulam, "Messiah's Horn" %0a> %0a> The twentieth century has brought unprecedented changes. These opened the %0a> door to a whole new phase, which the greatest Kabbalists have been describing %0a> for centuries in their writings. The greatest change of all is that in this century, %0a> Kabbalists state that studying Kabbalah is not only permitted, it is a must! %0a> %0a> It is written in The Book of Zohar itself that the wisdom of Kabbalah would %0a> begin its spreading from the year 1840. The great 18 th century Kabbalist, The %0a> Vilna Gaon (GRA), wrote in his book Kol HaTor (Voice of the Turtledove) that the %0a> process of the revelation of the Kabbalah would begin in 1990. In his book, Even %0a> Shlemah (A Perfect and Just Weight), Chapter 11, he even stated that redemption %0a> depends primarily on the study of Kabbalah. %0a> %0a> Rav Kook explained that "the great spiritual questions that were once %0a> resolved only for the great and the excellent, must now be resolved to various %0a> degrees within the entire nation" (Eder HaYaker ve Ikvey HaTzon, p. 144). %0a> %0a> But it was Baal HaSulam who turned the words of the Kabbalists from %0a> a vision to a tangible reality. He clearly saw that the time had come to allow %0a> everyone to study The Book of Zohar. He claimed that by studying The Zohar, the %0a> whole of humanity would rise and attain the spiritual world. %0a> %0a> With this vision in mind, Baal HaSulam devoted himself to composing a %0a> comprehensive, accurate, and systematic interpretation of The Book of Zohar. %0a> His goal was to unveil the book to the public and make it suitable for the souls %0a> of our generation. %0a> %0a> In the introduction to his commentary on The Zohar, he explained why he %0a> wrote it: "I have named the commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) to indicate that %0a> the function of my commentary is as the function of any ladder. If you have %0a> an attic filled with abundance, you need only a ladder to climb it, and all the %0a> bounty in the world will be in your hands." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Prologue %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 13 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ACCELERATING THE SPREAD OF THE WISDOM %0a> %0a> All the Kabbalists dreamed of our generation, when the whole of humanity %0a> could discover the wondrous things they already had. They prayed that through %0a> reading the authentic sources they had left for us, we, too, would achieve %0a> bonding with the Upper Force, as did they. In his commentary on The Book of %0a> Zohar, Baal HaSulam threw us a rope, "a life buoy." In doing so, he paved our %0a> way to a future of abundance and prosperity. %0a> %0a> Baal HaSulam called upon us to give greater weight to engagement in the %0a> wisdom of Kabbalah, and accelerate the spreading of the wisdom. He knew %0a> that only the wisdom of Kabbalah could elevate the world to the spiritual %0a> realm and into the eternity that Kabbalists had been experiencing throughout %0a> the generations. %0a> %0a> Webster's Dictionary defines a generation as "a group of individuals born %0a> and living contemporaneously (at the same time)." In Kabbalah, however, a %0a> generation is a spiritual phase. According to great Kabbalists such as the Holy %0a> ARI, our generation— our spiritual phase— began in the sixteenth century. %0a> %0a> The longer we wait with the spiritual ascension our generation is meant to %0a> achieve, the greater will be our discomfort. The spiritual realm, which determines %0a> what happens in our world, will increase its pressure on us until we decide to %0a> achieve this realm for ourselves. %0a> %0a> In the words of the great Kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Azulai (in his %0a> introduction to the book, Ohr ha Chama (Light of the Sun)), "I have found it %0a> written that the above decree to not openly engage in the wisdom of truth was %0a> only for a time— until the end of the 1490. From then on ... the sentence has %0a> been lifted, and permission was given to engage in The Book of Zohar. And from %0a> the year 1540 it has become praiseworthy to engage in great numbers since it %0a> is by virtue of this the Messiah King will come, and not by another virtue. It is %0a> inappropriate to be negligent." %0a> %0a> "But the wise shall understand that their elevation comes from the Creator, %0a> the Tree of Life. And they who are righteous shall shine like the brightness of %0a> the firmament" (Daniel, 12:3). 2 %0a> %0a> "By virtue of Rabbi Shimon's composition, The Book of Zohar, from the %0a> Supernal Force that brings all things back to the Creator, at the end of days, the %0a> children of Israel will taste from the Tree of Life, which is The Book of Zohar; and %0a> they will be redeemed from exile by the Creator's mercy" (Naso, 90). %0a> %0a> 2 To facilitate comprehension of the spiritual meaning of ancient Hebrew sources, quotes are not %0a> direct translations, but rather reflect the Kabbalistic meaning of the texts. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Introduction %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar narrates that Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) and his son, %0a> Rabbi Aba, attained the level of Prophet Eliyahu (Elijah). Hence, it is said that %0a> Eliyahu himself visited their cave and taught them the Torah. (Incidentally, the %0a> cave in the village of Peqi'in still exists today.) %0a> %0a> The author of Divrey Yoel (The Words of Yoel) wrote the following in the book %0a> The Torah of Rashbi: "Before Rabbi Shimon studied the secrets of the Torah, %0a> there was a rule in the cave— to settle disputes according to the opinion of Rabbi %0a> Yehuda, the author of the Talmud. However, after Rabbi Shimon left the cave, %0a> everything that he had written in The Zohar was considered to have exceeded all %0a> human attainments." Rashbi himself received the name Butzina Kadisha (Holy %0a> Candle), as he had attained the soul of Moshe (Moses). %0a> %0a> Verdicts on legislative and procedural matters are rendered in accordance %0a> with the Talmud or The Book of Zohar, depending on where this matter is %0a> examined more strictly. If the matter is mentioned neither in the Talmud nor %0a> in The Zohar, then the decision is based on the source that best elucidates this %0a> matter. If the disputed matter is between the Talmud and the legislators, the %0a> decision is based on the assertion from The Book of Zohar. If the legislators %0a> themselves cannot come to an agreement on the matter in dispute, the decision %0a> is based on the opinion of The Zohar (Mishna Brura, 25, 42). %0a> %0a> The great follower of Rashbi, an heir (next receiver) to his soul, Rabbi Isaac %0a> Luria (The Holy ARI) wrote that his soul was a return of the soul of Rabbi %0a> Shimon, and the soul of Rabbi Shimon was a return of the soul of Moshe %0a> (Shaar HaGilgulim, item 64). He also wrote that the soul of Moshe clothed %0a> in Rashbi to correct the soul of Achiya HaShiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite), who %0a> "corrupted" Malchut on account of the sin of King Yerav'am (Jeroboam), which %0a> prompted the transgression of all Israel. Hence, the soul of Rashbi appeared %0a> %0a> 15 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 16 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to correct Israel's sins. The part of The Zohar titled Raya Meheimna (Loyal %0a> Shepherd) relates how Rashbi attained the soul of Moshe, merged with it, and %0a> attained the supernal wisdom. %0a> %0a> In his works Maranan ve Rahanan and Kli Yakar (Melachim, 2, 12), the great %0a> HaChida also says that Rashbi's entire work lay in correction of the sin of %0a> Achiya HaShiloni. %0a> %0a> As Rashbi says in the Talmud (Sukkah, 45, 2): "I can redeem the entire %0a> world from judgment from the day of my birth to the present day. And if my %0a> son is with me, from the day the world was created to the present day. And if %0a> Yotam Ben Uziyahu is with us, from the day the world was created to its end." %0a> The book of Melachim narrates about Yotam Ben Uziyahu (20, 15). %0a> %0a> After the verdict was lifted, Rashbi founded his seminary in the settlement %0a> of Tekoa and in the village of Meron. There he taught his disciples Kabbalah %0a> and wrote The Book of Zohar, thereby revealing what was forbidden to reveal from %0a> the time of Israel's reception of the Torah (Tikuney Zohar, Hakdamah, p. 17). %0a> %0a> However, to write down all the secrets of the Torah, Rabbi Shimon had %0a> to express them in a secret form. Rashbi's disciple, Rabbi Aba, had a unique %0a> quality to his soul. This quality enabled him to convey spiritual knowledge in %0a> a secret, concealed form. Hence, Rabbi Shimon asked his disciple to express %0a> his thoughts for him, that is, to commit Rashbi's thoughts to paper. The ARI %0a> explained it in the following way: "The Book of Zohar must remain concealed %0a> until the generation of the coming of the Mashiach (Messiah), as through the %0a> study of this book will humankind return from its spiritual exile" (The ARI, %0a> Shaar HaHakdamot, Hakdamah, p. 3). That is why Rabbi Aba wrote the teachings %0a> of Rabbi Shimon in Aramaic, as it is the reverse side of Hebrew. %0a> %0a> The ARI wrote (Maamarey Rashbi (Articles of Rashbi), p. 100) that the writing %0a> of The Zohar in a secret form was possible because the soul of Rabbi Aba %0a> originated from the Surrounding Light, and not from the Inner Light. For this %0a> reason, the ARI explained, he could express the most supernal wisdom in a %0a> secret form as simple stories. %0a> %0a> (Rabbi Shimon lived approximately to the age of eighty and passed away on %0a> the holiday of Lag BaOmer, the eighteenth day in the month lyar, surrounded by %0a> his disciples, and recognized by the entire nation. This day is celebrated as the %0a> holiday of Light. Rabbi Shimon's body was buried in a cave off Mount Meron, %0a> and the body of his son, Rabbi Elazar, is buried a few meters from him.) %0a> %0a> Like the subsequent compositions of the ARI and other Kabbalists (evidently, %0a> such is the lot of all true spiritual books), The Book of Zohar was concealed for %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Introduction %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 17 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> some 1,100 years in a cave near Meron, since the day it was written, until an %0a> Arab man found it and sold it in the market as wrapping cloth. %0a> %0a> Part of the torn sheets fell into the hands of a sage, who recognized and %0a> appreciated the value of the writings. After a long search, he recovered many %0a> sheets from refuse bins or bought them from spice vendors, who were selling %0a> their merchandise wrapped in the sheets of The Zohar. It was out of these %0a> recovered sheets that the book (as we know it today) was compiled. %0a> %0a> For many centuries, since that time until today, The Book of Zohar has been %0a> the subject of controversy. Philosophers, scientists, and other "sages," still %0a> debate it today. Yet, the fact remains that only a Kabbalist, one who ascends to a %0a> particular spiritual degree, attains what this book conveys. To all other people, it %0a> seems like a collection of narratives, stories, and ancient philosophy. Only those %0a> who do not comprehend this book argue over it; but Kabbalists know for certain %0a> that Rashbi's book is the greatest source of spiritual attainment that the Creator %0a> imparted upon the people in this world. %0a> %0a> Although The Book of Zohar was written in the second century, only Rabbi %0a> Yehuda Ashlag was able to provide a full commentary on it in the 1930s-40s. The %0a> reason for the concealment of The Zohar from the second century to thirteenth %0a> century and the lack of a complete commentary on it for eighteen centuries is %0a> explained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar." %0a> %0a> Rabbi Ashlag called his commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) because by %0a> studying it, one can ascend the spiritual degrees of attainment of the Upper %0a> Worlds as one would climb a ladder in our world. Following the publishing of %0a> the Sulam commentary, Rabbi Ashlag received the epithet Baal HaSulam (Owner %0a> of the Ladder), as it is customary among sages of the Torah to call a person not %0a> by his name, but according to his highest attainment. %0a> %0a> THE BOOK OF ZOHAR CONTAINS: %0a> %0a> 1. Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (The Introduction of the Book of Zohar)— containing %0a> several articles that fully reveal the inner meaning of the Torah. %0a> %0a> 2. Sefer HaZohar (The Book of Zohar)— divided into parts and chapters that %0a> correspond to the weekly portions of the Torah: %0a> %0a> The Book of Beresheet (Genesis): Beresheet, NoacK, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Chaiey %0a> Sarah, Toldot, Vayetze, Vayishlach, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Vayichi. %0a> %0a> The Book of Shemot (Exodus): Shemot, Vayera, Bo, Beshalach, Yitro, Mishpatim, %0a> Terumah (Safra de Tzniuta), Tetzaveh, Ki Tissa, Veyikahel, Pekudey. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 18 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Book of Vayikra (Leviticus): Vayikra, Tzav, Shmini, Tazria, Metzura, %0a> Acharey, Kedushim, Emor, BaHar, Vechukotay. %0a> %0a> The Book of Bamidbar (Numbers): Bamidbar, Naso (Idra Raba), Baalotcha, %0a> Shlach Lecha, Korach, Chukat, Balak, Pinchas, Matot. %0a> %0a> The Book of Devarim (Deuteronomy)'. VeEtchanen, Ekev, Shoftim, Titze, %0a> Vayelech, Haazinu (Idra Zuta). %0a> %0a> 3. Zohar Hadash (The New Zohar): additions to the weekly chapters: %0a> %0a> Beresheet, Noach, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Vayetze, Vayeshev, Bashalach, Yitro, %0a> Terumah, Ki Titze, Tzav, Acharey, BaHar, Naso, Chukat, Balak, Matot, VeEtchanen, %0a> Ki Titze, Ki Tavo. %0a> %0a> 4. Additional books in The Book of Zohar that are not a direct commentary %0a> on the Torah: %0a> %0a> Idra Raba, Idra Zuta, Safra de Tzniuta, Raza de Razin, Tosefta, Raya Mi'emna, %0a> Ashmatot, Sitrey Torah, Sitrey Otiot, and Tikuney Zohar. %0a> %0a> 5. Midrash HaNe'elam (The Commentary on the Writings): Song of Songs, Ruth, %0a> Eicha (Lamentations)— and on the Torah (Pentateuch). %0a> %0a> Baal HaSulam wrote the commentary on the portions of The Zohar that %0a> are known to us. His main commentaries in the "Introduction to the Book of %0a> Zohar" and the chapter "Beresheet" are expressed in terms of man's spiritual %0a> work. The most valuable articles of The Zohar for the science of Kabbalah are %0a> Idra Raba, Idra Zuta, and Safra de Tzniuta. All of them are expressed in the %0a> language of Kabbalah. Besides these articles, the rest of The Zohar is written in %0a> the language of Midrash. %0a> %0a> In its original form, The Book of Zohar— written by Rabbi Aba sixteen centuries %0a> ago— was not divided into weekly chapters. Its volume was several times larger %0a> than the text that reached us; it expounded not only the Torah, but also twenty- %0a> four other books of the Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings). %0a> %0a> Besides The Book of Zohar itself, Rabbi Shimon's book of Tikkunim (correc- %0a> tions) had reached us, as well. It comprises seventy commentaries on the first %0a> word of the Torah, Beresheet (in the beginning), since it includes everything. %0a> %0a> This book offers a semantic translation of The Zohar itself, Rabbi Yehuda %0a> Ashlag's The Sulam commentary, and my own explanations. The book also %0a> contains the first part of The Book of Zohar— Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (Introduction %0a> of The Book of Zohar). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Introduction %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 19 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> At the beginning of the text, the semantic translation is given in bold script. %0a> The Sulam commentary and my explanations are in regular script or italics %0a> because it turned out to be extremely difficult to separate my explanations %0a> from Rabbi Ashlag's holy texts. The numbers at the beginning of the items %0a> correspond to the numbers of the items in The Book of Zohar with The Sulam %0a> commentary, vol. 1. %0a> %0a> The reason for the interlacing of texts is the need to explain the meaning %0a> of The Zohar in several languages simultaneously: a) the language of Kabbalah %0a> (Sefirot, Partzufim, Gematria, and worlds), b) the language of spiritual work %0a> (emotions), c) the language of the Torah (narrative), and d) the language of the %0a> Talmud (judicial). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to returr %0a> the commentary. %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar, like the whole of the Torah, speaks exclusively of man %0a> (creation) and his relationship with the Creator. The Torah attaches worldly %0a> appellations to all of man's inner properties. Thus, the aspiration to the Creator %0a> is called "Israel," and the aspiration to selfish reception of pleasures is called %0a> lations of the world." However, there is no connection whatsoe\ %0a> %0a> vs and other nations in our work %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The book contains articles commented upon in the language of Kabbalah, %0a> and others commented upon in the language of emotions, which is easier to %0a> understand for the beginner. The reader can begin the study of the book with such %0a> articles as "Night of the Bride," and "Who rejoices on holidays." Nevertheless, %0a> a complete study of The Zohar entails systematic learning of the material. The %0a> more accustomed we are to Kabbalah, the more it permeates our hearts, and it %0a> can only be mastered by repeatedly reviewing the studied material. %0a> %0a> Rav Michael Laitman %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AA— Arich Anpin— the Partzuf of Hochma, the central, initial Partzuf in the world %0a> of Atzilut, from which all the other Partzuf im originate. %0a> %0a> Aba— Father —the Partzuf of Hochma. %0a> %0a> Ima— Mother— the Partzuf of Bina. %0a> %0a> ZA—Zeir Anpin— Son (with regard to AVI). %0a> %0a> ZON— ZA and ~Nukva— Malchut. %0a> %0a> Nukva, Malchut— a Se/ira (singular for Sefirot) or Partzuf that receives from all %0a> the preceding Partzufim (plural for Partzuf). Malchut of the world of Atzilut is the %0a> sum of all the creatures, all human souls. For this reason it is called Knesset Israel %0a> (The Assembly of Israel). %0a> %0a> Israel— the property of "bestowal," altruism. This is the property of the Creator, %0a> the property of Bina. Israel derives from the Hebrew words Yashar— straight, and %0a> El— the Creator. Thus, Israel is the property of aspiring to attain equivalence of %0a> form with the Creator. The "nations of the world" are the aspiration to selfish %0a> reception of pleasure. Naturally, these two properties are present in everyone, %0a> and Kabbalah is the method for the development of the property of Israel within %0a> man, with the purpose of attaining the Creator in this life. %0a> %0a> Kli (vessel) egoistic desires and aspirations are not considered a Kli. A Kli is the %0a> corrected desires, suitable for reception of Light. These are altruistic desires with %0a> a screen that has transformed them from egoism into altruism. %0a> %0a> The human heart that receives all sensations is called the Kli (vessel) of %0a> reception of sensations. The spiritual vessel, the only vessel that The Zohar speaks %0a> of, is the desire to bestow upon the Creator: to hand over all of man's desires to %0a> the Creator, as though saying that he agrees with all his heart to relinquish all of %0a> himself for His sake. Such a complete and true intention is called "Lishma" (for %0a> the Creator's sake). %0a> %0a> 21 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 22 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIROT %0a> %0a> %0a> THE CREATOR'S NAMES %0a> %0a> %0a> KETER %0a> %0a> %0a> EKYEhNAIeph-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> HOCHMA %0a> %0a> %0a> YAhN Yod-Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> BINA %0a> %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH with Nikud Elokim %0a> %0a> %0a> HESED %0a> %0a> %0a> EL=Aleph-Lamed %0a> %0a> %0a> GEVURA %0a> %0a> %0a> ELOKIM= Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> TIFFERET %0a> %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH with Nikud of Shvah-Holam-Kamatz %0a> %0a> %0a> NETZAH and HOD %0a> %0a> %0a> TZEVAOT %0a> %0a> %0a> YESOD %0a> %0a> %0a> SHADDAY=Shin-Dalet-Yod or EL=Aleph-Lamed CHAI=Chet-Yod %0a> %0a> %0a> MALCHUT %0a> %0a> %0a> ADNNAIeph-Dalet-Nun-Yod %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Mittuk (sweetening/mitigation) of a restriction law. Restriction is a ban for %0a> Malchut to receive Light. This ban is lifted when Malchut is corrected by the %0a> properties of Bina. %0a> %0a> Zivug— coupling— is translated as a sexual union between a man and a woman in %0a> this world. Since spiritual actions are absolutely detached from the way we would %0a> normally perceive them, I have chosen to use the Hebrew term Zivug, as it is more %0a> abstractedly perceived by people with no knowledge of Hebrew. This will help %0a> prevent confusions based on previously existing conceptions. The spiritual Zivug %0a> is an aspiration of the Upper One (ZA— male part) to pass the Light (pleasure) %0a> to the lower one (Malchut— female part). In doing so, both desires are completely %0a> selfless, as in the example of the guest and the host. %0a> %0a> PBP— Panirn be Panirn (face to face). This state occurs when a Zachar (male Sefira), %0a> or Aba (father), passes Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) to the female Sefira, or %0a> Ima (mother), for the subsequent transfer to the children (ZON). The same %0a> relationships of ABA (see below) and PBP also transpire between their children, %0a> ZON (ZA and Malchut). %0a> %0a> ABA - Achor be Achor, back to back (pronounced Ach be Ach). If Partzuf Aba %0a> (Hochma) has Ohr Hochma, but is unwilling to pass it on to Partzuf Ima (Bina), %0a> and if Ima also does not want to receive it, such a relationship between them is %0a> called back to back. The same relationship can exist between ZA and Malchut. %0a> %0a> Hesed— mercy, compassion, altruism, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy, %0a> compassion, and altruism). It appears only within a Kli (desire) that wishes to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 23 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> give selflessly and be similar to the Creator. This is the property of the Sefira or %0a> Partzuf of Bina. Bina of the world of AK (Adam Kadmon) is called SAG. Bina of %0a> the world of Atzilut is called Ima, the Supernal Mother, YESHSL/T, and AVI. %0a> The Light of Bina is the pleasure of being similar to the Creator's properties; %0a> hence, this Light (sensation) is the most reliable protection from the impure %0a> forces. And the Kli that possesses the properties of Bina is unable to transgress, %0a> as its desire is solely to bestow. %0a> %0a> KHB— Keter-Hochma-Bina (pronounced Kahab). These are the first three Sefirot %0a> that form the Rosh (head) of the Partzuf. The Rosh decides how much pleasure %0a> the Partzuf can accept not for its own sake but for the sake of the Creator. This %0a> Light descends from the Rosh to the Guf (body). %0a> %0a> HBD— Hochma-Bina-Daat (pronounced Habad). This is the same as Keter-Hochma- %0a> Bina (the Rosh of the Partzuf). Sefira Daat is not a Sefira, but the request (also %0a> known as MAN) of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva). Daat is the appeal of ZON to %0a> Bina regarding their desire to receive Ohr Hochma from her. This prayer of ZON %0a> is called MAN, for it ascends to Bina and evokes in Bina (Ima— their mother) the %0a> desire to bestow upon her children— ZON. MAN in Bina is called Sefira Daat. %0a> This is not a Sefira like the other ten Sefirot; it is rather a request. However, to %0a> stress this state, we use the name HBD instead of KHB. %0a> %0a> HQT— Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet (pronounced Hagat). These are the Sefirot of the Guf %0a> (body), similar to the Sefirot of the Rosh: Hesed is tantamount to Keter, Gevura is %0a> tantamount to Hochma, and Tifferet is tantamount to Bina. They are called GE %0a> (see below) of the body. %0a> %0a> NHYM— Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut (pronounced Nekim). These Sefirot receive %0a> from the Sefirot HGT (GE). Since they receive and have the will to receive, they %0a> are called AHP of the body. %0a> %0a> QE— Galgalta-Eynaim (skull and eyes). Sefirot Keter-Hochma-and GAR of Bina. %0a> These Sefirot do not have the will to receive and wish only to bestow. Hence, %0a> they cannot become egoistic. %0a> %0a> NRN— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama (pronounced Naran). This is the Light that fills the %0a> small Partzuf. Katnut (small state) is when the Partzuf has the strength (a screen) %0a> only to bestow, but is unable to receive for the Creator's sake, despite its desire %0a> to do so. In this case, the Partzuf has only Ohr Hassadim (Light of Mercy), but %0a> not Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom). This is why it is considered a small Partzuf, %0a> without strength and reason, similar to a child in our world. %0a> %0a> AHP— Awzen-Hotem-Peh (ear-nose-mouth), pronounced Ahap. These are Sefirot %0a> ZAT of Bina-ZA-Malchut, which possess a will to receive. Therefore, in the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 24 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> absence of a proper screen (resistance to that desire), they become egoistic. %0a> A Partzuf without a screen on its AHP is called Katan (small) and its state is %0a> called Katnut (smallness, incompleteness). It is like a child in our world, as this %0a> Partzuf, too, has no strength (screen), and can therefore have only Ohr Hassadim %0a> without Ohr Hochma). %0a> %0a> Qadlut— big state. A Partzuf with a screen (strength to resist its egoistic nature) %0a> to not only refrain from receiving for its own sake, but to receive not for its own %0a> sake (as in the example of the guest and the host. In this case, the Partzuf fills all %0a> of its desires (all ten Sefirot) with the Lights of Hassadim and Hochma. %0a> %0a> First Big State— Gadlut Aleph, the attainment of the Light of Neshama. %0a> %0a> Second Big State— Gadlut Bet, the attainment of the Light of Haya. %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma— Light of Wisdom. This Light fills the Kelim (vessels/ desires) of %0a> reception. It comes only if there is a screen on altruistic reception. %0a> %0a> Ateret Yesod— literarily "foreskin," the place of union between Israel and the %0a> Creator. After the second restriction, it is forbidden to make a Zivug (spiritual %0a> coupling) on Malchut herself due to the absence of the screen. However, a %0a> Zivug can be made on the properties that Malchut received from ZA, called %0a> Ateret Yesod. Just as the desires of Malchut herself are cut off, the foreskin is %0a> circumcised, and the desires that remain within her are those received from %0a> ZA, called Ateret Yesod. On these desires, Malchut can make a Zivug with ZA, %0a> and receive the Light of Hochma. Naturally, this is not the same Light of %0a> Hochma that Malchut would receive if she were able to make a Zivug on her %0a> desires, that is, on herself, on her own properties, called "the central point of %0a> creation," the truly egoistic desires. Malchut will be able to do that only after %0a> 6,000 years, at the end of correction. But before that happens, these desires %0a> are called the mark of union with the Creator, since a Zivug on Ateret Yesod %0a> brings her closer to the Creator. %0a> %0a> Ateret Yesod 1 is also Malchut de Malchut that remains after the circumcision, %0a> the removal of the Orla (foreskin). This is the corrected part of Malchut, her %0a> unification with Sefira Yesod, upon which a Zivug can be made while still during %0a> the 6,000 years, thus bringing Malchut to the end of correction. %0a> %0a> NRNHY— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama-Haya-Yechida (pronounced Naranhay). This %0a> Light fills the big Partzuf, consisting of GE and AHP. %0a> %0a> Ohr (Light)— pleasure, the sensation of the Creator. Ohr should always be inter- %0a> preted as the same concept, for although the term is used in general, all of its %0a> synonyms are implied! %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 25 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kli (vessel)— desire, creature. Like Ohr, the word Kli is used in general, but all of %0a> its synonyms are implied! %0a> %0a> Qematria— numerical value of a letter, or a combination of letters and words. %0a> This is a special way of recording spiritual information. %0a> %0a> Parsa— firmament, the division between the world of Atzilut and the worlds %0a> BYA. The Parsa divides the ten Sefirot into two parts: the altruistic Kelim of %0a> bestowal (GAR, KHB, and GE) and the Kelim of reception (ZON or Bina-ZA- %0a> Malchut), for Bina deliberately fell into ZA (AHP) with the purpose of correcting %0a> him. Malchut, which ascends above Bina and stands below Hochma, is called %0a> Parsa or "firmament," and separates GE from AHP. %0a> %0a> ZAT, ZAK— the seven Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Net^ah, Hod, Yesod, Malchut %0a> (HGTNHYM). %0a> %0a> VAT, VAK— the six Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod (HGT NHY, %0a> pronounced Hagat Nehy). %0a> %0a> De - the preposition 'of in a possessive meaning. For example, Malchut de %0a> Atzilut means Malchut of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> English translation— Whenever it says so in parenthesis, this refers to the %0a> books of the Torah (Pentateuch), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings/ %0a> Hagiographa), published by Mosad HaRav Kook, in Hebrew with English %0a> translation. For example, (Yeshayahu, 11:9; English translation p. XXX, 9) means %0a> that if you open page XXX in the book of Prophets, what you are looking for %0a> will be in sentence number nine. When the original source is indicated, it is %0a> recommended to refer to it there and then to read at least the passage that the %0a> quoted saying is ascribed to. This will help you to see even more clearly that the %0a> Torah, using an allegorical, figurative language, speaks only of the spiritual world %0a> and man's ascension to it, and not at all about history or about our world. %0a> %0a> Garments— attributes, desires, Kelim. Generally, the garments in question are %0a> those that Malchut receives from Bina. %0a> %0a> Huppah—a wedding baldachin, a canopy under which a marriage ceremony %0a> takes place. %0a> %0a> Nartik— the covering of ZA; same as the Huppah. %0a> %0a> Adornments— the Light of Hassadim, Light of Bina, which she passes into %0a> Malchut. This corrects Malchut, and enables her to receive the Light of Hochma %0a> in the Light of Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Orla— foreskin on the Sefira Yesod, the place of the Zivug between ZA and Malchut. %0a> The Orla must be removed, for during the 6,000 years, it is impossible to make %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 26 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> a Zivug (intention) on Malchut herself and receive for the Creator's sake. Only a %0a> Zivug on the union of Malchut with ZA can be made. This is called Ateret Yesod, %0a> the part of the Sefira Yesod that remains after the cutting off of the Orla. Orla is %0a> also Malchut de Malchut, or the impure forces. %0a> %0a> Ima— Mother— Bina with regard to Malchut, who is the daughter. %0a> %0a> Daughter— Malchut with regard to Bina, mother. %0a> %0a> Kodesh ha Kodas him— Holy of Holies— the Light of GAR— Neshama-Ha^a-Yechida. %0a> Question— the sensation of lack of the Light of Hochma in Malchut. %0a> Sela— rock or truth. The name of Malchut. %0a> %0a> Shechina— Divinity— the sensation (appearance, vision) of the Creator to those %0a> who attain Him. Malchut in the state of reception of the Light (the Creator) is %0a> called Shechina. The sensation of the Creator, the place where one experiences %0a> the Creator is called Shechina. %0a> %0a> Techum— zone— the distance beyond the bounds of which one is forbidden to %0a> go on Shabbat (the Sabbath). Techum Shahhat constitutes the maximal distance %0a> within which one can move about during Sabbath. %0a> %0a> Sigim— dross— impure desires that exist within pure desires. Man's work is to %0a> separate the two, and to gradually correct the Sigim. The term Sigim comes from %0a> SAG, for they appeared as a result of the breaking of the Kelim of the world of %0a> Nelcudim, which refer to the system of the Partzufim of Partzuf SAG. The term %0a> Sigim found its way from Kabbalah into spoken Hebrew. %0a> %0a> SHACH-Shin-Cha/-300 + 20 = 320 fragments of the broken vessel. %0a> %0a> RAPACH-Reish-Peh-Chet-200 + 80 + 8 = 288 fragments of the broken vessel, %0a> which one can and must be corrected during the 6,000 years, by climbing the %0a> 6,000 steps of the spiritual ladder. %0a> %0a> Lev ha Even— Stony Heart— Lev = Lamed-Bet = 30 + 2 = 32 fragments into which %0a> Malchut had broken. These fragments of Malchut cannot be corrected and made %0a> altruistic; one can only refrain from using these desires. Lev ha Even is corrected %0a> only after the 6,000 years, that is, after the Creator Himself corrects the 288 %0a> fragments within man. It becomes completely altruistic and receives the name %0a> Lev Basar (heart of flesh). %0a> %0a> Lo Lis hma— not for the sake of the Creator. Since nothing exists in creation but %0a> the Creator and man, if something is not done "for the sake of the Creator," it is %0a> done "for one's own sake." Thus, Lo Lishma denotes man's egoistic intention. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 27 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Lishma— for the Creator's sake. Man's selfless intention to act only to please %0a> and bring joy to the Creator. %0a> %0a> Four angels that participate in the creation of man— the four basic properties %0a> of nature: mercy— Hesed, justice— Tzedek, truth— Emet, and peace— Shalom. %0a> %0a> Eretz Israel— Land of Israel— Yetzira of this world.

Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, "It is written, as a rose among thorns." That a rose is %0a> the Assembly of Israel. Because there is a rose and there is a rose, just as a rose %0a> among thorns is tinged with red and white, the Assembly of Israel consists of %0a> judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel %0a> is surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of mercy. However, Elokim, %0a> that is here, thought to bring out the thirteen words that surround the Assembly %0a> of Israel and guard it. %0a> %0a> 2. Afterwards, this is mentioned another time. The reason it is mentioned %0a> another time is to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround the rose. And %0a> these five stand for salvation. These are also the five gates. %0a> %0a> It is written of this secret, "I will raise the cup of salvation, it is the cup %0a> of blessing." The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, and no more, just %0a> as a rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this %0a> rose is the cup of blessing. From the second to the third mention of the name %0a> Elokim, there are five words. From here on, the Light was created and concealed, %0a> enclosed within that covenant, and entered the rose and fructified it. And this is %0a> referred to as a fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed thereof. And this seed truly %0a> exists in the letter of the covenant. %0a> %0a> 3. And just as the form of the covenant is sown in forty-two conceptions from %0a> that seed, so is the legislative, special name of creation sown. %0a> %0a> 4. In the beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, the flower buds appeared on the %0a> earth. "The flower buds" refer to the act of creation. They appeared on the %0a> earth when, on the third day, as it is said, "And the earth shall pullulate." %0a> That was when they appeared on the earth. The time of singing has come, and %0a> this is the fourth day, when there was a reduction from the Light of Hassadim. %0a> The voice of the turtle dove refers to the fifth day, where it is written, "Let the %0a> waters swarm," so as to produce offspring. "It is heard" refers to the sixth day, %0a> where it is written, "Let us stand and create man," and there it is said, "We %0a> will do and we will hear." "In our land" refers to the day of Shabbat, which %0a> represents the Land of Life. %0a> %0a> 5. Another meaning is that these flower buds are the Patriarchs who entered the %0a> thoughts of the future world, and there they are concealed. They emerged from %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 3 The translation in the book is semantic and not literal %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 37 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> there in concealment, and concealed themselves in the true prophets. Yosef was %0a> born and they concealed themselves in him. When Yosef entered the Holy Land %0a> and founded them there, they appeared in the land (earth) and were revealed %0a> there. When are they seen? When a rainbow is seen in the world. It is when the %0a> rainbow is seen that they are revealed. As the time of pruning has come. The %0a> time has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked %0a> saved? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not %0a> be seen, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not %0a> be able to exist. %0a> %0a> 6. Who animates the world and causes the Fathers to appear? It is the voice of %0a> the children, who study the Torah, meaning that these children of the world %0a> save the world. In deference to them, "We will make you pendants of gold." %0a> Those are the children, children of the world, as is it said, "You shall make two %0a> Cherubs of gold." %0a> %0a> 7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes above and see who %0a> has created this." Raise your eyes. To what place? To the place where all eyes %0a> depend on Him. And who is He? He is one who opens eyes. And you will know %0a> this. It is the concealed Atik, wherein lies the question, who has created this. %0a> And who is He? MI = who. He is called from the edge of Divine Heaven, where %0a> everything belongs to Him. As there is a question, He is along a concealed path, %0a> and does not reveal Himself. He is called MI, as there is no question Above, this %0a> edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a> %0a> 8. And there is another below, called MA. What is between this and that? The %0a> first one, called MI, is concealed. There is a question in him, because man asks, %0a> searches and looks, and beholds from degree to degree until the end of all the %0a> degrees. And after he arrives there, he is asked: MA? (What?). What have you %0a> learned? What have you seen? What have you investigated, since everything is %0a> still concealed, just as it was before. %0a> %0a> 9. It is written of this secret, "Who can I point out to you? Who can I compare %0a> you to?" After all, the Temple was destroyed, and a voice came forth and said, %0a> "What can I point out to you, and what can I compare you to?" The word MA = %0a> what, testimony, each day and the day of testimony to you from the days of past, %0a> as it is written: "I call to witness Heaven and earth," which is like unto you. %0a> %0a> According to the same type, "I adorned you with holy ornaments," made %0a> you ruler over the world, as it is written: "Is this the city that was called the %0a> quintessence of beauty?" and so forth. I have called you, "Jerusalem, a city built %0a> by me." "What could be compared to you?" Just as you sit, so he is like Above, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 38 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> just as now the holy nation does not enter into you to perform holy work, so %0a> I swear to you that I will not enter Above until I dwell down below. This is %0a> your consolation, as this degree is equal to you in all things. And now that I %0a> am here, "Your misery is great, like the sea." And if you claim that there is no %0a> existence or remedy for you, then MI (who) shall heal you? It shall be precisely %0a> that concealed Supernal Degree, which animates all things; it shall heal you, %0a> and exist within you. %0a> %0a> 10. MI is the upper edge of Heaven, MA is the lower edge of Heaven. This was %0a> inherited by Yaakov, that he shines from edge to edge, from the first edge, which %0a> is MI, until the last edge, which is MA, for he stands in the middle. Therefore, %0a> who has created this? %0a> %0a> 11. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, my son, stop talking and reveal to us the supernal %0a> secret, which the people of the world know nothing of. Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a> Rabbi Shimon wept and said: One minute. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, what %0a> is ELEH (these)? If you say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, have they not %0a> always been seen? However, MA (what) were created, as it is said, by the word of %0a> the Creator were the Heavens made. If it is about concealed things, then it is not %0a> written ELEH, because they are revealed. %0a> %0a> 12. But this secret was never revealed, until one day when I was at the seashore, %0a> Eliyahu came and told me: "Rabbi, do you know what this is, WHO HAS %0a> CREATED THIS?" I told him: "These are the Heavens and their hosts, the %0a> works of the Creator, that man can look at them and bless them, as is written, %0a> 'When I behold Your Heavens, the work of Your hands, our Master, how glorious %0a> Your name is throughout all the earth'!" %0a> %0a> 13. He told me: "Rabbi, there was one thing concealed before the Creator, %0a> which He revealed to the Supernal Assembly, and it is this. When the concealed %0a> of all the concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made one single point, %0a> and this point ascended and became a Thought. With it, He drew all the forms %0a> and with it engraved all the images." %0a> %0a> 14. He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed %0a> image of the holy of holies. A profound structure emerged from the depth of %0a> that thought, and it is called MI - who, which is the inception of the structure %0a> both standing and not standing, which is hidden deep inside the name. It is not %0a> called, but only MI - who. He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this %0a> name, so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment and created ELEH, %0a> and ELEH ascended in name. These letters combined with these, and the name %0a> Elokim was completed. And until He created ELEH - this, Elokim did not ascend %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 39 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to form the name Elokim. And these sinned in worshipping the golden calf. Of %0a> this secret it is said, ELEH is your Lord, Israel. %0a> %0a> 15. Just as the letters MI joined the letters ELEH, so does this name remain %0a> forever united, and on this secret stands the world. Eliyahu then flew away, and %0a> I could not see him. It is from him that I knew this, which stands on the secret, %0a> and its explanation. Rabbi Elazar has come, and all the disciples, too, and they %0a> bowed down before him, wept and said, if we had (not) come into this world but %0a> only to hear this secret, it would have been enough. %0a> %0a> 16. Rabbi Shimon said, "Onto these Heavens and their hosts were created in %0a> MA, as it is said, 'When I behold the Heavens, the works of Your hands,' and it %0a> is said, 'MA, how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth, which You set %0a> Above the Heavens, it ascends in name.' That is why it created Light for Light, %0a> clothed this into this, and elevated in the Supernal Name, this the Creator %0a> created in the beginning. This is the Supernal Creator, for MA is not such and %0a> was not created." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened (began): "It is said, as a rose among thorns" (Shir %0a> HaShirim, 2:2). He asks, "What does a rose represent?" He answers, "It is the %0a> Assembly of Israel, meaning Malchut. For there is a rose, and there is a rose. %0a> Just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red and white, so does the Assembly %0a> of Israel (Malchut) consist of judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen %0a> petals, so the Assembly of Israel consists of thirteen properties of mercy, %0a> surrounding it on all sides. After all, Elokim (the name of the Creator that %0a> alludes to His attitude towards the lower ones by the force of judgment), as %0a> it is said, 'In the beginning, Elokim created' (the first sentence in the Torah), %0a> In the beginning (initially) when He thought it, He created thirteen words to %0a> surround the Assembly of Israel and to protect it, and here they are: THE, %0a> HEAVEN, ANDTHE, EARTH, ANDTHE EARTH, WAS, EMPTY, AND- %0a> CHAOTIC, ANDTHE DARKNESS, OVER, THE FACE, OF THE ABYSS, %0a> ANDTHE SPIRIT, up to the word Elokim" (In Hebrew, "and" is written in %0a> conjunction with the word following it. Hence, it is considered as one word). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> its object of study, Kabbalah takes the only creation, the only thing that %0a> %0a> creaks %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As its %0a> %0a> exists besides the Creator— man's self, or "I," and researches it. This science br %0a> down the self into parts, explains the structure and properties of each part, and %0a> the purpose of its creation. Kabbalah explains how every part of man's self, called %0a> "the soul," can be changed so that one would reach the goal of creation, the state %0a> desired by both the Creator and man himself, provided he realizes it. %0a> %0a> There is not a science in the world that can describe, either graphically or %0a> nalytically, through use of formulas, our sensations and desires, and how diverse %0a> nd multifaceted they are. That is how fickle, unpredictable, and absolutely %0a> listinct they are in everyone. This is because our desires surface in our mind %0a> nd sensations in a gradual order, in a certain sequence, so we may acknowledge %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 41 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 42 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> is our essence, the only thing that characterizes an indi\ %0a> ging, and what remains is merely an external, ar %0a> hy it is said that every moment man is born anew. Yet, if thi; %0a> )Uid we regard one another, and how should we perceive ourselves? How %0a> possibly "stabilize" anything within and outside of us if we are constantly %0a> >ing, and all that we perceive is a function of our inner state? %0a> %0a> The Creator is the source of Light (pleasure). Those who draw near Him %0a> sense Him as such. Such people, who draw near the Creator and thereby sense %0a> Him, are called Kabbalists (from the word Lekabel— to receive the Creator's %0a> Light). One can draw near the Creator only through equivalence of desires. %0a> ;ator is incorporeal, and can only be sensed with our heart. Naturall 1 %0a> leant by "heart" is not the pump that mobilizes blood through our vei %0a> ter of man's every sensation. %0a> %0a> However, one cannot sense the Creator with just his heart, but only with %0a> small point in it. And to feel this point, man must develop it himself. When %0a> one develops and expands this point, the sensation of the Creator, His Light, %0a> can enter it. %0a> %0a> Our heart is the sum of our egoistic desires, and the small point within it %0a> is part of the spiritual, altruistic desire implanted from Above by the Creator %0a> Himself. It is our task to nurture this embryo of a spiritual desire to such an %0a> ;nt that it (and not our egoistic nature) will determine all of our aspiratior %0a> re time, the egoistic desire of the heart will surrender, contract, ' %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lg born in our world, one is obliged to change his hear %0a> egoistic to altruistic, while living in this world. This is the purpose of %0a> the reason behind his appearance in this world, and it is the goal of all creation. %0a> A complete replacement of egoistic desires with altruistic ones is called "the %0a> End of Correction." Every individual and all of humanity must attain it in this %0a> world together. Until one achieves this, he will continue to be born into this %0a> rid. The Torah and all the prophets speak exclusively of this. The methoc %0a> tion is called "Kabbalah." %0a> %0a> >ne can change his desires only i %0a> solute egoist; he can neither ac %0a> from the surrounding world— as his surroundings are just like him— nor does he %0a> have any link to the spiritual worlds, since such a link is possible only throu£ %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 43 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ence, an individual in our world has no chance of transcending %0a> ies of this world on his own. That is why we were given the To %0a> ost effective part, Kabbalah— to help man acquire the desires of %0a> orlds. %0a> %0a> In order to create man in remoteness to Himself, so that man would realize %0a> his insignificance and would come independently to the desire to ascend, the %0a> Creator created all creation as degrees descending from Him. The Creator's %0a> Light descended along these degrees, and at the lowest degree, created our world %0a> and man in it. Having realized his insignificance and wishing to ascend to the %0a> reator, man (to the extent that he wishes to approach the Creator) ascends %0a> the same degrees by which his initial descent took place. %0a> %0a> In all, there are ten degrees, called "ten Sefirot": Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, %0a> Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Malchut. Like ten screens or curtains, %0a> these ten Sefirot conceal the Creator's Light from us or the Creator Himself %0a> (which is the same thing). These ten screens constitute the ten degrees of our %0a> remoteness from the Creator. %0a> %0a> Therefore, in order to draw near the Creator by one degree, the lowest %0a> one above our own properties, we must acquire the properties of that (lowest) %0a> degree. This means that our properties become similar to the properties of that %0a> degree, rather than remaining inferior to it. To acquire similar properties means %0a> to have the same desires. As soon as our desires coincide with the desires of %0a> that degree, its concealment fades, and we seemingly exist on it, and only nine %0a> degrees separate us from the Creator. %0a> %0a> However, the last, lowest degree differs from all the others: as soon as one %0a> ascends out of our world and onto the first degree, he already begins to see %0a> (sense) the Creator. And all the subsequent degrees are degrees of drawing closer %0a> to the Creator. Only the very last degree, at which we presently exist, conceals %0a> the Creator completely, whereas all of the Higher Degrees only distance Him. %0a> %0a> Although we count ten degrees, there are in fact only five of them. This is %0a> because six degrees: Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, and Yesod combine into %0a> one Sefira, called ZeirAnpin (ZA). ZA itself is sometimes referred to as Tifferet, for %0a> this Sefira reflects the common attributes of all of its six Sefirot. %0a> %0a> So, there are five degrees of concealment from the Creator down to our %0a> world: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut. Every degree is alternatively called %0a> Olam (world), from the word Haalamah (concealment). Every degree has its sub- %0a> degrees, called Partzufim (plural for Partzuf), and every sub-degree has its own %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 44 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> sub-degrees, called Sefirot (plural for Sefira). Thus, in all, 5x5x5 = 125 degrees- %0a> Sefirot exist between us and the Creator. %0a> %0a> Below is a table of the degrees from the Creator down to our world: %0a> %0a> The Creator: an absolutely altruistic desire to create a soul (man) in order %0a> to fill it with delight. %0a> %0a> The world of Infinity: the existence of souls in the ultimate, perfect state. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> WORLDS %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIROT %0a> %0a> %0a> PARTZUFIM %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Galaalta %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 1 st World %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> AB %0a> %0a> %0a> ( * ) %0a> %0a> %0a> Adam Kadmon %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ( * ) %0a> %0a> %0a> (AK) %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> MA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> BON %0a> %0a> %0a> ( * ) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Arirh Annin (AA\ %0a> %0a> r\\ iv/i i r\\ \vj\\ \ %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ?nd Wnrlrl %0a> %0a> L.

Because desire in the spiritual %0a> signates action, desire itself acts, without a body. Therefore, when the desire %0a> create souls (the will to enjoy) appeared in the Creator, when He wished %0a> fill them with the most perfect delight— to sense Him and to delight in His %0a> perfection— to make creatures just as He is, His desire was immediately realized. %0a> Thus appeared the World of Ein Sof, in which we already exist in our final state. %0a> %0a> However, we still need to attain this state in our sensations. This is %0a> reminiscent of a sleeping person: even though he is sleeping somewhere, he %0a> does not understand where he is until he wakes up. However, in order to achieve %0a> is perfect state, we must go through a gradual process of transformation of our %0a> ner properties (desires), which corresponds to the spiritual ascension fror %0a> r world through all the worlds, to the World of Ein Sof. %0a> %0a> lead us to the final state, the Creator governs us from Above thrc %0a> all the worlds. Thus, there is nothing in our world that does not originate in %0a> the World of Ein Sof, where the final state of every soul determines the path %0a> that it is destined to travel in general and the changes that it has to undergo %0a> in particular at every moment (state) of its spiritual advancement towards the %0a> World of Infinity. %0a> %0a> There is no way back: everything that happens is dictated by the necessity to %0a> ing every soul to its final state. Only this goal determines the state of our worl %0a> ery second, what happens to it in general and to each of us in particular. ' %0a> created nothing for naught. Rather, everything serves His purpose. %0a> %0a> However, the will that stems from Above does not exclude our ac %0a> articipation in our own advancement. Instead of being slaves that move %0a> under the compulsion of a beating stick called suffering, we can turn our path %0a> of suffering into the path of Torah— to actively and quickly travel this path %0a> from below upwards on our own by realizing that the Creator's purpose is %0a> indeed desirable. %0a> %0a> This is possible via a request for spiritual elevation— raising MAN, a prayer, %0a> response, we will receive spiritual strength from Above that will help us %0a> our qualities, i.e., to ascend. The entire Torah speaks only of this, and %0a> goes further still and provides a detailed explanation of the path itself, %0a> if on a map, it depicts what we go through and where (in what state and at %0a> :h degree) we are now. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 46 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kabbalah studies the structure of the spiritual worlds. The purpose of these %0a> worlds is to weaken the Creator's signals (desires) so that we could understand %0a> them with our egoism and realize them with our mind. In Hebrew, the word %0a> for "world" is Olam (from the word Haalamah— meaning concealment), for %0a> these worlds conceal and weaken the Creator's Light to such an extent that %0a> we can feel it. %0a> %0a> Depending on everyone's spiritual qualities, on the degree of one's %0a> attainment (complete egoism = our world, partial altruism = spiritual worlds), %0a> we perceive the Creator or His Light differently at each of the 125 degrees. These %0a> 125 degrees amount to just ten, called "the ten Sefirot between the Creator and %0a> us," where every lower Sefira transmits less of the Creator's Light, as perceived %0a> by those at that degree. The lower the Sefira, the less of the Creator's Light it lets %0a> through to those that are below it. %0a> %0a> SEFIROT %0a> %0a> These are the names of the Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, %0a> Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Makhut. However, six of them are combined into one %0a> Sefira, called Zeir Anpin, so in all there are five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, %0a> ZA, and Malchut. Also, ZA himself (ZA is usually considered a male Sefira) is %0a> sometimes called Tifferet, since Tifferet is his main Sefira, absorbing within itself %0a> the properties of all six Sefirot of ZA. Thus, the Creator created only five Sefirot: %0a> %0a> Keter— the Creator's desire to bestow delight upon us, Malchut; %0a> %0a> Hochma— the pleasure itself, which the Creator wishes to bestow upon us; %0a> %0a> Bina— passes the pleasure from Hochma to ZA; %0a> %0a> ZA— accepts the pleasure from Bina and passes it to Malchut; %0a> %0a> Malchut— receives the pleasure. %0a> %0a> Bina consists of two parts: her upper part, called GAR or AVI, is unwilling %0a> to receive the Light from Hochma. However, since the Creator wishes to impart %0a> this Light to the lower ones, the lower part of Bina, called ZAT or YESHSL7T, %0a> receives the Light from Hochma and passes it to ZA. ZA does not want to receive %0a> the Light, but Malchut (to the extent of her correction) evokes ZA to receive %0a> the Light from Bina and pass it on to her. Hence, we sometimes speak of the %0a> general reception of the Light by ZA and Malchut, which are together called %0a> ZON (ZA and Nukva). %0a> %0a> The process is such that Malchut— to the extent that her desires are corrected %0a> from egoism to altruism— asks ZA to receive the Light "for the Creator's sake." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 47 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> To this extent, ZA requests the Light from Bina. Subsequently, Bina turns to %0a> and receives the requested amount of Light from Hochma, then passes it to %0a> ZA. Malchut (to the extent of her corrected properties) merges with ZA via %0a> equivalence of form (desires), and receives this Light. %0a> %0a> Keter, Hochma, and GAR of Bina do not want to receive the Light, but %0a> starting with ZAT of Bina (YESHS L7T), the desire to receive the Light so as to %0a> pass it to the lower ones appears in the Sefirot. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Galgalta or Metzah - forehead %0a> %0a> %0a> "bestowal" %0a> GE %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Eynaim - eyes %0a> %0a> %0a> _.

This desire is to enjoy the Creator's Light or the Creator %0a> (which is the same thing) is the essence of Malchut. We are parts of Malchut. %0a> However, if we have only egoistic desires, we feel the Creator's Light as pleasures %0a> in our world. This is a micro dose of His Light. By correcting our desires %0a> (properties), we can ascend the spiritual degrees of the Upper Worlds, and there %0a> experience the Creator's true delight. %0a> %0a> According to the Thought of Creation, Malchut must receive the Light from %0a> the four previous Sefirot, and delight in it. Hence, Malchut herself consists of five %0a> parts: she receives the Light from the preceding Sefirot in four parts, and senses %0a> it in the fifth. %0a> %0a> All the Sefirot that precede Malchut (excluding Malchut) are similar to our %0a> sensory organs, and Malchut is like the heart that receives from all organs: brain, %0a> sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The heart is Malchut, and the sensory %0a> organs are the first nine Sefirot that precede Malchut. All of these parts of Malchut %0a> are egoistic— they wish to receive the Light (pleasure) so as to enjoy it. With such %0a> properties, Malchut cannot receive more than a micro dose of the Light of our %0a> world, sensing the Creator in a manner called "this world." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 48 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> However, if Malchut, i.e., every one of us, were to receive desires (aspirations) %0a> from Above to bestow delight upon the Creator to the same extent that we feel %0a> the Creator bestowing upon us, with this property (desire), man would ascend %0a> spiritually to a degree above our world. He would sense the Creator as spiritual %0a> Light, altruistic pleasure and great knowledge, attainment of supernal thoughts %0a> and the essence of existence. %0a> %0a> SCREEN %0a> %0a> Malchut (man) can receive the Light only in anti-egoistic desires. If such desires %0a> appear in Malchut as a result of the realization that egoism is her enemy (with %0a> the help of Kabbalah), to the extent of her hatred for it, Malchut can repel %0a> the egoistic pleasures for the sake of spiritual perfection, i.e., similarity to the %0a> Creator in her desire to please Him and act for His sake. %0a> %0a> This ability to repel selfish reception of pleasure is called "a screen," and %0a> the repelled pleasure is called "Returning Light," and the pleasure that comes to %0a> Malchut is called "Direct Light." It is precisely in the repelled pleasure, meaning %0a> in the desire to bestow whole-heartedly, selflessly, that man can sense the %0a> Creator's Light and Supreme Knowledge. %0a> %0a> Since Malchut (man's egoism) has to repel pleasure from the five parts of her %0a> egoism, the reflecting screen must also consist of five parts. Hence, it creates five %0a> parts of the Returning Light. The five parts in Malchut are called by the names %0a> of the Sefirot from which they receive. The five kinds of Direct Light are called %0a> NRNHY: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida. The Light that emanates %0a> from the Creator descends in the following order: %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> PARTZUF %0a> %0a> After Malchut reflects the Light (pleasure), she decides to receive it in order to %0a> delight the Creator, because He wants Malchut to receive pleasure and feel Him. %0a> The reflection of all the incoming pleasure is called Rosh (head). The partial %0a> reception of the Light to the extent of one's anti-egoistic powers is called Toch %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 49 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (interior). The unfulfilled desires (due to the absence of a screen on them) are %0a> called So/ (end) (see below diagram). %0a> %0a> This is the structure of the soul (KU, vessel, corrected altruistic desire, Partzuf %0a> or spiritual body). We call the parts of the spiritual structure by the names of our %0a> physiological body: head, body, and limbs. There are five parts in the Rosh (head): %0a> skull— Galgalta, eyes— Eynairn, ears— Awznaim, nose— Hotem, and mouth— Peh. %0a> There are five parts in the Guf (body) from the mouth— Peh to the navel— Tabur. In %0a> the limbs, there are five parts from the navel to the toes (see below diagram). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> / %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> OhrMakif %0a> (Surrounding Light) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> \ %0a> %0a> OhrYashar * %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 50 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE INVERSE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VESSEL %0a> AND THE LIGHT %0a> %0a> The more strength Malchut has to oppose egoism, the greater the Light that %0a> enters her. However, although one works on the correction of the vessel's coarser %0a> part, he receives the Light from his efforts in his subtler desires. In other words, %0a> there is an inverse proportion between the vessel and the Light: the coarser the %0a> desire (Kli) that is corrected, the greater the Light that enters Malchut (vessel); %0a> however, it enters her Upper Kli (desire). %0a> %0a> Since Malchut (i.e., all that exists apart from the Creator) is absolutely %0a> egoistic, she can only be corrected by imparting onto herself the properties of %0a> Bina, the Creator— bestowal without reception. This is the property of absolute %0a> altruism, of selfless bestowal. To receive such a property (desire) is tantamount %0a> to ascending from the level of Malchut to the level of Bina. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIRA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LIGHT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> If all parts of the Kli can %0a> receive the Light, then %0a> all the outside Light %0a> enters the Sefirot: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIRA %0a> %0a> %0a> LIGHT %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut herself is the will to receive pleasure. The ban imposed on the %0a> reception of pleasure for oneself is called the First Restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph). %0a> Restriction is a ban on the reception of pleasure; however, if the receiver aspires %0a> to please the Creator and not himself, he is allowed to receive the pleasure. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 51 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Whether Malchut wants it or not, if she (soul, man) has egoistic desires, the %0a> Light will not enter her (be felt within her).

This %0a> ban is called the Second Restriction (T?imt?um Bet). In this restriction, Malchut %0a> seemingly ascends in her desires to Sefira Bina. Her desires of "reception" %0a> dominate three Sefirot: Bina, ZA, and Malchut, as Sefirot Bina and ZA also fall %0a> under the rule (desire) of the elevated Malchut. %0a> %0a> If a Partzuf has no strength to oppose its egoistic desires of reception in %0a> Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut (AHP), its lower part is not entitled to receive the %0a> Creator's Light, as it will receive it selfishly, thereby causing great harm to itself. %0a> To avoid this, the upper part of the Partzuf— Sefirot Keter and Hochma (GE)— %0a> separates from the lower part by Parsa (partition), through which the Light %0a> cannot pass downwards. Therefore, as a result of Malchut 's ascent to Bina, each %0a> degree was divided into two parts: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter -Galgalta %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma - Eynaim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Together called Galgalta %0a> Eynaim (GE) %0a> %0a> Parsa = elevated Malchut — %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina - Awzen %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA-Hotem %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut - Peh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Together called AHP %0a> (Awzen, Hotem, and Peh) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut restricted the spreading of Light inside the Partzuf, and two parts %0a> were formed in her: GE receives the Light, i.e., Sefirot Keter and Hochma receive %0a> the Lights Ne/esh and Ruach, while the other part of the Partzuf (Sefirot Bina, %0a> ZA, and Malchut) is below the Parsa, and therefore does not receive the Light. %0a> Their corresponding Lights— Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida— also remain outside %0a> of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 52 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LIGHT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIRA %0a> %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> GE %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This degree (Partzuf) is deprived of the Light Nesharna-Haya-Yechida and is left %0a> with just the Light Nefesh-Ruach, called "air." This is designated by the entry of %0a> the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish). Thus, the word Light %0a> (Ohr) turns into air (Avir = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish). This state of the vessel is called %0a> Katnut (small state). In other words, the ascent of Malchut to Bina is designated %0a> by the entry of the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish +Yod = %0a> Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish = Avir— air). This means that because of Malchut's ascent to %0a> Bina, the Partzuf lost its Light and was left with air. %0a> %0a> In such a state, the degree or Partzuf is called Katnut (smallness), where %0a> Sefirot Keter and Hochma have only the Light Nefesh-Ruach, as Sefirot Bina, ZA and %0a> Malchut are below the Parsa, and do not receive the Light. The Parsa prevents %0a> the Light from spreading below it. Sefirot Keter-Hochma and Bina-ZA-Malchut are %0a> designated by the following letters: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> - Mem - %0a> %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> - Yod - %0a> %0a> %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> - Hey - %0a> %0a> %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> - Lamed - %0a> %0a> %0a> LO %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> - Aleph - %0a> %0a> %0a> E %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 53 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In the reverse order, these letters form the Creator's name Elokirn, where %0a> GE = letters Mem + Yod = IM (pronounced as MI), and AHP = letters Aleph + %0a> Lamed + Hey = ELEH. Since man attains the Creator from below upwards, the %0a> Creator's name ELOKIM is read from below upwards. %0a> %0a> After the birth of all the worlds and the descent of the entire Creation to %0a> our world, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA passed %0a> into the state of Katnut. Thus, the Light is present in GE, but absent in AHP. %0a> AHP of the Upper Degree fell into GE of the lower degree, thus forming the %0a> spiritual ladder between the Creator and man in our world, and the lowest part %0a> of the last spiritual degree of the world of Assiya fell into a point in man's heart. %0a> Consequently, all the intermediate degrees now exist one inside the other: AHP %0a> of the Upper Degree is inside GE of the lower one: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE CREATOR %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The descent of the Light from the Creator down to man in our world %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE WORLD OF AK %0a> , , The head of AA ("unattainable") is considered Infinity %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> _H %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The world of Atzilut = GE and AHP fell into the world of Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> _H %0a> %0a> ~ B J %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The world of Beria = GE and AHP of the world of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> _H %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The world of Yetzira = GE and AHP of the world of Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> _H %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The world of Assiya = GE and AHP of the world of Yetzira %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Our world = man's point in the heart, %0a> which contains AHP of the world of Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The sum of man's desires is referred to as his heart. Since the nature with %0a> which we are born is absolute egoism, man does not feel the spiritual point %0a> in his heart. However, at some point in one of his reincarnations, man begins %0a> to gradually strive towards attainment of the causes of life, its evaluation; he %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 54 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> yearns to attain himself, his source, just as you do right now. Man's aspiration %0a> to the Creator is precisely this aspiration to attain his origin. Man's discontent %0a> in life often helps him in this search, when there's nothing that appeals to him %0a> in his surroundings. Such circumstances are sent from Above in order for man %0a> to start feeling an empty point in his heart, and to stimulate in him the desire %0a> to fulfill it. %0a> %0a> The Creator manifests as the altruistic property to bestow pleasure without %0a> any benefit for Himself. From this, we can understand the property of Sefirot %0a> Keter, Hochma, and Bina that share the Creator's property of bestowal. The only %0a> Creation is Malchut, the will to receive the Light (pleasure). All of us and our %0a> entire world are the lowest part of this egoistic Malchut. %0a> %0a> THE STATE OF QADLUT (GREATNESS/ADULTHOOD) %0a> %0a> However, if one (Malchut) raises MAN, the request for his spiritual ascent, by %0a> making efforts to free himself from egoism and by praying to the Creator for %0a> help, the Light AB-SAG descends from Above. It comes from the world of AK, %0a> brings Malchut altruistic strength and enables her to return from Bina back to %0a> her place. In other words, Malchut's ability to refrain from selfish reception of %0a> pleasure is complemented with the strength to receive pleasure for the Creator's %0a> sake, to receive the Light of Hochma within AHP, for His sake. %0a> %0a> Subsequently, AHP, or Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut, become reactivated, the %0a> Partzuf regains all five Kelim (parts), the letter Yod disappears from the word Avir %0a> (air), and it turns to being Ohr (Light). In that state, all five Lights NRNHY fill %0a> the Partzuf, the letters MI join the letters ELEH, forming the Creator's name— %0a> Elokim. This state is called Gadlut (greatness/ adulthood). %0a> %0a> ASCENT OF THE LOWER ONE TO THE UPPER ONE %0a> %0a> As a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, the Upper Partzuf establishes contact with %0a> the lower one. As a result, the lower Partzuf can ascend to the level of the Upper %0a> One. This is the reason for the second restriction: to give the lower ones (man) %0a> the opportunity to ascend to the World of Infinity, up to the Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> In order to establish this contact, the Upper Partzuf deliberately diminishes %0a> itself, descends to the level of the lower Partzuf, and becomes similar to the lower %0a> one in its properties. AHP of the Upper Partzuf willingly falls into GE of the %0a> lower one, as though it has no strength to receive the Light, and they become %0a> a single whole. This is similar to a scenario when a strong individual joins a %0a> society of criminals, imitating their behavior, so that after being admitted into %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 55 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> their circle and establishing contact with them, he will gradually influence and %0a> correct them. %0a> %0a> How? The Upper Light (the so-called Light of AB-SAG) comes and provides %0a> AHP of the Upper Partzuf with the strength to ascend to their GE. And GE of the %0a> lower Partzuf ascend together with them: because they were a single whole and %0a> equivalent in their properties below, they receive the same strength to ascend. %0a> %0a> Upon receiving the Light of AB-SAG, GE of the lower Partzuf become %0a> like Upper One. Therefore, we should not regard the second restriction as %0a> negative, but as help from the Upper Partzuf. It descends to the lower Partzuf by %0a> corrupting its own properties in order to equalize itself with the lower one, so as %0a> to subsequently ascend together with it to its previous level. This way, the lowest %0a> degree can ascend not only to the next Higher One, but also to the Highest %0a> Degree of the spiritual ladder. %0a> %0a> THE LIGHT OF ZON IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLDS BYA %0a> %0a> Partzuf YESHSUT is AHP of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, and all that it %0a> receives and passes to ZON of the world of Atzilut subsequently descends to the %0a> worlds of BYA and then to us. %0a> %0a> In the small state (Katnut), AHP of YESHSUT falls into ZON. Then %0a> YESHSUT receives strength, and by elevating its AHP, it elevates ZON, too. %0a> By ascending to YESHSUT, ZON become similar to it and receive the Light %0a> at the level of YESHSUT. ZON can never receive the Light of Hochma in their %0a> own level; they can only receive the Light of Hassadim, the Light essential to %0a> their existence. %0a> %0a> ZON of the world of Atzilut are called Olam (world), just as our world is also %0a> called Olam, for all that ZON de Atzilut receive can be received by man in this %0a> world. And vice versa— all that ZON de Atzilut cannot receive is unattainable to %0a> man, for we attain only up to the level of ZON, and not higher. %0a> %0a> And since ZON cannot receive the Light of Hochma in their place, the %0a> Creator purposely initiated the second restriction, thereby lowering the Sefirot %0a> of AHP of Partzuf YESHSUT down to ZON, so that ZON would be able to %0a> ascend to YESHSUT and higher, up to the Highest Degree. Hence, it is said %0a> in the Torah (Beresheet BaraK): "In the beginning the Creator created all in %0a> judgment (restriction), but after seeing that the world (ZON) cannot exist %0a> (receive all of the Light of Hochma prepared for it), added to judgment the %0a> property of mercy." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 56 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In the beginning, He elevated Malchut (the restriction of YESHSUT, for %0a> Malchut is restricted from receiving Light) to Bina (mercy of YESHSUT). As a %0a> result, AHP of YESHSUT fell into ZON and merged with them. However, the %0a> world (ZON) still cannot exist in this way. Hence, the Creator added mercy to %0a> judgment: He gave YESHSUT the strength to elevate its AHP together with ZON %0a> to the degree of YESHSUT. There, ZON receive the Light of YESHSUT and pass %0a> it down to all the worlds of BYA and to our world. %0a> %0a> CORRECTION IN THREE LINES %0a> %0a> Each of the ten Sefirot in turn consists of ten individual sub-Sefirot. Malchut %0a> ascends to Bina in each individual Sefira, i.e., to the full height of the ten %0a> Sefirot; in each particular Sefira, Malchut moves up from its place to the place %0a> of Bina in that Sefira: %0a> %0a> (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-K %0a> (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-H %0a> (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-B %0a> (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-ZA %0a> (M-ZA-I B-H-K)-M %0a> %0a> The sign | signifies a particular Parsa in a Sefira, the restriction imposed on %0a> the spreading of Light. GE that remain in each Sefira above the Parsa are called %0a> the "right line," for there is Light in them. Malchut that ascends to Bina in each %0a> Sefira creates the "left line" with her restriction on the reception of Light. A %0a> Zivug made on the elevated Malchut (only on the free, unrestricted Kelim KHB) %0a> allows the Light of Hassadim to shine in GE, and this reception of the Light of %0a> Hassadim in GE is called the "middle line." %0a> %0a> Now let us clarify what is written in The Zohar: There are ten Sefirot: Keter %0a> (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Hesed (H), Gevura (G), Tifferet (T), Netzah (N), Hod %0a> (H), Yesod (Y), and Malchut (M). However, there are actually only five of them: %0a> Keter (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Tifferet (T), and Malchut (M). This is because %0a> Tifferet (alternatively called Zeir An£>in— ZA) consists of six Sefirot, from Hesed to %0a> Yesod. Five Sefirot KHB-ZA-M created five Partzufim in each world. In the world %0a> of Atzilut, these Partzufim are Arich Anpin (AA), Aba ve Ima (AVI), and Zeir An£>in %0a> and Nukva (ZON). Keter is called AA; correspondingly, Hochma and Bina are %0a> called AVI; and ZA (Tifferet) and Malchut are called ZON. %0a> %0a> The essence of the seven days of creation lies in Partzufim ZA and Nukva of %0a> the world of Atzilut, which consist of seven Sefirot: HGT-NHYM. And from the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 57 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> description of creation it transpires how AVI (Hochma and Bina) beget ZON (all %0a> of creation, including us) and elevate them to their final state during the 6,000 %0a> years. This is what The Book of Zohar tells us. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Hizkiyah began his explanation of Nukva of the world of Atzilut %0a> by clarifying the birth of ZON from Ima (Bina), called Elokim. That is why he %0a> began his explanation with a rose, Nukva of ZA. At the utmost completion of %0a> its development, Nukva of ZA is called Knesset Israel, the Assembly of Israel. %0a> For Nukva consists of all the souls called Israel; hence, it is said that a rose is %0a> Knesset Israel. %0a> %0a> There are two states in a rose (Malchut). The lowest, initial, small state %0a> (Katnut) is when Malchut consists only of Sefira Keter filled with the Light %0a> Nefesh, while her other nine Sefirot are those that fell from the world of Atzilut %0a> to the world of Beria. The other state of Nukva is mature, big, complete %0a> (Gadlut), when her nine Sefirot ascend from the world of Beria back to the %0a> world of Atzilut, and complete the full ten Sefirot of her Partzuf. Then, being %0a> equal to her husband, Malchut ascends together with him to AVI and clothes %0a> them, i.e., receives their Light. %0a> %0a> The clothing of the lower, outer Partzuf onto the Upper, Inner One means %0a> that the lower Partzuf attains a part of the Upper One, ascends to a Higher %0a> spiritual level, and becomes in some way similar to the Upper Partzuf. %0a> %0a> In that state, ZA is called Israel, from the letters LI (to me) and ROSH %0a> (head), which signifies the state of Gadlut, while Nukva is called "the Assembly %0a> of Israel," for she accumulates all of the Light of her husband, ZA, and passes it %0a> to the lower ones— the souls in the worlds BYA. %0a> %0a> Nukva 's state of Katnut is called "a rose among thorns," for nine of her lower %0a> Sefirot in the Katnut state fell under the Parsa of the world of Atzilut, thereby %0a> losing the Light of the world of Atzilut, and becoming as dry as thorns. And in %0a> her Gadlut state, Nukva is simply called "a rose" or "the Assembly of Israel." This %0a> is why it is written, "there is a rose, and there is a rose." %0a> %0a> The color red designates the rose's connection with the outer, impure forces, %0a> which, because of this connection, can suck the strength (Light) from it. This is %0a> because nine of her Sefirot are in exile below the world of Atzilut, in the world %0a> of Beria, which may already contain impure forces. And the rose also has a color %0a> white in its Sefira Keter, for her Sefira Keter is in the world of Atzilut, above the %0a> Parsa, where there is no contact with the lower, impure forces. In other words, %0a> there are two opposite states: perfection and its absence, Light and darkness. %0a> They are felt by him who merits it. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 58 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It is therefore written that just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red %0a> and white, so does the Assembly of Israel consist of judgment and mercy. This %0a> shows that in Gadlut, when Malchut is called Knesset Israel, even though she %0a> ascended to Bina and clothed her, she still retains the property of judgment, of %0a> restriction— an attitude that's tough and just, rather than compassionate. This %0a> is so because she needs a screen (a force of resistance to her egoistic desires), %0a> which, if available, enables Malchut to receive the Upper Light. %0a> %0a> The law, judgment, or restriction does not allow for the reception of Light %0a> in egoistic desires. The screen, the aspiration to oppose one's egoistic desires, %0a> repels the Upper Light (pleasure) back to its source, the Creator. The Light that %0a> man sends back is called "Returning Light" or the "Light of Judgment." To %0a> the extent of the intensity of the reflective force (i.e., the force of resistance to %0a> one's will to receive), man is allowed to receive the ten Sefirot of the Upper Light %0a> (called the Direct Light or the Light of Mercy) for the Creator's sake, in precisely %0a> these altruistic desires. And that is why, even in its complete state, the Assembly %0a> of Israel consists of judgment and mercy, which corresponds to the red and %0a> white colors of a rose among thorns. %0a> %0a> And this is the pool made by King Shlomo (Solomon). It is built on twelve %0a> bulls, for the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut that fell to the world of Beria were %0a> corrected there from twelve heads of bulls. One of their Sefirot, Keter, which %0a> remained in the world of Atzilut, is called the "pool" that is built on these bulls. %0a> Together, they are called thirteen rose petals. (The reason why the ten Sefirot of %0a> Malchut are divided by ten-Hassadim or thirteen-Hochma will be clarified later). %0a> %0a> The Light of a complete Nukva is called Hochma, as it contains the Light of %0a> Wisdom, and originates from the thirteen names called "the thirteen attributes %0a> of mercy." However, the main thing that Rabbi Hizkiyah wants to tell us is that %0a> a rose among thorns is above the Assembly of Israel, because, as is well known, %0a> all that is present in Nukva's complete state must exist in her small state as well, %0a> albeit in diminished similarity. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is said that the properties of white and red in the small state %0a> correspond to the properties of mercy and judgment in the big state. And the %0a> thirteen petals of the small state, when corrected, create in Nukva the thirteen %0a> attributes of mercy in her big state. Later on, we will see how these thirteen %0a> attributes of Malchut of the world of Atzilut change her in both the small and %0a> big states. %0a> %0a> It is written that, in the process of creation, "in the beginning Elokim (Bina %0a> de Atzilut) created" Nukva of ZA with thirteen words: ET, SHAMAJM, VE'ET, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 59 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ARETZ, VEARETZ, HAITA, TOHL7, VABOHU, VECHOSHECH, AL, PNEI, %0a> TEHOM, VERLACH (from the word Elokim to the word Elokim). And these %0a> thirteen words signify the thirteen petals of a rose among thorns (her small %0a> state), like the pool built by the King Shlomo, which stands on thirteen (twelve) %0a> bulls (nine lower Sefirot of Malchut without Light, as they are in the world of %0a> Beria, below the Parsa of the world of Atzilut). These words are the preparation %0a> for the purification and correction of the Assembly of Israel in order to receive %0a> the thirteen attributes of mercy. %0a> %0a> These thirteen attributes of mercy (the Light of a complete Nukva) surround %0a> her and shine upon her from all sides, and guard her from the touch of foreign %0a> (egoistic) desires. After all, until she is filled with all the Light of Hochma in her %0a> complete, big state, there's a potential for foreign, egoistic desires to cling to and %0a> feed off her. %0a> %0a> 2. Afterwards, the name Elokim is mentioned once more, "Elokim soars." %0a> Why is it mentioned in this sense? So as to bring out the five rigid leaves that %0a> surround the rose, which are called "salvation." And these are the five gates. %0a> And it is said of this secret, I will raise the "cup of salvation" (Psalms, 116:13). %0a> It is the cup of blessing. The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, just as a %0a> rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this rose is %0a> the cup of blessing, from the second to the third mention of the name Elokim %0a> (Beresheet, 1:2-3), there are five words: "soars," "over," "the surface," "of the %0a> waters," "and said"— in all, five words parallel the five leaves. And further, %0a> "The Creator said, 'Let there be Light'"— this Light was created. However, it %0a> was concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and %0a> fructified it. And it is referred to as "A fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed %0a> thereof" (Beresheet, 1:12). And this seed exists in the mark of the covenant. %0a> %0a> The five leaves are the five Sefirot of the Light reflected from Malchut, which %0a> she raises from the Zivug de Hakaa. The direct incoming Light is called five %0a> Hassadim HGT-NH, and it clothes into five parts (types of restrictions) of the %0a> Returning Light HGT-NH, called the five rigid leaves of a rose, which correspond %0a> to the text from the second (the spirit of God soared over the waters) to the third %0a> (and said) mention of the word Elokim in the Torah. %0a> %0a> These words explain how the five rigid leaves (attributes) can be extracted %0a> from Malchut so that she will be fit for a Zivug and achieve the big state. And %0a> during the big state, when the five rigid leaves become five restrictions, they %0a> are defined as the five gates of reception of the Light of Hassadim of the Direct %0a> Light, and they are called salvation, and Malchut is called the cup of salvation or %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 60 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the cup of blessing and good fortune, for, thanks to these leaves (restrictions), %0a> Malchut can receive the Light of Hassadim— a blessing. %0a> %0a> The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, for Malchut can receive the Light %0a> of Hochma only if she is clothed in the Light of Hassadim beforehand. Therefore, %0a> first she has to make a blessing, which means to receive the five parts (NRNHY) %0a> of the Light of Hassadim with the help of five fingers (five restrictions), and only %0a> then to receive in them (i.e., in the corrected intentions) the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> Hence, a cup of wine must be raised with two hands, as five fingers of %0a> the right hand symbolize mercy— Hassadim, and five fingers of the left hand %0a> symbolize restrictions. However, having started the blessing, the cup must only %0a> be held with the five fingers of the right hand (Hassadim, bestowing). Otherwise, %0a> the impure forces that take from the left (receiving) side become active, as such %0a> forces cling only to a place where there is reception of Light. %0a> %0a> What follows is the big state of Malchut, which corresponds to the words %0a> of the To rah: "Let there be Light." These are the five lights, in which Adam %0a> saw the world from end to end, as it is written in the Talmud (Hagigah, 12). %0a> But the Creator saw that there would be transgressions in the generations of %0a> the Flood and the Tower of Babel, and concealed this Light. And the following %0a> generations will then need to attain it on their own. %0a> %0a> Previously, these five Hassadim were in Yesod of ZA, and Malchut received %0a> from it, and not from Bina, called Elokim, as she does now. Yesod de ZA is %0a> called the mark of the covenant with the Creator (after the corrections, called %0a> circumcision, are made), and five Hassadim received on the five restrictions are %0a> called "seed." The main force of restrictions and the impact forces of the screen, %0a> with which it repels the Light, are in Ateret Yesod (the end of the Sefira Yesod). %0a> There occurs Zivug de Hakaa, from which Malchut receives the Light. Only at the %0a> end of correction will this Zivug pass on to Malchut herself. %0a> %0a> Therefore, during the 6,000 years, the screen that is in Yesod, strikes at %0a> the incoming Light (pleasure) with its five restrictions (the forces that oppose %0a> egoistic reception of pleasure), thus creating five parts of the Returning Light, %0a> and receiving in them the five parts of the Light of Hassadim. Subsequently, %0a> ZA passes these five Lights of Hassadim from his Yesod to Nukva. And these five %0a> Lights of Hassadim are called "seed." %0a> %0a> 3. Just as the covenant is conceived from that seed in forty-two Zivugim, %0a> so the secret name fills and inseminates all forty-two letters of the initial %0a> act of creation. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Rose %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 61 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The name "forty-two" = MB = Mem + Bet = 40 + 2 is composed of HaVaYaH %0a> (four letters), filled HaVaYaH (ten letters), and doubly filled HaVaYaH (twenty- %0a> eight letters). In all, 4 + 10 + 28 = 42, signifying the seed that exists in the mark %0a> of the covenant that is enclosed in five Hassadim and five Gevurot. %0a> %0a> There are two aspects to Nukva: her body (Partzuf), which emerges from Bina, %0a> and her Zivug, called the secret of unity with ZA. Nukva can be in two states: %0a> small or big (Katnut or Gadlut respectively). The small state is an incomplete, %0a> insufficient state of Malchut, but it is necessary as preparation for the big state, %0a> called the revelation of the secret, of the concealed. %0a> %0a> And since the big state reveals the small, and all that is concealed in the %0a> small state becomes clear in the big, he who is in a state of spiritual descent does %0a> not see the reasons for his state, but it all becomes clear to him when he attains %0a> the big state that follows. %0a> %0a> As a result of the ascent of Malchut of AVI to their Bina, Partzuf of Bina (AVI) %0a> was divided into two parts: the upper part, GE, acquired the name AVI, while %0a> the lower part, AHP, became known as YESHSUT. AVI are filled with the Light %0a> of Hassadim, since they wish for no other, and YESHSUT receives it from them, %0a> for, although it desires the Light of Hochma, it cannot receive it in view of the %0a> fact that Malchut of AVI ascended above it. %0a> %0a> However, although there is no Light of Hochma in AVI, they do not suffer %0a> without it whatsoever, and therefore exist in perfection called GAR, even in the %0a> absence of the Light of Hochma. And even when one raises MAN requesting %0a> strength (i.e., the Light of Hochma) so as to overcome his impure desires, AVI %0a> do not receive the Light of Hochma. YESHSUT receives this Light and passes it %0a> to ZA. Hence, although AVI are below the Rosh of AA, and there is no Light of %0a> Hochma in them, they do not suffer from it. %0a> %0a> However, YESHSUT suffers from the absence of the Light of Hochma, %0a> wishing to pass it to ZA, so it waits for MAN from ZA in order to ascend to AVI %0a> in the form of Sefira Daat. For when the lower ones raise MAN, the whole of %0a> Bina ascends to the Rosh of AA; YESHSUT receives the Light of Hochma from %0a> AA and passes it to ZON. This corresponds to the disappearance of the letter Yod %0a> from the word Avir (air), and Avir turns into Ohr— Light (Hochma) once more. %0a> %0a> However, for all that, even in the Rosh of AA, AVI remain only with the Light %0a> of Hassadim (air). Hence, the heads of both AA and AVI are called "Supreme %0a> Waters" or "Heaven." This is considering the fact that AVI can be beneath the %0a> Rosh of AA; however, since it does not affect their independence and perfection, %0a> it is as if they are in the Rosh of AA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 62 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Under AVI there is a firmament (Parsa) of the world of Atzilut, which %0a> separates the Kelim of bestowal from the Kelim of reception of the world of %0a> Atzilut. YESHSUT and ZON (inferior waters) that need the Light of Hochma %0a> stand below the Parsa, which is in the chest of AA. It is therefore said that %0a> the inferior waters weep (i.e., their state is small), for they feel the lack of Ohr %0a> Hochma and wish to ascend to the Rosh of AA. In no way should one confuse %0a> the Parsa of the world of Atzilut (located within the world of Atzilut) that divides %0a> it into GE and AHP with the Parsa below the world Atzilut that separates it from %0a> the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> The Light that is received above the Parsa of the world of Atzilut is called the %0a> Light of Mem-Bet (MB). However, the seven Sefirot of ZON (six Sefirot of ZA and %0a> one Sefira of Malchut) that designate the seven days of creation cannot receive %0a> this Light of MB, as they are located below the Parsa and receive only the Light %0a> of Hassadim (minimal sustenance) from YESHSUT. %0a> %0a> However, when the lower ones (man) raise MAN, and MAD descends from %0a> AB-SAG (the Light that brings Bina back to the Rosh of AA), YESHSUT receives %0a> the Light of Hochma and passes it to ZON, allowing ZON to ascend above the %0a> Parsa that stands in the Chazeh (chest) of AA, and receive the Light of MB. %0a> %0a> That is why the Light of MB in ZON is manifested in thirty-two Elokim and %0a> ten sayings, where thirty-two Elokim represent YESHSUT in the state of ascent, %0a> when YESHSUT receives thirty-two streams of wisdom (Hochma) that create in %0a> it the thirty-two names of Elokim, mentioned in the act of creation: "In the %0a> beginning the Creator created," and so on. %0a> %0a> The ten sayings are five Hassadim. After ZON have already received the %0a> Light of Hochma from thirty-two Elokim, the five Lights of Hassadim that were %0a> received from AVI (signifying MB) are called "Supreme Waters." We see that the %0a> five Hassadim in ZON do not turn into the name MB before they receive from %0a> thirty-two Elokim. It is therefore said that thirty-two Elokim and ten sayings form %0a> the name MB, i.e., in the state of ascent. %0a> %0a> Hence, Rabbi Hizkiyah said that the five Lights in the saying "Let there be %0a> Light" (signifying the five Hassadim) are called "seed" (abundance), which Yesod %0a> of ZA passes to Malchut. And it is called MB, although essentially it is merely %0a> five Hassadim; however, since it has the Light of Hochma that was received from %0a> thirty-two Elokim of YESHSUT, it refers to MB. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Flower Buds %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 4. In the Beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, "The flower buds have appeared %0a> on the earth" (In Hebrew the words "land" and "earth" are designated by the %0a> same word, Eretz', Song of Songs, 2:12). "The flower buds" refer to the act of %0a> creation; "appeared on the earth." When? On the third day, as it is said, "And %0a> the earth brought forth grass" (Beresheet, 1:12). "The time of singing has %0a> come" refers to the fourth day, the time of strictness, judgment, restriction. %0a> Therefore, on the fourth day, the word "lights" is written with a missing letter, %0a> which hints at the strictness of judgment and a curse. "And the voice of the %0a> turtle dove is heard" refers to the fifth day, on which it is said, "Let the waters %0a> swarm," so that they can produce offspring. However, the words "is heard" %0a> already refer to the sixth day, on which it is said, "Let us make man," who, %0a> in the future, shall put action before understanding (we shall do and we shall %0a> hear, Naaseh ve Nishmah). For here it is said, "Let us make man," and there %0a> it is said, "We shall do and we shall hear." "In our land" refers to the day of %0a> Shabbat, which is like the Land of Life, the world to come. %0a> %0a> It is completely incomprehensible to us how The Zohar compares the words %0a> from Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs, 2:12) with what is written in the Torah about %0a> the first days of creation. The six days of creation symbolize the six Sefirot HGT %0a> NHY of ZA, onto which all ten Sefirot of Nukva are built. This is because Nukva %0a> is only the will to receive (pleasure), while her entire spiritual body (desires of %0a> bestowal) consists of her husband's Sefirot, ZA, the altruistic properties that ZA %0a> passes to Nukva. %0a> %0a> Nukva herself (the created desire to receive pleasure) is an empty place %0a> unfilled with Light (the Creator). This is because the Light can only enter a %0a> desire (Klz) with similar properties to itself. Therefore, to the extent of her %0a> similarity to ZA, the properties that Malchut receives from ZA, those corrected %0a> properties of Malchut turn into a Partzuf and become filled with the Light that %0a> corresponds to their correction. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 63 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 64 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Thus, the greater the correction that is made in a particular part, the greater %0a> the Light (of the five Lights NRNHY) that enters that part. The corrected and %0a> fulfilled part of Malchut is referred to as a "world." Here and henceforth, The %0a> Zohar explains how ~Nukva is built out of ZA, i.e., how the world is created. %0a> %0a> Nukva is called "earth." Flower buds are Sefirot— the properties of ZA %0a> that appear and grow within Malchut on the third day of creation, which %0a> corresponds to Sefira Tifferet (Hesed-l, Gevura-2, Tifferet-3). In the beginning, %0a> Malchut was created as ZA in height; two equally great celestial bodies, the %0a> Sun— ZA and the Moon— Malchut. This is why we see them as being equal in %0a> size when the Moon is full. After all, all that is said with regard to man. In the %0a> initial state following her creation, Malchut is a point at the feet of ZA, and %0a> subsequently grows along him. %0a> %0a> That is to say, on the third day of creation, Malchut was equal in height %0a> (had the same properties) to Tifferet of ZA. However, Malchut was not able to %0a> receive the Light in such a state. Hence, it is said, STRICTNESS (judgment) %0a> APPEARED ON THE EARTH (in Malchut); the flower buds merely appeared. %0a> %0a> And after that, THE TIME OF SINGING HAS COME already refers to the %0a> fourth day of creation, when Malchut was diminished, because she complained %0a> to the Creator: "Two angels cannot wear one crown"— if Malchut is equal to ZA %0a> in height, she cannot receive the Light of Hochma from him. %0a> %0a> The reason for that being— not having received the Light of Hassadim from %0a> ZA beforehand, Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma, as the Light of %0a> Hochma can only be received within the Light of Hassadim, by clothing the Light %0a> of Hochma (pleasure) into the Light of Hassadim (the intention to enjoy "for the %0a> Creator's sake"). %0a> %0a> And the Creator answered Malchut: "Go and diminish yourself." In other %0a> words: if, owing to your egoistic properties, you cannot receive the Light %0a> independently, but only from ZA, then diminish your own properties, accept %0a> His, and gradually correct yourself. Then you will be able to receive all of the %0a> Light and be like Him (ZA— the Creator). All of this is described in the Talmud %0a> (Hullin, 60:2), but only with the explanation provided in The Zohar do we stop %0a> perceiving it as a fairytale. %0a> %0a> Then Malchut descended below Yesod of ZA, and her nine lower Sefirot %0a> fell below Parsa into the worlds of BYA. And only her Sefira Keter remained %0a> in Atzilut as a point standing below Yesod of ZA. And from here on, Malchut %0a> is built not of her own Sefirot (properties) that exist in BYA, but of Sefirot %0a> (properties) Net^ah and Hod of ZA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Flower Buds %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 65 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Although Malchut was previously bigger, she was not able to receive the %0a> Light for lack of the Light of Hassadim; now she will be smaller, but she will %0a> have the Light of Hassadim, in which she will be able to receive the Light of %0a> Hochma. Even though Malchut will be at a lower degree, she will be able to utilize %0a> it, for the Light of Hassadim repels the impure forces that cling to Nulcva. That %0a> is the meaning of the word Zamir (singing/ pruning). However, there is another %0a> meaning to this word that is at use here— cutting off, or pruning the impure %0a> forces from Malchut (rose bud). %0a> %0a> THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE DOVE: The turtle dove is a Sefira, the %0a> property of Net^ah de ZA, and the voice of the turtle dove represents Sefira Hod %0a> of ZA, the fifth day of creation. And since Malchut receives from Yesod (which %0a> receives from Hod that is joined with Netjah), such reception by Malchut is %0a> referred to as "the voice of the turtle dove." %0a> %0a> Therefore, the words "is heard" refer to the sixth day, since the voice of the %0a> turtle dove (Malchut) is heard only with the help of the sixth day, Yesod of ZA, %0a> which includes both Net^ah and Hod, and passes their Light to Malchut. Hence, %0a> it is said that this voice is heard in Malchut only from Yesod, on the sixth day. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that Malchut can receive the Light only from the %0a> middle line of ZA: either from Yesod of ZA (she receives the degree called NHY, %0a> Ihur - embryo) or from Tifferet of ZA (she receives the degree called HGT = VAK, %0a> Yenilca - nursing or Katnut - smallness) or from Daat of ZA (she receives the %0a> degree called HBD = GAR, Mochin - brain or Gadlut - big). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Left %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> LINES %0a> %0a> Middle %0a> %0a> _L_ %0a> %0a> %0a> Right %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> NAME %0a> OF DEGREE %0a> %0a> %0a> THE LIGHT %0a> IN THE DEGREE %0a> %0a> %0a> ( Bina %0a> M %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> )M %0a> Daat %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma) %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> HBD {HaBaD) %0a> %0a> %0a> The Light of Neshama %0a> = The light of HBD %0a> %0a> %0a> ( Gevura %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> ! , %0a> %0a> Tifferet %0a> %0a> %0a> Hesed J %0a> %0a> %0a> HGT [HaGaT) %0a> %0a> %0a> The Light of Ruach %0a> = The light of HGT %0a> %0a> %0a> f Hod %0a> %0a> %0a> H-( %0a> %0a> Yesod %0a> %0a> %0a> Netzah J %0a> j %0a> %0a> %0a> NHY {NeHY) %0a> %0a> %0a> The Light of Nefesh %0a> = The light of NHY %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 66 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LET US MAKE MAN, FOR IN THE FUTURE HE SHALL PUT ACTION %0a> BEFORE LISTENING: sight refers to Sefira Hochma, hearing refers to Sefira %0a> Bina. Action or deed is a property of Malchut. In order to correct Malchut, the %0a> Creator's only creation (other Sefirot are properties of the Creator Himself, with %0a> which He gradually created Malchut), a second restriction was made— Malchut %0a> ascended to Bina so as to combine her egoistic properties of reception with %0a> Bina's altruistic properties of bestowal; Malchut ascended to Aba-Hochma, and %0a> Ima-Bina found herself below Malchut (Parsa), where she became similar in her %0a> properties to Malchut. %0a> %0a> Eyes refer to Sefira Hochma or Aba. Malchut ascended to the level of eyes and %0a> stands at the level of pupils. Malchut is called Nukva; and Malchut that stands %0a> at the level of eyes is called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils) or NE. That is why there are %0a> only Keter and Hochma in the Rosh (head) of AA: Bina fell from the Rosh to the %0a> Guf (body) and Malchut is above Bina, that is, Malchut represents an action that %0a> is Above, i.e., precedes perception and understanding. This is what is meant %0a> by "we will do, and we will hear"— the act of the second restriction, limiting %0a> reception only to GE. Such a state is called the "return" (in one's properties to %0a> the Creator). The "complete return" occurs when AHP of Malchut gets corrected %0a> and joins GE at this degree. %0a> %0a> As a result of Malchut's ascent to NE, she changes her properties (every one %0a> of us needs only this— to ascend to the level of the Creator's properties, so that %0a> we can receive them and become like Him), and is now ready to ascend to AVI %0a> and receive the Light of Haya. The constant Light of this level is called the First %0a> Temple. That is why when receiving the Torah, Israel elected to act first and hear %0a> after. And for this reason they merited reception of the Torah (Talmud, Shabbat, %0a> 85:1), as the action (Malchut) ascended and clothed AVI, and thus the secret of %0a> the fifty gates of Bina was revealed. %0a> %0a> Construction of the Temple does not pertain to it being built in this world, %0a> but rather to the attainment of the degree of the Temple, the degree of AVI %0a> de Atzilut, the Light of Haya (the First Temple) or the degree of YESH %0a> Atzilut, the Light of Neshama (the Second Temple). %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar tells us: "it is heard" on the sixth day, for on this day (in this %0a> state) Malchut was corrected by means of her ascent above Bina, referred to as %0a> "placing action before listening," to do and to hear as during the reception of %0a> the Torah. Malchut in the state of ascension to Bina is called the Eternal Land or %0a> the Land of Life, for she inherits life from Bina. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Flower Buds %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 67 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> "IN OUR LAND" REFERS TO SHABBAT, WHICH IS LIKE THE %0a> ETERNAL LAND OF LIFE: Ima-Bina is called the Land of Life or the Eternal %0a> Land. As a result of the act on the sixth day, meaning the Creator's action from %0a> Above (the factor of time is designated by an action of the Creator Himself, %0a> which has no causes in our world), Malchut ascended to Ima on the seventh day %0a> of creation (Shabbat) and became like Ima, for when the lower one ascends to %0a> the degree of the Upper One, they become equal (in properties). Hence, upon %0a> ascending to Bina and there receiving the Light of Haya, Malchut is called the %0a> Land of Eternal Life. %0a> %0a> 5. Another explanation: flower buds are the Patriarchs, who entered the mind %0a> and entered into the world to come, Bina, where they remain concealed. %0a> From there they emerge in concealment and conceal themselves in the true %0a> prophets. Yosef was born and they concealed themselves within him. When %0a> Yosef entered the Holy Land, he erected them there, and then "they appeared %0a> on the earth" and were revealed there. When did they appear? When a rainbow %0a> can be seen, they become revealed. At that moment, "the time of singing has %0a> come," meaning the time to eradicate all the wicked in the world. Why did %0a> they survive? Because the flower buds have appeared on (from) the earth. And %0a> if they were to be seen beforehand, they could not have remained in the %0a> world, and the world would not have been able to exist. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 68 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar explains the attainment of the Light of Haya by ZA. NHY of %0a> ZA are called "sons" and HGT of ZA are called "patriarchs," as well as the "turtle %0a> dove." ZA himself (seemingly) consists of two parts: above his Chazeh, his Sefirot %0a> HGT are called the big ZON; below his Chazeh, Sefirot NHY are called the small %0a> ZON. Sefirot HGT correspond to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, while NHY %0a> correspond to Moshe, Aaron and Yosef. Malchut corresponds to King David. %0a> %0a> Sefirot NHY are called "prophets," and Yesod is called "the righteous one." %0a> Here The Zohar speaks of the buds that gradually grow from the small state %0a> to the big state of ZON: first ZON were small, consisting of Sefirot NHY with %0a> the Light of Ne/esh and called Uhar (embryo). Then, with the help of Yenika %0a> (nursing), i.e., receiving Light from Ima, ZON grew. Accordingly, the properties %0a> of Sefirot NHY grew to equalize those of Sefirot HGT, and Sefirot NHY received %0a> the Light of Ruach. %0a> %0a> Thus, the Partzuf now consists of parts of HGT and NHY with the Lights %0a> Ruach and Ne/esh. Subsequently, by further reception of strength from the Upper %0a> One, and further growth, they've attained the state of Gadlut Aleph, the first big %0a> state. Accordingly, Sefirot HGT became HBD with the Light of Neshama, Sefirot %0a> NHY became Sefirot HGT, and received new Sefirot NHY. %0a> %0a> Thus, the Partzuf grew to include three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY with the %0a> Lights Ne/esh, Ruach, and Nesharna. And it is called Gadol (big— the first big state). %0a> Then, through further growth, they've attainted the state of maturity (Gadlut %0a> Bet, the second big state), and the Light of Haya entered Sefirot HBD. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 1. Embryo 2. Small 3. Big %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Flower Buds %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 69 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The word "growth" refers to the growth of a screen, of man's inner anti- %0a> egoistic forces and desires. This is the only difference between a big vessel and %0a> a small one, the only difference between the Partzufim. Their inner properties %0a> change depending on the change in the magnitude of the screen. %0a> %0a> THESE FATHERS ENTERED THE SUPERNAL MIND AND %0a> ASCENDED INTO THE WORLD TO COME: this sentence speaks of the %0a> prenatal development of ZA, when he ascends to AVI (called "Supernal Mind" %0a> or "Supernal Thought"). Aba-Hochma is called "mind" or "thought," and lma- %0a> Bina is called "the world to come." And together they are called "parents"— father %0a> and mother, AVI. It is there that creation begins— conception of ZA in the initial %0a> state of a spiritual embryo. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ler, so can every man become a spiritual embryo; if he completely relinqui %0a> all of his desires and actions, and submits entirely to the will of the Upper %0a> Partzuf, he will turn himself into a spiritual embryo, just like a physiological %0a> one. The difference between a physiological embryo and a spiritual one lies %0a> in the fact that becoming a spiritual embryo requires tremendous personal %0a> sire and effort, whereas the conception of a physiological embryo deper %0a> rents. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> pends %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As a result of its prenatal development within Bina (which means that one %0a> completely extinguishes all of his personal desires and thoughts, and, like an %0a> embryo, is ready to accept all that the mother gives: all of her thoughts and %0a> properties, regardless of how incomprehensible or unnatural they may seem to %0a> his essence), this embryo achieves the state of its spiritual birth. %0a> %0a> However, this is a state of an even greater concealment of the Upper Light %0a> with regard to the embryo, for it does not yet have a screen for the reception of %0a> this Light. Hence, this state is called Katnut, CONCEALED IN THE TRUE %0a> PROPHETS, i.e., in Sefirot Netzah and Hod, which ZA attains as a result of %0a> the process of nursing, reception of milk, the Light of Hassadim from Ima %0a> (mother) Bina. %0a> %0a> The Light of nursing comes to the NHY of ZA, and ZA attains VAK (Light %0a> of Nefesh-Ruach), the state of Katnut. During nursing, ZA attains the Sefira %0a> Yesod, which is why it is said that Yosef is born. After the nursing period is over, %0a> ZA ascends to AVI so as to receive from them the Light of Neshama, and this %0a> constitutes the state of Gadlut, called "Yosef." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 70 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA consists of three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY. The process of Zeir Anpin's %0a> growth, of acquiring a screen on his desires, begins with the purest, least egoistic %0a> part— Sefirot HBD, in which he first receives the Light of Nefesh. %0a> %0a> Afterwards, ZA acquires a screen on coarser egoistic desires— Sefirot HGT; %0a> the Light of Nefesh passes from HBD to HGT, and the Light of Ruach enters the %0a> empty HBD. %0a> %0a> Finally, ZA acquires a screen on the most egoistic Kelim— Sefirot NHY; the %0a> Light of Ne/esh passes from HGT to NHY, the Light of Ruach moves from HBD %0a> to the empty HGT, and the Light of Neshama enters the empty HBD. %0a> %0a> The attainment of the big state by ZA is called the birth of Yosef, for there %0a> emerge Sefirot NHY, of which the last Sefira, Yesod, is called "Yosef." However, %0a> since the Light of Haya is not yet present, this state is called "concealment." %0a> WHEN YOSEF ENTERED THE HOLY LAND AND ERECTED THEM %0a> THERE: that is, after the attainment of the first big state, the reception of the %0a> Light of Neshama, ZA continues to grow, cultivating his screen until the Light %0a> of Haya enters it. %0a> %0a> In such a state, Malchut of ZA separates from him into an independent %0a> Partzuf, called THE HOLY LAND, as the Light of Haya is called holiness. It %0a> is therefore said that Yosef entered or, rather, ASCENDED TO THE HOLY %0a> LAND in the Gadlut state of ZA. ZA and ~Nukva became equally big in the state %0a> of PBP (Panim be Panim, face to face), which is the state that determines the Zivug %0a> between ZON. %0a> %0a> AND YOSEF ERECTED THEM THERE: the Light of Haya or Hochma %0a> fills the Partzuf only during a Zivug, when ZON (ZA and Nukva) make a Zivug %0a> together. And this Light remains in Malchut, for only she (her screen) can %0a> reveal it. Just as AVI are GAR de Bina, YESHSLT is ZAT de Bina and the Light %0a> of Hochma is found only in YESHSLT, the relationship between Malchut and %0a> ZA works along the same principle, and the Light of Hochma is revealed only %0a> in Malchut. Therefore, only when the Light of Hochma fills Nu/cva can it be %0a> said that the Light has been revealed, and until that happens, it is considered %0a> to be concealed. %0a> %0a> WHEN ARE THEY SEEN? WHEN A RAINBOW CAN BE SEEN IN %0a> THE WORLD: ZA is called a "rainbow," the world is Malchut, and their union %0a> is called a "rainbow within a cloud." THE TIME HAS COME TO ERADICATE %0a> ALL THE WICKED FROM THE WORLD-as the number of the wicked grows, %0a> as more impure forces cling to ZON. The impure forces can influence ZON so %0a> greatly that the entire world will be brought to ruin, as has happened in the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Flower Buds %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 71 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> time of the Flood. If so, there is no salvation for man other than through the %0a> revelation of the Upper Light, the Light of Haya. That is why The Zohar tells us %0a> that the world is saved by the flower buds appearing from the earth, meaning %0a> that the Light of Haya eradicates man's impure forces from the earth (his desires, %0a> Malchut), and they cannot cling to her and hinder man. %0a> %0a> AND HAD THEY NOT APPEARED, THERE WOULD BE NO %0a> SALVATION FOR THE WORLD-for initially Nuba is built as big as ZA. %0a> This is called the "two great celestial bodies," when Malchut is on the same %0a> degree as ZA, but stands behind him, back to back, unable to receive the %0a> Light of Hochma in the absence of the Light of Hassadim. This is why Malchut %0a> complains about lacking the Light of Hassadim and thus not being able to %0a> receive the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> Even though the moon grows as big as the Sun, it cannot shine independently, %0a> but only if the Sun (ZA) gives it Light. And since Malchut lacks the Light of %0a> Hochma, such a state is called reversed (Achor-back). And a Zivug cannot take %0a> place in the position of back-to-back (Achor he Achor). %0a> %0a> However, after Nukva is born and grows (receives the properties) from the %0a> Guf of ZA, as it is written in the Torah (Beresheet 2) that Chava (Eve) was born %0a> from the body of Adam, she becomes equal to ZA and enters into a Zivug face- %0a> to-face (Panim he Panim, PBP) with him. %0a> %0a> Also, Nukva still retained the previous Light. Moreover, precisely because %0a> she felt the lack of the Light in her initial state, Malchut received the Light of %0a> Haya specifically into her previous sufferings. Similarly, man can feel pleasure %0a> only and precisely because of his previous suffering. %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar tells us that had the flower buds not appeared in %0a> Malchut during her Katnut, when she was standing behind ZA, she would not %0a> have been able to receive the Light of Haya in her state of Gadlut, as she would %0a> not have the Kelim (desires) to receive this Light. Every new creation is founded %0a> on the sensation of darkness, as it is said: the Creator emanates the Light out of %0a> Himself, and creates darkness out of nothingness. Man's sensation of darkness %0a> signifies his readiness to receive the Light. %0a> %0a> 6. Who sustains the world and evokes the revelation of the Patriarchs? It is the %0a> voice of the children engaged in the Torah. The world exists thanks to these %0a> children. Hence, it is said: "We will make for you pendants of gold" (Shir %0a> HaShirim, 1:11). These are the children, youngsters of the world, as it is said: %0a> "Make two cherubs of gold" (Shemot, 25:18). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 72 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Light of Ruach is called "the children of the world," and the Zivug in this %0a> state (PBA-face to back) is referred to as THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN %0a> ENGAGED IN THE TORAH. And it is also called "threads of gold" and %0a> "two cherubs of gold." Before Nukva grew, the impure forces had the power to %0a> destroy the world. However, precisely because Nukva grows from ZA, the right %0a> and left lines merge in her as one, the RAINBOW (right line) shines WITHIN %0a> A CLOUD (left line), and the Light of Haya can enter Malchut. Without this %0a> Light, the world can be destroyed as during (in the state of) the Flood. %0a> %0a> SO WHO IS IT THAT SUSTAINS THE WORLD: who causes the %0a> appearance of the Light of Hayal They are precisely the children engaged in %0a> the Torah. The "children" designate the Light of the opposite side, the Light %0a> of Ruach, the sensation of deficiency of the Light of Haya, for a "child" alludes %0a> to the process of nursing. The children of the house of Raban (Tinokot Shel Beit %0a> Raban)— are the Light of Haya, as the word "Raban" derives from "Rat/" (big, %0a> Haya). They did not transgress, i.e., did not use their AHP (egoistic and yet %0a> uncorrected desires, for the word "children" designates the small state), their %0a> will to receive. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes and you shall %0a> see, WHO HAS CREATED THESE" (Xeshayahu, 40:26). Raise your eyes %0a> where? To the place on which all eyes depend. Who is He? He is the One who %0a> opens eyes, Mcdchut de Rosh de Arich Anpin. And there you shall see that %0a> Atik is concealed and within it lies the answer to the question: WHO HAS %0a> CREATED THESE? WHO? MI, ZAT de Bina, the Highest Edge of Heaven, %0a> and everything depends on Him. And since the question lies in Him, and He %0a> is concealed, He is called MI. For MI is like when the question "Who?" is %0a> asked, as there are no questions above Him. The question is found only at the %0a> Highest Boundary of Heaven. %0a> %0a> In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes on high and look %0a> at who has created these." Raise your eyes to what place? To the place, where %0a> all eyes depend on Him. And who is He? He is the One who opens eyes. And %0a> there you shall know. It is the concealed Atik, within which lies the question: %0a> who has created these? And who is He? MI = who. He is called by the edge of the %0a> Supernal Heaven, where everything belongs to him. Since there lies a question, %0a> and He is on a concealed path and does not reveal Himself, He is called MI. %0a> And because there is no question Above, this edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a> %0a> In Hebrew, the word MI means the question "Who?" as well as the %0a> preposition "from." Since Kabbalah tells us about the property of our world's %0a> roots, one spiritual object can sometimes reveal an entire range of associations, %0a> properties, and categories. In the same way, here the word MI is a part of the %0a> word EloklM, where the last two letters form the word MI. However, at the same %0a> time, they carry a variety of additional charges and meanings. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Elazar wishes to explain how Heaven and earth were created. %0a> Naturally, just like the whole of the Torah, The Zohar refers only to spiritual %0a> degrees and categories, and does not deal with explanations of the physical %0a> %0a> 73 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 74 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> origin and development of our world. Moreover, it is impossible to understand %0a> the true origin and development of our world without attaining the spiritual %0a> world. However, whatever one does attain, he is unable to pass these attainments %0a> to others. Hence, even after he attains the full essence of our nature's origin %0a> and its actions, he will still be unable to describe it in a form that will be %0a> comprehensible to others. %0a> %0a> Heaven and earth constitute the seven days of Creation— ZON of the %0a> world of Atzilut. However, if it is a part of Atzilut, then why is it described as %0a> BARAH (created, from the word Beria) and not ATZIL (emanated, from the %0a> word Atzilut) 7 . Yet, precisely herein lies the opportunity to open our eyes to the %0a> process of creation. %0a> %0a> Rosh (head) de AA has only Keter and Hochma. Malchut standing below the %0a> eyes, below Sefira Hochma, is called "the opening of the eyes." After all, only %0a> when she opens up does the Light of Hochma pass through her from Rosh de AA %0a> to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said that the eyes should be raised up TO THE PLACE %0a> ON WHICH ALL EYES DEPEND, for the Light of Hochma can fill all the %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut only when Malchut opens up in Rosh de AA. %0a> Hence, the entire secret of the opening lies in Malchut. The Light of Hochma %0a> (the Light of Wisdom) is the Light of the eyes. It comes out of the eyes, and %0a> only in this Light can one see. %0a> %0a> The word BARAH signifies BAR (beyond), meaning outside the world %0a> of Atzilut. This is because Bina herself came out of the Rosh of AA and stood %0a> lower, outside the Rosh of AA, giving birth to, that is, precisely BARAH %0a> (creating) ZON. %0a> %0a> In Hebrew, every notion has several possible names that determine the %0a> specific action that takes place. Here, the birth of ZON occurred by means %0a> of Bina's exit and descent from her degree; hence, the birth of ZON is called %0a> BARAH, from the word BAR - outside (of one's degree). %0a> %0a> The entire creation consists of only ten Sefirot. Yet, since every Sefira includes %0a> all the others, and since all of them are interconnected, every world, degree, %0a> or Sefira includes the properties of all the others, and consists of their parts. %0a> Therefore, every Sefira consists of Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut, each of %0a> which in turn consists of five. In all, 5x5x5 = 125 Sefirot or steps of the ladder %0a> that separate us (the lowest) from the Creator (the highest). %0a> %0a> The property of Bina herself is not to receive the Light of Hochma. Yet, in %0a> order to pass the Light of Hochma to ZA and Malchut, who desire to receive it for %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 75 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the Creator's sake, since receiving the Light of Hochma is the goal of creation, %0a> Bina allocates within herself a certain part called ZAT de Bina or YESHSUT, %0a> which receives the Light of Hochma from Partzuf Hochma and passes it to ZON. %0a> The main part, Bina herself, is called GAR de Bina. The part of Bina that receives %0a> the Light of Hochma is called ZAT de Bina. %0a> %0a> Therefore, if Bina exits the Rosh and falls into the Guf, as it occurs in the %0a> second restriction, this has no effect on Bina herself, for she does not suffer %0a> from lack of the Light of Hochma whatsoever, as though she had never left the %0a> Rosh. This refers only to the Upper part of Bina, GAR de Bina, which has no %0a> desire for Hochma. This part is called AVI, and it spans from the Peh (mouth) %0a> down to the Chazeh (chest) of AA. %0a> %0a> However, ZAT de Bina, which wants to receive Hochma for ZON, just as a %0a> mother who wants to receive for her children, feels the exit from the Rosh of AA %0a> to its Guf, for there it cannot receive the Light of Hochma, but only the Light %0a> of Ruach-Nefesh, VAK of the Light. This part of Bina is called YESHSUT, and it %0a> spans from the Chazeh down to Tahur of AA. %0a> %0a> ZON of the world of Atzilut, which receive from YESHSUT, span from Tahur %0a> to the end of the feet of AA, on the Parsa. Thus, there are two Parsaot (plural for %0a> Parsa): one is in the world of Atzilut, separating the Sefirot of "bestowal" (GE) %0a> from the Sefirot of "reception" (AHP). This Parsa is located at the chest of AA. %0a> The second Parsa is located between Atzilut and BYA. However, we can also say %0a> that every Partzuf has its own Parsa, which separates the desires of bestowal from %0a> the desires of reception. %0a> %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT = ZAT de Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVI = GAR de Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> PehH %0a> %0a> Rosh %0a> Peh— I- Chazeh- %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Chazeh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Tabur %0a> Raglaim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raglaim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> of the World %0a> of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yetzira %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This World %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Machsom %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 76 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Although GAR de Bina are positioned below the Rosh of AA, they are %0a> considered not to have left it, as they do not feel it, that is, they do not want %0a> Hochma; they wish only to bestow, and he who wants only to bestow feels %0a> perfection wherever he is. All the Partzufim and their parts that have nothing %0a> to do with reception of Hochma (Keter, Hochma, and GAR de Bina) separate %0a> themselves with a Parsa from the remaining parts of the world of Atzilut that %0a> want Hochma (ZAT de Bina and ZON). %0a> %0a> The "existence of the question" that The Zohar speaks of signifies the %0a> sensation of the lack of Light of Hochma, the desire for it. This is felt by ZON, %0a> which is why they raise MAN. MAN is a request of the lower one to receive %0a> the Light of Hochma from the Upper One for the Creator's sake. It is called %0a> a "question," for a question is similar to prayer or request. The Zohar tells us %0a> that the question exists only in YESHSUT, meaning that it receives MAN from %0a> below, from ZON. %0a> %0a> And before that, it is said of YESHSUT: BARAH (from the word Beria = BAR), %0a> something that exists outside of its degree. What did it do? BARAH (created) %0a> ELEH (AHP, ZON). However, it created them as headless as itself. For the word %0a> BARAH (beyond) indicates the lack of a Rosh (Kelim of the world of Atzilut). %0a> %0a> ZAT de Bina that wait for an "answer to their question," for the Light of %0a> Hochma, are called MI. It is said BARAH in regards to them because they exited %0a> and descended independently from the level of the Rosh de AA to below its %0a> Chazeh. These are ZAT de Bina, called YESHSUT or MI, the "Highest Edge of %0a> Heaven," for Heaven refers to ZA, who receives from YESHSUT. Malchut is %0a> called "earth." %0a> %0a> ZAT de Bina is called "firmament." %0a> %0a> ZA is called "Heaven." %0a> %0a> Malchut is called "earth." %0a> %0a> All that exists below YESHSUT (ZON and the worlds of BYA) receives from %0a> it. Hence, it is considered that YESHSUT revives the whole of creation: whatever %0a> it has, they will receive it, too. However, their MAN determines whether or not %0a> YESHSUT will have something to bestow upon them. %0a> %0a> THERE LIES NO QUESTION in GAR de Bina (AVI). They do not receive %0a> MAN for the reception of Hochma, and they never feel any lack of Hochma, %0a> neither for themselves nor so as to give to others. Only ZATde Bina or YESHSUT %0a> are created and exist for the question, for the reception of MAN (ZON's plea). %0a> YESHSUT raises MAN that is received from ZON to the Rosh of AA and receives %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 77 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the Light of Hochma from there. YESHSLT is called the "Highest Edge of %0a> Heaven," for ZA, called "Heaven," receives from it. %0a> %0a> 8. But there is another one below, called MA. What is in common between %0a> this one and that one? The first one is concealed and is called MI. There exists %0a> a question in it for man to inquire and research in order to see and know all %0a> the degrees, down to the end of all degrees, which is Malchut. That is MA. %0a> What does MA mean? MA (what) do you know? What do you see? What do %0a> you research? After all, everything is initially concealed. %0a> %0a> Being in a state of Zivug PBP with ZA, Malchut is also called MA (like ZA) and %0a> is considered the lowest edge of Heaven, for she concludes all the degrees and %0a> Atzilut. ZA, called "Heaven," stands between Malchut (lowest edge of Heaven) %0a> and YESHSLT (Highest Edge of Heaven). %0a> %0a> MAN MUST INQUIRE, SEE, RESEARCH-only if one who is below %0a> ZON raises MAN (his prayer) to ZON will they raise this MAN higher. For ZON %0a> themselves are corrected by the Light of Hassadim, and do not want to receive %0a> the Light of Hochma. And only if a request comes from below, from man, will %0a> ZON ascend to YESHSLT and ask for the Light of Hochma. YESHSLT proceeds %0a> to raise MAN to AVI, and AVI raise MAN to AA: AVI ascend to the Rosh of AA, %0a> where there is the Light of Hochma, where they make a Zivug on this Light. %0a> %0a> A Zivug of AVI is called "Aha and Ima looking at each other." To "look" %0a> means to receive the Light of Hochma (to "hear" means to receive the Light of %0a> Hassadim). As a result of AVI's ascent to the Rosh of AA, Bina starts receiving %0a> Hochma for ZON. All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are corrected by the %0a> Light of Hassadim in such a way that they do not want to receive the Light of %0a> Hochma for themselves. %0a> %0a> He who is able to raise his request (MAN) to compel ZON to ascend to %0a> YESHS LT, whereupon YESHS LT and AVI will ascend to the Rosh of AA together %0a> so as to receive the Light for him— such a person is not simply considered a mere %0a> "person," but a "righteous"! %0a> %0a> The request that one raises to ZON is called one's "soul," for a soul is a %0a> vessel, a desire filled with Light. However, the Light inside a vessel is determinec %0a> by the desire. Hence, the spiritual desire, the intention to act for the Creator's %0a> sake is called "a soul." Naturally, if one does not yet have such an intention, he %0a> ot have a soul. %0a> %0a> The spiritual world is a world of only desires without any corporea %0a> hells. The reader must revise his ideas about the soul, body, connections %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 78 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> >rlds, etc., and correct himself continually so as to properly in %0a> ategories. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> So then, man's corrected desires are called "the souls of the righteous." %0a> These souls of the righteous ascend to ZON in the form of MAN and compel %0a> ZON to ascend to YESHSUT. The presence of ZON creates in YESHSUT a %0a> desire to receive the Light of Hochma. This compels YESHSUT (ZAT de Bina) to %0a> ascend to the Rosh of AA and there join with GAR de Bina (AVI) into one Partzuf. %0a> And then AVI (AB + SAG = AA + AVI) look at each other, exchange the Light of %0a> Hochma between them, and pass it down to ZON. %0a> %0a> Without a request from below, AVI will be satisfied with the Light of %0a> Hassadim and will not "look" at one another. Only the request of their children %0a> (ZON) compels AVI to face each other (Panim be Panim) and make a Zivug. In %0a> this Zivug, Ima-Bina receives the Light of Hochma for the children, ZON, from %0a> Aha-Hochma. %0a> %0a> However, this occurs BECAUSE MAN INQUIRED-man's question %0a> signifies the raising of MAN so as to make AVI look at each other, make a Zivug %0a> together, and let Ima receive Hochma from Aha for the man that is elevating his %0a> soul. The descending Light of Hochma is called knowledge or wisdom (Daat), %0a> for ZON ascend to YESHSUT + AVI, and there stimulate a Zivug on the Light %0a> of Hochma, called "knowledge." Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And Adam %0a> came to know his wife." %0a> %0a> Thus, to COME TO KNOW means to receive the Light of Hochma. ZON %0a> that stand in AVI and compel AVI to receive the Light of Hochma are called Daat %0a> (knowledge) or the Sefira Daat. %0a> %0a> Yet, Daat is not an additional Sefira. There are only ten Sefirot. However, in %0a> order to designate the fact that ZON's request for the Light of Hochma is inside %0a> the ten Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, we say that AVI have a Sefira called Daat. In this case, %0a> instead of the regular count of Sefirot: KHB-HGT-NHYM, we count the Sefirot: %0a> HBD-HGT-NHYM. The Sefira Keter is omitted, and we only mention the Sefira %0a> Daat after HochmaAba and Bina-lma. FROM ONE DEGREE TO ANOTHER %0a> signifies the passing of the Light of Hochma from the Sefira Daat of the degree of %0a> AVI to the degree of ZA. And TO THE END OF ALL DEGREES-from ZA to %0a> Malchut, which is called "the end of all degrees." %0a> %0a> When the Light is present in Nukva, she is called MA, and the Light that she %0a> passes to the lower ones is called 100 blessings. There are several states in Nukva, %0a> Malchut of the world of At^ilut. We need to know them, for all that we receive, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 79 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> we receive from her alone. In addition to all stages of growth from a point to a %0a> full Partzuf, a grown Malchut has two big states. %0a> %0a> Malchut attains the first big state when she receives the Light of Neshama. %0a> This occurs when, due to her MAN, AVI ascend one degree from their %0a> permanent place to the Rosh of AA. However, although YESHSUT ascends from %0a> its permanent place between the chest (Chazeh) and the navel (Tabur) of AA to %0a> where AVI used to be (between the mouth and the chest of AA), it still remains %0a> clothed onto the Guf of AA, even though it merges into one Partzuf with AVI. %0a> %0a> And since YESHSUT now clothes the place from the mouth (Peh) to the %0a> Chazeh of AA from the outside, YESHSUT becomes like the Rosh of AA, as it %0a> merged with AVI in the Rosh of AA as one Partzuf. Also, YESHSUT ascends from %0a> under the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA and stands above it, where the %0a> Rosh of AA shines. %0a> %0a> That is why YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma to ZA, and ZA passes %0a> it on to Malchut, who fills herself with this Light, called "100 blessings," for, %0a> having received this Light, ZON can ascend to the permanent place of YESHSUT %0a> between the Chazeh and the Tabur of AA. %0a> %0a> By ascending to this degree, Malchut becomes like Ima. In the spiritual %0a> world, the degree of a spiritual object determines all of its properties. Even %0a> in our world, the degree of man's inner development alone determines his %0a> properties, thoughts, and desires. And since Ima equals 100, Malchut, too, is %0a> called "100," so as to emphasize the fact that Malchut ascended to Bina of the %0a> world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> Now Malchut is similar to MI just as YESHSUT was prior to raising MAN and %0a> passing the Light. This is because she now clothes the place of the small state of %0a> YESHSUT from the Chazeh to the Tabur of AA, and stands under the Parsa of the %0a> world of Atzilut, below which the Light from the Rosh de AA cannot pass. %0a> %0a> That is why Malchut gained no Light, for the sake of which she had raised %0a> MAN. Nevertheless, Malchut gains by receiving the properties of Ima-Bina, for %0a> she ascended to YESHSUT, called Ima. %0a> %0a> Hence, the Light that Malchut received is only considered VAK of the Gadlut %0a> state, the first state of Gadlut. Malchut will not be able to receive the GAR of %0a> Gadlut, the second Gadlut, the Light of Hochma (Haya), as long as she is under %0a> the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA. (How Malchut receives GAR of the %0a> Gadlut is explained in items 11 through 15 in the next article). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 80 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar calls Nukva that ascended to YESHSUT by the word MA (from %0a> the word Me'ah— 100), for by means of this ascent, Malchut gained the properties %0a> of Bina—100 blessings. And she gained the sensation of the question— she feels %0a> that it has only VAK (a half, a part of the big state). Put differently, she feels the %0a> desire for its second half, GAR. Nevertheless, she gained a part of the big state, %0a> VAK of AVI. %0a> %0a> Thus, Nukva became like YESHSUT before it raised MAN, but gained the %0a> properties of Bina, 100 blessings. And since this is VAK of the Light of the big %0a> state, she feels a deficiency (a question), just as YESHSUT felt prior to raising %0a> MAN— at its place, when YESHSUT was in the Katnut state. When it ascended %0a> to AVI, AVI ascended to AA, and ZON ascended to the place of YESHSUT AVI %0a> shine from the Rosh of AA on the place of YESHSUT ZON that stand there now %0a> feel the Light that they receive from AVI, and realize that this is merely a part of %0a> the Light, which generates another question within them. %0a> %0a> 9. This is the secret defined by the word MA: WHAT do you testify and %0a> WHAT is equal to you? When the Temple was destroyed, a voice came forth %0a> and said, "What (MA) shall I indicate to you, and what (MA) shall I equate %0a> to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). However, here MA means, "What is the covenant, %0a> testimony, what (MA) is equal to you?" For every day testifies to you the days %0a> of past, as it is said: "This day I call onto Heaven and earth to witness for you" %0a> (Devarim, 30:19). WHAT is equal to you? It is said: "I adorned you with holy %0a> adornments and made you ruler of the world." And it is said: "Is this the %0a> city that men called the quintessence of beauty?" {Eicha, 2:15). I have called %0a> you, "Jerusalem, a city rebuilt by me" (Tehilim, 122:3). "What shall I equate %0a> to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). Just as you sit here, so He sits Above in Supernal %0a> Jerusalem. Just as the holy nation does not enter into you, so I swear to you %0a> that I will not enter Above until I enter you down below. And this is your %0a> consolation— that I will equate you with this degree, with Supernal Jerusalem, %0a> which is the Supernal Malchut (Hebrew - Kingdom) that rules over all. But %0a> for now you are here, and "Your misery is great, like the sea" (Eicha, 2:13). %0a> And if you say that there is no existence or salvation for you, then WHO (MI) %0a> shall heal you (not Who? with a question mark, but the Upper Force called %0a> WHO is what will heal you), that is, that same concealed Upper Degree, which %0a> is called MI, Bina that revives all, shall heal and revive you. %0a> %0a> In other words, MA and MI, besides being translated as WHAT and WHO, %0a> also designate the names of spiritual objects that perform actions described %0a> in The Zohar. The destruction of the Temple was the consequence of Israel's %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 81 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> transgression of egoistic reception, because they did not want to raise MAN %0a> for the Zivug of ZON, and instead wished to receive the Light into the impure %0a> forces, their egoistic desires, called "other gods" (Elokim Acherim). There is %0a> only one Creator. %0a> %0a> There is but one property for the Creator, and we know it— the property %0a> of bestowal. Drawing closer to this property is defined as working "for the %0a> Creator's sake." Any other desire can only mean distancing from this property %0a> and from the Creator, for except for this property or its opposite (rather, its %0a> absence), nothing else exists in creation. Hence, man's inner movement towarc %0a> the property of "reception" pushes him away from the Creator, and is there %0a> called "worshipping other gods." As a result, ZON stopped their Zivug, the %0a> blessings disappeared from Nukva, and the Temple was ruined. %0a> %0a> The First Temple— Malchut ascended to AVI and there receives the Light of %0a> Haya. Its ruin is the fall of Malchut to the level of reception of the Light GAR %0a> de Ruach. %0a> %0a> The Second Temple is Malchut 's ascension to YESHSUT and the reception %0a> of the Light of Neshama. In its ruin, Malchut fell to the level of reception of the %0a> Light of Nefesh in her Sefira Keter, while the other nine Sefirot fall below the %0a> Parsa. Such a state is called Galut— exile from the spiritual, from the world of %0a> Atzilut. The single Sefira Malchut in the world of Atzilut remains as a point below %0a> the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a> %0a> ZA is called "six days" and Malchut is called Shahhat (Saturday). Yet, is Malchut %0a> really bigger than ZA, as Shahhat is bigger (higher) than weekdays? The worlds %0a> of BYA, including our world, receive the Light, their life-force, from Malchut. %0a> The "six weekdays" are a state of ZON when ZA and Malchut are unconnected %0a> to one another. Shabbat is a state of ZON when Malchut joins with ZA, a Zivug %0a> takes place between them, and Malchut receives the Light from ZA and passes it %0a> on to the whole world. %0a> %0a> Since the state of Malchut when she passes the Light received from ZA down %0a> to the world is important to us, by measuring our states in accordance with what %0a> we receive from Malchut, we define the extent of maximal reception as Shahhat. %0a> (Naturally, this has nothing to do with our calendar: weekdays and Shabbat are %0a> spiritual states that transcend time). %0a> %0a> AND A VOICE CAME FORTH AND SAID: "EACH AND EVERY DAY %0a> MY COVENANT HAS BEEN IN YOU SINCE THE DAYS OF PAST"- %0a> here, The Zohar speaks of the Light of VAK that ZON receive in the state of %0a> Gadlut, which Nukva receives as MA. This Light is called "the past days" (Yamim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 82 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kadmonim). Therefore, it is written in the Torah (Devarim, 4:32): "Ask now of %0a> the past days, which were before you, since the day the Creator created man, %0a> from one edge of Heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing %0a> as great as this?..." %0a> %0a> The Light of VAK of the Gadlut state is called in ZON "the past days," for %0a> it is VAK of AVI. YESHSUT is ZAT of AVI. ZAT is an abbreviation of the words %0a> Zayin (7), and Tachtonot (lower, meaning the lower Sefirot). ZAT of AVI, meaning %0a> the seven Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, is YESHSUT. These Zayin are seven days, the %0a> seven primary Sefirot of AVI with regard to Zayin, the seven days or the seven %0a> Sefirot of ZON. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written, "MY COVENANT EACH AND EVERY DAY BY %0a> HEAVEN AND EARTH" (Devarim, 4:26). These words of the Torah speak of %0a> the Zivug of ZON called "Heaven" (ZA) and "earth" (Nukva). "The past days" %0a> or "Supernal Days" constitute YESHSUT, and "the low days" or "the present %0a> days" are ZON. %0a> %0a> In this sentence, the Creator cautions that the Zivug of ZON needs to be %0a> constantly realized and maintained. Otherwise, the Creator warns that "you will %0a> disappear from the earth." And this is the meaning of the Creator's warning %0a> about the 100 blessings: they should be guarded and constantly created. %0a> %0a> For these 100 blessings that Nukva receives from ZA every day in the Zivug of %0a> MA between them take place during the ascent of ZON to YESHSUT, when ZA %0a> becomes like YeshS (Israel-Saba) and Nukva becomes like T (Tvunah). YESHSUT %0a> stands for Israel-Saba and Tvunah. And then, the Light that Nukva receives from %0a> ZA becomes 100 blessings, like the Light in Tvunah. %0a> %0a> It is said about it, "the city that united with her," for Nukva, called "city," %0a> merged with Tvunah, and Nukva became like Tvunah. And Nukva receives in %0a> Tvunah the Light oi Tvunah, called "holy adornments," and then, like a crown of %0a> beauty, she surrounds the earth and receives power over the earth. %0a> %0a> However, as a result of Israel's transgressions (the rise of impure desires %0a> over the pure ones), the Temple is ruined (the Light disappeared), and Israel %0a> is banished from its land (fell to lower degrees). This led to the distancing of %0a> Nukva (all creatures) from ZA (the Creator), for the lower nine Sefirot (desires) of %0a> Nukva fell to the impure forces (became egoistic). In other words, the nine pure, %0a> altruistic desires (forces) lost their screen and became egoistic, and Nukva herself %0a> turned into a point that stands below the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written: "WHO SHALL REBUILD YOU AND HEAL YOU"- %0a> if the sons of Israel return in their aspirations to the Creator (to altruism), called %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 83 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> "the return," correct their deeds (desires), and raise their prayers (MAN) for help %0a> in their correction to the Creator in ZON, they will once more be able to receive %0a> the Upper Light in ZON, Nukva will rise again to YESHSUT, called MI, and will %0a> be healed thereby (the Upper Light will enter Malchut, the souls, and will impart %0a> its properties onto them). %0a> %0a> 10. MI-WHO sets the boundary of Heaven Above— YESHSUT. MA- %0a> WHAT sets the boundary of Heaven below— ZA and Malchut. And this is %0a> what Yaakov inherited, as he is ZA that shines from end to end. From one %0a> boundary, which is MI, to the other boundary, which is MA. For he, Yaakov, %0a> stands in the middle, between YESHSUT and Malchut. Hence, it is said, %0a> MI BARAH ELEH: MI is YESHSUT, BARAH means created, and ELEH %0a> stands for ZA and Malchut. %0a> %0a> Actually, it should rather be written, "from the beginning, i.e., from the %0a> Height of Heaven down to its end (lowest point) below." Yet it says, "from the %0a> boundary of Heaven." MI is YESHSUT that upholds everything with its question, %0a> the desire to receive the Light for ZON. MA is Nulcva. Before Nulcva raises MAN, %0a> she is the very last degree, standing below the Chazeh of ZA. Between YESHSUT %0a> and Nulcva stands Yaakov— ZA that clothes AA from Tabur to Malchut of AA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Creator %0a> %0a> The World of AK %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> (Atik inside of AA is unattainable) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> of the World %0a> of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 9 %0a> %0a> lower %0a> Sefirot %0a> of Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The World of Beria %0a> The World of Yetzira %0a> The World of Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> of the Worlds %0a> ABYA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This World %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 84 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Arich Anpin is the central Partzuf in the world of Atzilut. Since Atik is %0a> unattainable, everything comes from AA, and all the Partzufim of the world of %0a> Atzilut clothe it (receive from it): Rosh de AA towers over all, and no one can %0a> clothe it, meaning no one can attain its thoughts and reasons for its actions. %0a> %0a> The next Partzuf is AVI. AVI clothe (attain) AA from Peh to Chazeh. Below AVI %0a> stands Partzuf YESHSUT, clothing AA from Chazeh to Tahur. ZA stands below %0a> YESHSLT and clothes AA from Tahur downwards. Partzuf ZA is incomplete, as %0a> he has only six Sefirot HBD-HGT or VAK; he is in the Katnut state, ending with %0a> his Sefira Tifferet (his Chazeh). %0a> %0a> Nukm (Malchut) stands below ZA, or parallel to his last Sefira Tifferet (the %0a> Chazeh of ZA). She has only one Sefira Keter, whereas her nine other Sefirot %0a> fell below the Parsa to the worlds BYA. The entire world of Atzilut ends at %0a> the Chazeh of ZA, where the single Sefira of Malchut stands, who is therefore %0a> called a point. %0a> %0a> In our world, there is desire and its physical manifestation— action. For %0a> example, one wants to receive something, but he does not allow himself to %0a> perform the physical act of taking. Meanwhile, his desire to take remains the %0a> same. In the spiritual world, there are no bodies, only bare desires. Therefore, %0a> the desire itself already constitutes action, like an already completed mental %0a> and physical action in our world. Therefore, the desire alone determines man's %0a> spiritual state. %0a> %0a> Just imagine what it would be like if in our world we judged a person not by %0a> his actions, but by his desires! It is terrifying to think how distant we are from %0a> spiritual demands. However, our desires are determined by our spiritual degree. %0a> And The Zohar explains that only by raising MAN (the request for correctic %0a> can we attract onto us the flow of Upper Light, which will correct and elevate %0a> to a Higher Degree. And we will immediately begii %0a> that degree will evoke within us. %0a> %0a> Therefore, our task is to attain the desire for correction. To this end, we %0a> need a "question," perception of our state as intolerable. This is called the %0a> realization of evil, i.e., that our egoism is evil, that it brings me harm by severing %0a> me from the spiritual. %0a> %0a> However, in order for this to happen, we need %0a> little bit of what the spiritual is and how good it is. Evil %0a> contrast with good. Yet, how can we sense the spiritual if we have yet to %0a> egoism? In what Kelim (desires) can we sense this? Even though we lack corrected %0a> desires, and therefore cannot sense the spiritual, as a result of studying Kabbalah, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 85 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> one begins to sense the Surrounding Light, which bestows onto him the desire %0a> for the spiritual (See "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a> %0a> The desire of one who physically exists in our world, but spiritually exists %0a> in the worlds of BYA— is a desire to enjoy the Light. However, opposite these %0a> desires one has an "anti-desire," a screen, which neutralizes his innate will to %0a> receive pleasure. %0a> %0a> A screen is created (appears, emerges, born) within the Kli (desire, man) as a %0a> result of man's sensation of the spiritual Light (the Creator). Therefore, all our %0a> requests (prayers, MAN, "questions") should be about one thing only: for the %0a> Creator to grant us the strength necessary to ascend spiritually, to transform our %0a> desires or, as Kabbalah defines it, to acquire a screen. It is impossible to annul %0a> one's will to receive pleasure. The Creator created it, and it is His only creation. %0a> All we can do is acquire a screen (counterbalance) on it, thereby ascending above %0a> creation (egoism), and become similar to the Creator! And to the extent of this %0a> similarity, to merge with him. %0a> %0a> Thus, Partzuf Yaakov stands from MI (YESHSUT) to MA (Malchut), from %0a> end to end. However, what is referred to here is the state of ZON, when they %0a> ascend to YESHSUT and receive the Light of its degree. %0a> %0a> The entire spiritual distance from us to the Creator is divided into 125 %0a> invisible degrees, all of them named. These degrees differ from one another %0a> only by the magnitude of their screen on man's egoistic desires. Man receives %0a> the Light in his corrected, altruistic desires. The volume of the received Light %0a> depends on the screen's magnitude (the size of the desire's corrected part). %0a> %0a> Every degree is characterized by a particular sensation of the Creator, and %0a> this sensation is called Light. Hence, we can designate the spiritual state of the %0a> Kli (man) in the spiritual world by the name of its degree or the name of the %0a> Light it receives, as every degree has its own particular Light. These gradations of %0a> the sensation of the Creator are precisely what we call spiritual degrees. %0a> %0a> That is why, having ascended to a degree called YESHSUT, ZON receive %0a> the Light of YESHSUT, although Partzuf YESHSUT itself ascended, accordingly, %0a> to a Higher Degree, and there receives the Light of that degree, called AVI. In %0a> turn, AVI ascend to a degree called AA, where they receive the Light of AA. We %0a> call degrees by the names of the Partzufim that abide there in their usual, lowest %0a> state. Such a state is called permanent. %0a> %0a> Even though by ascending to a Higher Degree, the lower Partzuf receives %0a> the Light of that degree, which changes its properties, the Partzuf remains itself %0a> nonetheless, just as a person who acquires new properties remains a person, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 86 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> though now one of another level. Therefore, when it is said, "having ascended %0a> to the Upper One, the lower one becomes like him," it implies a change only in %0a> the inner properties of man (or Partzuf), but not in his identity. %0a> %0a> Upon ascending to YESHSUT, ZA receives greater Light, for an ascent %0a> in the spiritual world signifies an increase in the magnitude of a screen, and, %0a> accordingly, reception of greater Light. That is to say, ZA himself grew, but did %0a> not turn into YESHSUT: previously, at his own place, he had only the Light %0a> Ruach-Nefesh, but upon ascending and acquiring a screen, he receives the Light %0a> of Neskama as well. %0a> %0a> Therefore, all the places between us and the Creator are established, and %0a> the Partzufim that are there "stand" on them in their permanent place. However, %0a> all the Partzufim and the worlds can ascend relative to their permanent, lowest %0a> states by one, two, or three degrees. In its lowest state, a Partzuf has only GE and %0a> no AHP, and only the Light of Nefesh-Ruach. %0a> %0a> By receiving the Light of correction from Above, the Partzuf can gradually %0a> correct its AHP: it corrects the Sefira Bina and receives the Light of Neshama, %0a> which designates an ascent of one degree. After that, the Partzuf corrects %0a> the Sefira ZA, and receives the Light of Haya, which designates an ascent %0a> to another degree, i.e., already two degrees. And after that, it corrects Sefira %0a> Malchut and receives the Light of Yechida, which designates an ascent to yet %0a> another degree, a third one. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma = Eynaim %0a> Parsa, Nikvey Eynaim, Masach of Partzuf %0a> %0a> Bina = Awzen ( ascen t of Bina to GE = ascent by 1 degree) %0a> ZA =Hotem (ascent of ZA to GE = ascent by 2 degrees) %0a> Malchut = Peh (ascent of Malchut to GE = ascent by 3 degrees) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> However, the new Light does not enter the just corrected Kli (Sefira), but %0a> comes from Above and enters through the Sefira Keter. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 87 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIRA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LIGHT %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> l« %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Man's spiritual ascent can be the consequence of two factors: %0a> %0a> 1. An awakening of a desire from Above, called "special days"— holidays, %0a> new moons, Sabbaths. This kind of an ascent is called "an awakening %0a> from Above," and leads to the general ascent of all the worlds ABYA, %0a> and, consequently, of all that inhabits them. %0a> %0a> 2. Man's efforts in his studies and inner work, his prayer to merit the Cre- %0a> ator personally giving him the strength to ascend to a Higher Degree. %0a> %0a> Moreover, such an ascent is not limited to only three degrees, but can elevate %0a> man along all 125 degrees to the Creator Himself. Ascension to the Highest %0a> Degree is precisely the purpose for which man was created. He must accomplish %0a> this task while still living in this world. And until he attains this goal, he will %0a> have to return to this world again and again. %0a> %0a> Although ZON are called "the last days," upon ascending and receiving the %0a> Light of YESHSLT, they receive the name "the days past or first days." In this %0a> instance, one boundary of Heaven (Malchut or MA) ascends and clothes the %0a> other boundary of Heaven (YESHSUT or MI). MA and MI merge in one, and %0a> The Zohar emphasizes that fact. AND KNOW: %0a> %0a> Ml - WHO %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> BARAH - CREATED %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ELEH - THIS %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 88 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> MI is YESHSUT that stands in the place of Bina de AA, from Chazeh to Tabur %0a> de AA. And although only Kelim of GE (vessels of bestowal) are present in the %0a> world of Atzilut, there are Partzufirn among them that wish only to "bestow": %0a> Atik, AA, AVI, and those that want to receive for the sake of bestowal, so as to %0a> pass the Light on to YESHSUT and ZON. %0a> %0a> World of Atzilut %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> AA > These 3 Partzufirn form GE of the World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> YESHSUT %0a> %0a> ZA ) These 3 Partzufirn form AHP of the World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT and ZON want to receive the Light so as to pass it to the souls of %0a> the righteous, the people who seek correction. Hence, within the world of Atzilut %0a> there is a division into two types of Kelim— GE and AHP. They are separated from %0a> each other by the Parsa of the world of Atzilut that stands in the Chazeh of AA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AA %0a> Rosh %0a> -Peh — %0a> %0a> Chazeh - %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> -Tabur — %0a> Raglaim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> of the World %0a> of Atzilut %0a> %0a> Parsa between %0a> Atzilut and the %0a> Worlds BYA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Light from the Rosh de AA does not pass below the Parsa of the world of %0a> Atzilut. Therefore, YESHSUT in its permanent state, or ZON, when they ascend %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 89 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to YESHSUT, cannot receive the Light of Rosh de AA. This is why they have the %0a> desire to receive the Light of Hochma, called "question." The question (desire %0a> to receive the Light of Hochma) therefore amounts to MI (YESHSUT, the Light %0a> of YESHSUT), which is BARAH (beyond ELEH-ZON), and upon their ascent, %0a> ZON do not receive the Light of Hochma, as they are outside the Rosh of AA, %0a> outside of the Light of Hochma, but with a question (a desire for it). This enables %0a> them to continue their ascent. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 11. Rabbi Shimon said: "Elazar, my son, reveal the supernal secret, which %0a> the dwellers of this world know nothing about." Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a> Rabbi Shimon wept and paused for a moment, and then said, "Elazar, what %0a> is ELEH?" If you say that they are like the stars and the signs of the zodiac %0a> (destiny), are they not always visible (unlike the changeable signs of destiny)? %0a> And in MA, that is in Malchut, they were created as it is written, "By the %0a> word of the Creator were the Heavens made" (Tehilim, 33:6), meaning that %0a> the Heavens were made by Mcdchut, called the Creator's word. And if ELEH %0a> speak of the hidden secrets, then there would be no need to write ELEH, as %0a> the stars and the signs of destinies are visible to all (the word ELEH (THIS) %0a> tells us that something is clear). %0a> %0a> Rabbi Elazar did not reveal the reception of the Light of the first Gadlut %0a> state (Ohr Neshama), and Rabbi Shimon wished to reveal the way to receive the %0a> Light of the second Gadlut state (Ohr Haya). Therefore, he asked Rabbi Elazar %0a> to speak and to reveal the way to attain Ohr Neshama, which is concealed from %0a> people by a supernal secret, for this Light has not yet been revealed in the world, %0a> and Rabbi Shimon reveals it here. %0a> %0a> The fact is that, although there were righteous who attained the Light of %0a> Haya, there was no one among them who could explain the path of its attainment %0a> in detail, no one who could reveal it to the entire world. This is so because to %0a> understand means to attain, to ascend to that degree, which depends only on %0a> man's efforts. While there were many people throughout the generations who %0a> attained the degree of ELEH, revealing it to the world requires an even greater %0a> degree, and a special permission by the Creator (See the article The Conditions %0a> for Disclosing the Secrets of the Wisdom of Kabbalah). %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon asked him what ELEH means, what new things is the Torah %0a> telling us with the words, MI BARAH ELEH (WHO CREATED THESE), where %0a> %0a> 91 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 92 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the word ELEH designates ZON? After all, if it speaks of the stars and the signs %0a> of the zodiac— luck, which signify the Light of VAK of the big state, then what %0a> is so special about it? After all, ZON can receive this Light even on weekdays. %0a> There is nothing so extraordinary in this to mention MI - WHO CREATED %0a> THIS separately. %0a> %0a> (One might say that this Light is constant, for only the Light of VAK is %0a> constantly present in ZON, but not GAR. And only as a result of MAN does %0a> ZON receive the Light of VAK of the big state, the Light of Neshama. The answer %0a> lies in that this Light can be received at any time, even on weekdays during the %0a> morning prayer. However, he still does not understand why these were created %0a> in MA. After all, Light refers not to Bina, but to the ZON of the world of At^ilut, %0a> called MA, and exits them, as is written BY THE WORD OF THE CREATOR, %0a> where the Creator is ZA and His word is Malchut.) %0a> %0a> 12. However, this secret was revealed on another day, when I was on the %0a> seashore. The prophet Eliyahu came to me and said: "Rabbi, do you know %0a> the meaning of MI BARAH ELEH - WHO HAS CREATED THESE?" I %0a> answered: "These are the Heavens and its forces, the works of the Creator, %0a> looking at which, people should bless Him, as it is said, 'When I behold Your %0a> Heavens, the work of Your hands' (Tehilim, 8:4), and 'O LORD! Our Lord! %0a> How glorious is Your name throughout all the earth!'" (Tehilim, 8:10). %0a> %0a> 13. He replied to me: "Rabbi, the Creator took the concealed and revealed it %0a> to the Celestial Council. And here it is: When the most Concealed of all that %0a> are Concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made a single point, which %0a> is Mcdchut, and it ascended to His Thought, that is, into Bina, meaning that %0a> MalcHwt ascended and merged with Bina. In her, He shaped all the creatures, %0a> and in her confirmed all the laws." %0a> %0a> Atilc is the first Partzuf and the Rosh of the world of Atzilut. And it is called %0a> the most concealed and secret of all the Partzufim, and its name— Atilc (from the %0a> word Ne'etok— isolated, unattainable) testifies to that fact. No one can attain %0a> this Partzuf in itself, its properties, but we can attain it the way it appears to %0a> us: Atilc deliberately diminishes and changes itself in such a way that the lower %0a> ones could attain the outer form (its properties) in which it appears to them, %0a> but not Atilc itself. %0a> %0a> In the words of The Zohar, when Atilc wished to reveal itself to the worlds, %0a> although it is a Partzuf that acts according to the laws of the first restriction, it %0a> "clothed itself in the garments" (an external Partzuf that acts according to the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 93 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> laws of the second restriction) with regard to the lower ones so as to enable them %0a> to perceive and attain it. %0a> %0a> There is an enormous difference between the properties of the sensory %0a> organs that perceive sensations of the first and the second restrictions. Just as %0a> man in our world is born without sensory organs that can perceive spiritual %0a> worlds, which is why he cannot sense them, so is the Partzuf that is corrected %0a> for the conditions of spiritual work at the level of the second restriction unable %0a> to accept (perceive) the Light that descends according to the law of the first %0a> restriction. A similar distinction exists between Partzuf Atik and the other %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> To be connected to the lower ones, Atik elevated Malchut de Rosh de AA %0a> within the Rosh of the lower-standing AA up to the Sefira Hochma. As a result, %0a> Sefirot Bina and ZON de Rosh de AA fell from the Rosh of AA to its Guf. After %0a> all, Malchut ascended from the Peh to the Eynaim and stood in the Rosh at place %0a> of Bina, whereas Bina and ZON exited the Rosh. The Guf (body) begins after %0a> Malchut de Rosh (after the decision on how to act), wherever it may be. %0a> %0a> Here is how one should understand this: the Sefirot of the Rosh are the %0a> thoughts and desires with regards to which the Partzuf, man's inner properties %0a> (man himself) makes the decisions as to how they can be used in order to advance %0a> as much as possible toward the goal of creation. The fact that Sefirot Bina and %0a> ZON exited the Rosh of AA means that Partzuf AA cannot make any decisions %0a> with regard to them for lack of a screen on them. This is why they fell into the %0a> Guf, outside the Rosh. %0a> %0a> Hence, their remaining role is only to receive the Light from the Rosh, just %0a> as it is received by all the Sefirot of the Guf. In other words, they receive the Light %0a> that is accepted by the screen of Sefirot Keter and Hochma that remained in the %0a> Rosh. Man deliberately restricts the use of his desires, and uses only those desires %0a> with which he can work for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when Malchut ascended and stood under the Sefira Hochma, %0a> Hochma became like the male part (bestowing, fulfilling), and Malchut became %0a> like the female (receiving) part of the Rosh. And since Malchut took the place of %0a> Bina (called "thought"), Malchut assumed the name "thought," since now it's %0a> Malchut that makes a Zivug and receives Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> A Partzuf that receives from Hochma is defined as Bina, and not Malchut. %0a> Therefore, although Malchut herself is merely a black point (egoistic creature), as %0a> a result of her ascent, she becomes Bina, i.e., Malchut acquires Bina's properties. %0a> Hence, Malchut is now called Bina or "thought." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 94 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar calls a "thought" either to Hochma or to Bina. The difference is %0a> that a thought is something that is received from Hochma. Hence, Bina is called %0a> a thought only if she is in the Rosh and receives the Light from Hochma. In %0a> the first restriction, Bina always receives from Hochma, and is called "thought." %0a> However, in the second restriction, Malchut ascended above Bina and started %0a> receiving from Hochma. That is why it is Malchut that is now called "thought," %0a> and not Bina. %0a> %0a> All the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA are created by this ascent of Malchut %0a> to Bina. Therefore, it is written: IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, %0a> AND IN HER CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS-Se/irot Keter and Hochma %0a> remained in the Rosh of each Partzuf, and a Zivug was made on these two Sefirot. %0a> This is why the Light received in Guf of the Partzuf consists of only two Lights, %0a> Ne/esh and Ruach. %0a> %0a> Previously, Malchut stood in Peh de Rosh and the Rosh (the part of the Partzuf %0a> in which it calculated how much Light it can receive for the Creator's sake) %0a> ended there. Then, the Partzuf would receive that Light from the Rosh to the %0a> Guf, between the Peh and the Tahur. %0a> %0a> But now Malchut ascended to Eynaim de Rosh and stands under them. This %0a> is known as the ascent of Malchut to NE (Nikvey Eynaim - pupils of the eyes), %0a> which are called NE precisely because Nikvey Eynaim means Malchut of the eyes. %0a> Prior to Malchut's ascent to the Eynaim, it was as though there were no pupils %0a> (NE). It is worth noting that only in Malchut (desire) can we feel what surrounds %0a> us (the Creator, Light). This is why all of our sensory organs are designed as %0a> apertures: Nekev (orifice), Nukva, Malchut in the eyes, Awznaim (ears), Hotem %0a> (nose) and Peh (mouth). %0a> %0a> Only he who can create desires that work according to the principle of the %0a> second restriction through his own strength and effort, and puts Malchut after %0a> er-Hochma (thinks in terms of bestowal), can start perceiving through tl %0a> ted spiritual sensory organ. Wherever there is a screen, it constitutes %0a> %0a> Upon her ascent, Malchut stood under Hochma and made a Zivug on her %0a> own screen, on Sefirot Keter-Hochma (GE). Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut (AHP) are %0a> located below the Rosh, in the Guf of the Partzuf, and passively receive the Light %0a> from the Rosh. This leads to a division of the ten Sefirot of the Guf, KHB-ZA-M, %0a> in the same way the ten Sefirot of the Rosh were divided: Sefirot K-H of the Guf %0a> continue receiving from K-H of the Rosh, and Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Guf, being %0a> unable to receive from the Rosh, start receiving from K-H of the Guf, like the %0a> Sefirot below the Tahur of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 95 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As is well-known, every Partzuf consists of a Rosh, a Guf, and extremities. %0a> The Rosh decides how much Light the Guf can receive for the Creator's sake, in %0a> accordance with the magnitude of the screen that reflects the Light (pleasure). %0a> The decision to accept this Light causes the Light to descend through the screen, %0a> from the Rosh to the Guf, filling it from the Peh down to the Tahur. Each Sefira %0a> of the Rosh fills its corresponding Sefira in the Guf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf in the 1 st Restriction %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> 5 Parts of the Head %0a> Mouth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> 5 Parts of the Body %0a> Tabur %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> 5 Parts of the Extremities %0a> Feet %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf in the 2 nd Restriction %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Mouth %0a> %0a> %0a> 2 Parts of the Head %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> 2 Parts of the Body %0a> %0a> Tabur %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> 2 Parts of the Extremities %0a> Feet %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Parts outside of Partzuf %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 96 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> If there are only two Sefirot K-H in the Rosh, then only the two Sefirot K-H %0a> remain in the Guf. This is because only they can receive from the corresponding %0a> Sefirot in the Rosh. Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh receive the same Light as Sefirot K-H %0a> of the Guf, which means that they are located under the screen (Malchut that %0a> ascends and stands under Hochma de Rosh). Thus, the Guf contains K-H that %0a> receive, accordingly, the Lights Ruach-Nefesh, and AHP of the Rosh that receive %0a> these two Lights of Ruach-Nefesh, too. %0a> %0a> B-ZA-M (AHP) of the Guf cannot receive the Light from the Rosh, as their %0a> corresponding Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh do not participate in a Zivug, since they %0a> lack the strength of the screen sufficient to reflect the egoistic desires of AHP %0a> de Rosh so as to receive for the Creator's sake. In other words, since there are %0a> no AHP in the Rosh, there are also no AHP in the Guf. And since AHP de Guf %0a> receive no Light from AHP de Rosh, they are like the extremities— the end of a %0a> Partzuf, below its Tabur. Hence, at the end of a Partzuf, below Tahur, there are GE %0a> of Raglaim (feet) and AHP de Guf, which fell there. And AHP of Raglaim are not %0a> parts of a Partzuf whatsoever, as they are located at a lower degree. %0a> %0a> The Light that cannot be received by the Partzuf remains outside, surrounding %0a> it, and waits until the Partzuf acquires the strength to receive it. It is called %0a> "Surrounding Light," and it corresponds to the desires that do not take part in %0a> a Zivug, those desires that are still uncorrected and lack a screen. %0a> %0a> If, previously, before the second restriction, Malchut (the last Sefira of the %0a> Guf) was in Tahur, now, when only two Sefirot K-H remain in the Guf, Malchut de %0a> Guf, too, ascends to Bina de Guf, called Chazeh. Therefore, when Malchut ascends %0a> to Bina de Rosh, the entire Partzuf "diminishes" in size: the Rosh reaches only up %0a> to the Eynaim, the Guf only to the Chazeh, and the Raglaim only to Tabur. And %0a> that is why this state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Katnut." %0a> %0a> However, if the Partzuf receives new strength from Above, acquires a Masach %0a> (screen), it will be able to resolve to accept the Light for the Creator's sake in its %0a> AHP, then AHP de Rosh will rise again from the Guf to the Rosh, and complete the %0a> Rosh to ten Sefirot, while the Sefirot of AHP de Guf will ascend from the Raglaim back %0a> to their place in order to receive additional Light. And then Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim %0a> will all contain ten Sefirot. This state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Gadlut." %0a> %0a> In the language of The Zohar, the restriction of a Partzuf, its transition from %0a> the Gadlut state to the Katnut state is described as a division of each part of the %0a> Partzuf (Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim) into GE (MI) and AHP (ELEH). All ten Sefirot %0a> are called by the Creator's name Elokim, which consists of the letters ELEH- %0a> IM, that are further divided into MI - GE - K-H and ELEH - B-ZA-M. When %0a> in Katnut, only Sefirot ELEH maintain their degree, whereas Sefirot IM fall to a %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 97 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lower degree.

As soon as the Partzuf acquires new %0a> strength (Masach) to receive the Light selflessly in Sefirot/ Kelim B-ZA-M (ELEH), %0a> it will immediately attach them to itself and receive in them the Lights Neshama- %0a> Haya-Yechida.

He confirmed in the sacred and concealed candle (in Malchut that %0a> merged with Bina), a concealed image, the Holy of Holies, a secret structure %0a> that emerges from the thought, QAR that is called MI, which is the beginning %0a> of this structure. It stands and it does not stand; it is great and concealed in %0a> the name Elokim (ELEH and IM). It is called MI from the word Elokim, %0a> that is, it lacks the letters ELEH of the name Elokim. He desired to be %0a> revealed and called by the complete name Elokim, so He clothed Himself %0a> in a splendid shining garment, the Light of Hassadim. He created ELEH. %0a> The letters ELEH of the name Elokim ascended and combined with the %0a> letters MI and formed the complete name Elokim. And until He created %0a> ELEH, He did not rise (did not ascend) to the name Elokim. Hence, those %0a> who sinned by worshipping the Golden Calf alluded to this secret by saying, %0a> "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!" (Shemot, 32:4). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 98 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!"— that is, these egoistic desires (ELEH) are %0a> your deity, which you must worship until you correct yourself. The use of ELEH %0a> is the reason for all transgressions and ruin: the breaking of the vessels (Kelim), %0a> the sin of Adam and the shattering of his soul into 600,000 pieces, worshipping %0a> the Golden Calf and the breaking of the Tablets by Moshe, the ruin of the First %0a> and Second Temples, and so forth. %0a> %0a> As a result of the lower ones raising MAN, meaning their request to %0a> receive the strength necessary to make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma for %0a> the Creator's sake, there descends from Above the Light called MAD (Mayin %0a> Dechurin)-the force that enables the Kli to create a Masach capable of reflecting %0a> Light, thereby resisting its egoistic nature. This force comes in the form of %0a> Light, the sensation of the Creator's greatness, and is referred to as the Light of %0a> AB-SAG, as it descends from the Partzufim Hochma (AB) and Bina (SAG) of the %0a> world of AK (Adam Kadmon). %0a> %0a> If one ascends from the degree called "our world" to the worlds BYA, then %0a> wherever he may be in those worlds, his request for spiritual correction will rise %0a> through all the worlds and degrees up to Partzuf SAG. SAG turns to AB, receives %0a> the Light of Hochma from it, and passes it down to all the Partzufim along which %0a> MAN had ascended. %0a> %0a> Since the entire world of AK exists in the first restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph) %0a> and above the second restriction (Tzimtzum Bet), the Light that comes from %0a> it provides the Kli that receives this Light with the strength to pass from the %0a> small state to the big one. In other words, the Light of AB-SAG enables the Kli %0a> to create a Masach, reflect the Light of Hochma, and receive it for the Creator's %0a> sake. The Gadlut state is called "the holy of holies," for being filled with the %0a> Light of GAR (the holy of holies) is utterly perfect. %0a> %0a> The Light of AB-SAG first descends to the Rosh of Partzuf AA and lowers %0a> the point (Malchut) from the thought (Bina) back to its place in the Peh, where %0a> it was prior to Tzimtzum Bet. In consequence, the three Sefirot B-ZA-M rejoin the %0a> two Sefirot KH and become five Sefirot in the Rosh, AHP (ELEH) ascend and join %0a> with GE (MI), and the Creator's name Elokim is completed. %0a> %0a> However, this does not mean that the Partzuf can be filled with the five %0a> Lights NRNHY; it merely acquires a Masach, the strength to receive the Light %0a> in all its ten Sefirot. Since only Ohr Hochma shines in AA, this Light cannot %0a> fill the elevated Kelim of ELEH, as they can only receive Ohr Hochma if it is %0a> clothed by Ohr Hassadim. Only the GAR of the Partzuf (K-H-B) can have pure %0a> Ohr Hochma; the ZAT of the Partzuf (Sefirot ZA-M) can only receive diminished %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 99 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma— half-mixed with Ohr Hassadim. This is called the reception of Ohr %0a> Hochma in the middle line (consisting of half Hochma and half Hassadim). %0a> %0a> Therefore, says The Zohar, THIS STRUCTURE STANDS AND IT DOES %0a> NOT STAND— even though all the Sefirot are already present in the Rosh, %0a> they still need to be filled with Light, meaning that Sefirot ELEH are not yet %0a> revealed in the name Elokim. Only the letters MI have so far been revealed %0a> (filled with the Light). %0a> %0a> Hence, first, the Partzuf makes a Zivug on its Katnut state and receives Ohr %0a> Hassadim. Then, it clothes Ohr Hochma into PRECIOUS GARMENT (Ohr %0a> Hassadim). Only afterwards can the mixed Light of Hassadim and Hochma fill %0a> Sefirot ZAT (ELEH), and all five Sefirot will shine in perfection. %0a> %0a> However, before MI gives Ohr Hassadim to ELEH so as to enable ELEH %0a> to receive Ohr Hochma in it, ELEH cannot receive Ohr Hochma, and only the %0a> Light of MI shines in the entire name Elokim. Further, The Zohar tells us that %0a> neglect of Ohr Hassadim (the intention for the Creator's sake) is precisely what %0a> constitutes the entire transgression. And since they transgressed, i.e., neglected %0a> Ohr Hassadim, that is, since they did not wish to receive with the intention "for %0a> the Creator's sake," but desired only Ohr Hochma, they caused the separation %0a> of MI from ELEH. Hence, it is written, ELEH - THIS (the desires of reception %0a> and not MI, the desires of bestowal) IS YOUR LORD, ISRAEL-and the Light %0a> instantly passed to the impure forces. %0a> %0a> The Torah does not tell us about the history of an ancient nation, but %0a> about the structure of the spiritual degrees that we must attain. To know the %0a> properties of these degrees (whose attainment is designated by the acquisition %0a> of their properties), Kabbalah explains to us how they were originally created by %0a> a gradual descent (spiritual coarsening) from the Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> And in order to give us an opportunity to correct our egoism, the Creator %0a> mixed it with altruism at the very creation of the spiritual degrees. This kind %0a> of mixing of opposite properties is possible only through an "explosion," since %0a> opposite properties cannot be combined otherwise. There were several such %0a> mixtures that occurred as a result of explosions (breaking of properties). %0a> %0a> One of them is mentioned in the Torah (Shemot, 32:4), when, by worshiping %0a> the Golden Calf, the sons of Israel (the altruistic desires of "bestowal") suddenly %0a> wished to receive the Light for themselves. Consequently, the Sefirot (Kelim) of %0a> GE and AHP mixed together, and the properties (desires) of GE penetrated %0a> AHP. Through these altruistic properties that are secretly concealed within a %0a> small, egoistic human being, it is possible to awaken him, to evoke in him an %0a> aspiration to ascend spiritually and to disregard this world. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 100 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ved %0a> iin %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ;refore, everything that is written in the Torah should not be percer %0a> lot as history, but as an instruction manual. All the actions described %0a> the Torah are positive: all the devastations, including the ruin of the First and %0a> the Second Temples, wars, adultery and murder. We only need to realize what %0a> exactly the Torah is telling us. And one can understand it correctly only if he %0a> stops perceiving it as a collection of injunctions referring to the mechanical %0a> performance of commandments. %0a> %0a> 15. Just as MI join ELEH into one name Elokim, when Hochma clothes itself %0a> in Hassadim, so is the name combined by this precious shining garment. %0a> The world exists thanks to this secret, as is written, "The world was created %0a> by mercy." (Tehilim, 89:3). Then Eliyahu flew away, and I did not see him %0a> anymore. Yet, it is from him that I discovered that I stood upon the secret and %0a> its concealment. Rabbi Elazar approached with the others, and they bowed %0a> down before him. They wept and said, "If we have come into this world %0a> only to hear this— it is enough for us!" %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon continues his explanation: There is only one law of reception %0a> of Ohr Hochma: Ohr Hochma can only be received if Ohr Hassadim clothes it %0a> beforehand. Just as this occurs in Partzuf Bina, called "the Upper World," so %0a> does it occur in Partzuf Malchut (MA, ~Nukva of ZA), called "the lower world." %0a> Malchut is typically referred to as BON, but when she joins ZA and receives the %0a> Light from him, she is called by his name— MA. %0a> %0a> The Upper World, Bina of the world of Atzilut, desires only Hassadim, %0a> but the lower world, Malchut of the world of Atzilut, wants Hochma. However, %0a> Eliyahu the prophet spoke only of the order of Light and the structure of the %0a> name Elokim in AVI (Bina de Atzilut), whereas Rabbi Shimon continues his %0a> explanation in the next article and describes the structure and reception of %0a> Light in the name Elokim in Malchut de Atzilut herself. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes %0a> to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 16. Heaven, Earth, and all that inhabit them were created by MA, which is %0a> Malchut, as it is said: "When I behold your Heavens, the work of your hands" %0a> (Tehilim, 8:4). And before this, it is said, "MA - WHAT (How) majestic Your %0a> name is throughout the earth, which You established above the Heavens" %0a> (Tehilim, 8:2). After all, the Heavens were created by the name (property) %0a> MA (Malchut). It is written "in the Heavens," which refers to Bina, called %0a> MI, the Heavens that are above ZA. The explanation for this lies in the name %0a> Elokim. MA (Malchut) ascends and enters with her properties into Bina, %0a> i.e., connects into Bina, and receives her properties. Bina is called Elokim. %0a> After He CREATED LIGHT FOR LIGHT, meaning Ohr (Light) Hassadim %0a> (called "precious adornments or garments") so as to clothe Ohr Hochma, %0a> Ohr Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma, which signifies the creation of Light for %0a> Light; by the force of the Supernal Name Elokim (Bina), Malchut ascends, %0a> and, upon joining Bina, receives all of her properties, and includes herself in %0a> Bina. Therefore, BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the %0a> Creator created) refers to the Supernal Elokim, to Bina and not to Malchut. %0a> For MA (Malchut) is not created by the name MI ELEH. %0a> %0a> The lower world (Malchut, MA) receives the Light (marked from Above %0a> by the name Elokim) from Bina. This Light brings Malchut strength, and the %0a> properties suitable for the creation of Heaven, earth, and posterity manifest %0a> within her. After all, there cannot be any posterity or birth of new generations %0a> without the Light of Haya. %0a> %0a> And this is what The Zohar tells us: so does the lower world (Malchut, MA) %0a> exist by the name Elokim, by the name from the Upper World, which is why %0a> %0a> 101 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 102 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> there's strength in Malchut (Ohr Hochma) to create generations. And if Malchut %0a> has Ohr Hochma, then the world can be created by her. %0a> %0a> (Haya is one type of Ohr Hochma. There is one Light that the Creator %0a> emanates, or rather, the sensation of the Creator we refer to as Light. This %0a> sensation depends on the desires-Kelim in which we feel Him. And since there %0a> are only two types of desires-Kelim, those of "bestowal" and those of "reception," %0a> there exist only two types of Light, Hassadim and Hochma. However, each of %0a> them includes several subtypes, and Ohr Haya constitutes a particular form of %0a> Ohr Hochma. This is because Hochma is the Light or pleasure that is felt by the %0a> will "to receive," whereas Hassadim is the pleasure that is felt by the will "to %0a> bestow." If only the Kelim of bestowal (GE) are present in the Partzuf, it is filled %0a> with Ohr Hassadim; and if it has the strength to receive for the Creator's sake, it %0a> is filled with Ohr Hochma.) (Do not confuse this with MA, which is used here, %0a> where MA = Malchut with ZA = MA in Gematria). %0a> %0a> The Zohar explains that the Light descends from the name Elokim thanks %0a> to the merging of MI and ELEH. ZA is called "Heaven." YESHSUT is above %0a> Heaven (ZA). There is no MI in Heaven (ZA), only MA. However, after Ohr %0a> Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma (the Light ELEH = AHP clothes the Light of MA %0a> = GE), all the letters combine and ascend by the name Elokim above Heaven = %0a> ZA = MA to YESHSUT = Bina = MI. %0a> %0a> MI (Bina) is above the second restriction, above its ban, as her properties %0a> are higher, better than those to which the restriction extends: the property %0a> of Bina is "not to receive anything," which is why the ban of the second %0a> restriction— to not receive— simply does not apply to her, for in her essence, %0a> she has no desire to receive. %0a> %0a> There remains only the ban of T^imt^um Alef>h, the restriction imposed on %0a> the reception of Light in Malchut herself (Malchut de Malchut), the central point %0a> of all creation, the only creating being. Malchut herself is egoistic, but if she has %0a> a Masach and only receives the Light by means of a Zivug de Hakaa (resistance %0a> to one's own desire, only for the Creator's sake) on the desires of bestowal, such %0a> reception does not occur in Malchut, but rather in the first nine Sefirot. Hence, %0a> Malchut can receive the Light in her first nine Sefirot. %0a> %0a> In other words, if Malchut has the will (strength) to receive (enjoy) the Light %0a> (pleasure) not for herself, but only because the Creator so desires, then she %0a> receives only this amount of Light (pleasure). In order to receive the Light under %0a> such a condition, Malchut (man's inclination to pleasure and enjoyment) must %0a> first reject all incoming pleasure, which Malchut perceives to be right there before %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 103 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> her. This is referred to as the Light's (the pleasure's) impact against the screen %0a> and its reflection off the screen (the reflection of pleasure by force of will so as %0a> to not receive, in spite of the natural, primordial desire to receive pleasure). %0a> %0a> The reflected pleasure is called Ohr Hassadim. Essentially, this is not a Light, %0a> but rather Malchut's intention to receive only for the Creator's sake. However, %0a> this intention is that necessary and sufficient condition for the subsequent %0a> reception of Ohr Hochma from the Creator. For after Malchut repelled all the %0a> Light (expressed her intention to not receive for her own sake), she thereby %0a> met the condition of Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) to only receive the Light %0a> of Hochma in the intention for the Creator's sake, which is called Ohr Hozer %0a> (Returning Light) or Ohr Hassadim. And now she can receive Ohr Hochma, the %0a> pleasure that the Creator wants to bestow upon her. %0a> %0a> However, by receiving this Light, Malchut is no more a mere recipient- %0a> creature. Now, like the Creator, she bestows pleasure upon Him! In this %0a> manner, the creature attains the degree of the Creator, becomes equal to Him %0a> in properties, for it wants to bestow everything. This is called "being filled with %0a> Ohr Hassadim." Moreover, Malchut receives and enjoys, for if she does not feel %0a> pleasure, she will not please the Creator. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Malchut receives, meaning she is filled with Ohr Hochma, full of %0a> wisdom and pleasure, from both bestowal and reception for the Creator's sake. %0a> And herein lies the perfection of the Creator's Creation: she becomes perfect %0a> and similar to the Creator. And this is the perfection of the Creator's works: His %0a> creation can ascend to His level independently! %0a> %0a> One can imagine one's path from the lows of our world up to the ultimate %0a> spiritual peak— the Creator— as a passage through a suite of rooms. In all, %0a> between our state and the Creator there are 125 connected, walkthrough %0a> rooms. Each room has its own properties, and only those who possess the same %0a> properties can be there. If, regardless of reason, man changes his properties, %0a> he is automatically moved as though by an invisible current to a room that %0a> corresponds to his new properties. %0a> %0a> This is how one can move between these rooms: an infinitesimal inner %0a> change of properties evokes influence of a spiritual force-field upon man, %0a> immediately moves to his new place of equilibrium, where his inne %0a> completely coincide with the external properties of the spiri %0a> ce, there are no guards at the rooms' entrances/ exits; as soon as %0a> es himself so as to match the properties of the next, higher room, he is %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 104 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> pleasure %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> s the %0a> Lse %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> What properties must one change in order to move from one rc %0a> another within this spiritual field? He only needs to alter the type of pie %0a> to which he aspires. We cannot help receiving pleasure, for such is the entire %0a> material of creation, it is all that was created. However, we can change the object %0a> of our aspirations, what it is that we wish to enjoy: either coarse reception, %0a> reception of mere necessities, or the Creator being pleased with us that we %0a> bestow to Him, that we receive because such is His wish. %0a> %0a> Our "I," the entity that feels pleasure is present in all of our desires, which %0a> ange ceaselessly in terms of both magnitude and the desired object. %0a> vex disappears. The only thing of which one should rid himself is %0a> sensation that he does something to please this "I." One should aspire to sense %0a> the desires of the Creator, how He is pleased with him (just as a mother %0a> pleased with her son's achievements). %0a> %0a> After Malchut decides to receive only for the Creator's sake, i.e., according %0a> to the force of her Masach (the force of resistance to her egoistic will to receive %0a> pleasure), she receives Ohr Hochma only in accordance with the magnitude of %0a> the Returning Light. Or, conversely, one may say that the magnitude of the %0a> Returning Light determines man's willpower and his desire to act for the %0a> Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> However, the first nine of Malchut's ten Sefirot are not egoistic, as they are %0a> the Creator's properties with which He wishes to correct Malchut. Only the last %0a> Sefira of Malchut, Malchut herself, the single creation, called Malchut de Malchut, %0a> is egoistic and remains under the ban of the first restriction: Ohr Hochma does %0a> not enter where the will to receive pleasure is present. Therefore, the first nine %0a> Sefirot can receive the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> However, after the second restriction, in order to correct Malchut and impart %0a> the properties of mercy (Hassadim) onto her so she would be able to desire to %0a> "bestow," acquire the properties of Bina, and convert her initial, primordial %0a> egoism into altruism, Malchut ascended to Partzuf Aha, became Malchut in %0a> Partzuf Aha in Bina 's place, while Bina found herself below Malchut. Bina herself %0a> can receive Ohr Hochma without any restrictions, even when below Malchut. %0a> However, Bina adopted the limitations of Tzimtzum Bet for the sole purpose of %0a> correcting Malchut. %0a> %0a> Therefore, due to the MAN raised by the lower ones, by man's requests for %0a> spiritual correction, the Light AB-SAG descends and lowers Malchut from the %0a> level of Bina back to her own place: Malchut descends from Bina, and the Light %0a> of attainment and wisdom is revealed. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 105 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As a result of Malchut's descent, Bina purifies herself from all restrictions and %0a> limitations and returns to receiving Ohr Hochma. And after the Ohr Hassadim %0a> clothes the Ohr Hochma, MI shines in ELEH and the name Elokim is revealed, %0a> meaning that Ohr Hochma shines. %0a> %0a> The structure of the name Elokim cannot be found in MA, for the lower %0a> boundary of Heaven (Malchut herself) is limited by Tzimtzum Aleph— the ban %0a> imposed on the reception of Ohr Hochma, and by Tzimtzum Bet's 6,000-year long %0a> prohibition on the usage of the desires of reception. Hence, The Zohar tells us %0a> that the name Elokim was created with MI, and not with MA, by the property %0a> received by Malchut upon her ascent to Bina. %0a> %0a> 17. But as the letters ELEH descend from Above, from Bina down to Malchut, %0a> for the mother temporarily lends her clothes to her daughter and adorns her %0a> with her own adornments, the name Elokim descends from Bina (mother) %0a> to Malchut (daughter). When does she adorn her with her own adornments? %0a> When she sees the male essence before her. It is then written of her, "Three %0a> times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord Creator" (Shemot, %0a> 34:23). For Malchut is then called by the male name "Master." As it is written: %0a> "Behold the Ark of the Union, the Master of all the earth" (Yehoshua, 3:11). %0a> The Torah is the Union and the Ark is Malchut, called by the male name %0a> "Master." For she received the Kelim (properties, desires) called "clothes," %0a> and the Light called "adornments" from her mother, Bina. The letter Hey %0a> (A from MA) then leaves MA (Mem + Hey) and the letter Yod (I) enters in %0a> its stead, and just like Bina, Malchut assumes the name MI. And then she %0a> adorns herself with male clothes, with the clothes of Bina, to accept all the %0a> husbands of Israel. %0a> %0a> As it is written (item 13), Tzimtzum Bet is in force from the Rosh of AA %0a> downwards, for Malchut of AA ascended to Bina and created all the lower %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut in the property of Tzimtzum Bet. Thus, each %0a> Partzuf of AA, AVI and ZON has only two Sefirot K-H, and three Sefirot B-ZA-M %0a> separated themselves (their properties) from that degree, and moved to a lower %0a> one (their properties became equal to it). This is how B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf %0a> AA) fell to Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf AVI, B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf AVI) fell to %0a> Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf ZON, and B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf ZON) fell below %0a> Parsa to the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> Sefirot K-H (GE) that remained in their degree in their Partzuf are called %0a> MI, and Sefirot B-ZA-M that separated (in their properties) and descended (by %0a> equivalence in properties) to a lower Partzuf are called ELEH. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 106 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE CREATOR %0a> %0a> THE WORLD OFATZILUT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> AA (the 1st Restriction is in force above AA) %0a> %0a> %0a> D %0a> %0a> D %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of AA fell to GE of AVI %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> B %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of AVI fell toGEof ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> B %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of ZON fell to GE of BYA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of BYA fell to the point of our world - in the sensation %0a> of a person who has attained the level of "our world" %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> BUT AS THE LETTERS ELEH DESCEND FROM ABOVE-when Malchut %0a> is expelled from Bina, the letters ELEH get detached from AVI and fall to ZON %0a> (a lower degree), and clothe themselves in ZON: ELEH of Aba (YESHS - Israel %0a> Saba) clothe ZA, and ELEH of Ima {Tvuna) clothe Malchut. Bina of the world of %0a> Atzilut is a complex Partzuf: her GE constitute AVI (two Partzufim), and her AHP %0a> have the name of a separate Partzuf YESHS UT, for they fulfill separate functions %0a> with regard to ZON: Bina-. GE = MI = GE of Aba + Ml = GE of Ima. ELEH = AHP %0a> of Aba = YESHS (Israel Saba) + T (Tvuna) = ELEH = AHP of Ima. %0a> %0a> When Ohr Haya descends from Above (as a result of which Malchut descends %0a> from Bina's level back to her own place), three Sefirot B-ZA-M thereby return to %0a> their degree, and correspondingly, Sefirot KHB (called the "holy of holies") enter %0a> the now complete Partzuf consisting of five Sefirot. (Here, the Light is called by %0a> the name of the Sefirot it fills.) Previously, there was only Ohr Ruach-Ne/esh in %0a> K-H, and now Ohr Neshama-Haya-Yechida was added to KHB, while Ruach-Nefesh %0a> descended to ZA-M. %0a> %0a> However, when AHP of Rosh de AA (B-ZA-M of Rosh de AA) that fell to its %0a> Guf ascend (return from Guf to Rosh de AA), the Kelim of GE de AVI ascend %0a> along with them to Rosh de AA. (These are the Kelim of GE de AVI that were %0a> clothed in AHP de AA in their small state, when AHP de AA had fallen to GE %0a> de AVI.) Once there, the Kelim of GE de AVI receive the Light called "holy of %0a> holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 107 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that when the Upper One descends to the lower one, %0a> it becomes like the lower one. And when the lower one ascends to the Upper %0a> One it becomes like the Upper One. This is because no space or motion exist in %0a> the spiritual, and only a change of properties instantly and automatically moves %0a> a Partzuf or its part in spiritual space, closer (higher) to the Creator or farther %0a> away (lower) from Him. Therefore, spiritual ascent itself implies a change of %0a> properties of the lower one to those of the Upper One, and a descent of the %0a> Upper One signifies that its properties became equal to the properties of the %0a> degree to which it descended. %0a> %0a> Hence, in Katnut, when Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP de Rosh of Partzuf AA separate %0a> from its head and fall (move according to their now inferior properties) to its %0a> Guf, from Peh to Chazeh, where Partzuf AVI clothes Partzuf AA, they (B-ZA-M = %0a> ZON = AHP de Rosh of AA) become like AVI in their properties, without Ohr %0a> Hochma, and only with the Light of Bina, Hassadim. %0a> %0a> That is why, in Gadlut, when B-ZA-M = AHP de AA return to the Rosh (the %0a> degree that is higher than Guf), they take with them GE of AVI, as they all became %0a> one degree while in Katnut. Therefore, in Gadlut, GE of AVI ascend from AHP %0a> de Rosh of AA to Rosh de AA and become equal to it (in their properties), where %0a> they receive the Light called "holy of holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a> %0a> ZON ascend to AVI in the same way: after AVI receive the Light in Rosh %0a> de AA, they acquire strength (screen), and lower Malchut from Bina back to %0a> her place in Malchut, thereby enabling their Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP to return to %0a> their degree, AVI, as in AA. However, when the Kelim-Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP %0a> de Bina that were inside K-H = GE de ZON ascend to AVI, they also take with %0a> them Sefirot of ZON, which they've clothed-K-H = GE de ZON. Thus, K-H = %0a> GE de ZON ascend to AVI and there receive the Light called "holy of holies," %0a> the Light of Hay a. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is written that Ima-MOTHER DESCENDS TO HER %0a> DAUGHTER TO DRESS AND ADORN HER: the letters ELEH or Ima %0a> (Bina) in her small state descend to Malchut. This means that THE MOTHER %0a> DESCENDS TO HER DAUGHTER, for the three Sefirot of Ima assumed the %0a> property of Malchut, thereby separating from Bina and becoming a part of %0a> Malchut. This is akin to Bina giving part of her Kelim to Malchut. Yet, this gift is %0a> temporary, as though Bina LENDS, GIVES (these Kelim) FOR TEMPORARY %0a> USE, and thus, Malchut uses them temporarily. %0a> %0a> And then, Ima-Bina (mother) ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a> ADORNMENTS. This is so because in Gadlut, when the three Sefirot ELEH %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 108 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> return to Bina, Malchut ascends to the degree of Bina together with them, %0a> and there receives the Light of "holy of holies." And since an ascent to Bina %0a> implies becoming like Bina (in properties), she now has the right to receive the %0a> same Light as Bina. %0a> %0a> It turns out that, as a result of the mother lowering her Kelim (properties) %0a> ELEH to her daughter by intentionally assuming the properties (desires) of %0a> Malchut instead of her own properties (desires), thereby entering the small state %0a> and willingly diminishing herself, upon receiving the properties of Malchut %0a> instead of properties of Bina, mother Bina adorned her daughter Malchut with %0a> her adornments, meaning the Light that subsequently comes in the state of %0a> Gadlut: the Light of Bina entered Malchut. This is described as "Malchut received %0a> her adornments." %0a> %0a> There are two kinds of adornments that the daughter Malchut receives %0a> from her mother Bina: the first is Ohr Hochma (Ohr Haya, the Light of GAR), %0a> the Light of perfection, for it imparts the property of perfection to the Kli %0a> that it is filling, the Light that Malchut receives from Ima (Supernal Mother), %0a> who stands between Peh and Chazeh of Partzuf AA, above its Parsa. The second %0a> adornment is Ohr Neshama, which still designates imperfection, as it is received %0a> from the lower mother, Partzuf of Tvuna that stands between Chazeh and Tabur %0a> de AA, below its Parsa. %0a> %0a> Naturally, to receive either Light, Malchut must ascend to the corresponding %0a> degree. In other words, she must change her properties so as to be able to receive, %0a> to merit that Light. %0a> %0a> When Malchut ascends to Tvuna and receives her adornments from Tvuna, %0a> these adornments are still imperfect, for Malchut remains with a "question" %0a> (without the Light of Hochma), as Tvuna was before the raising of MAN. This %0a> means that to attain perfection, Malchut still needs to receive MAN from the %0a> lower ones, called the "husbands of Israel." In this state, the lower ones, called %0a> the righteous or "the husbands of Israel," receive the Light from ZA, which %0a> ascended to YESHS = hrael-Saha. %0a> %0a> However, when Malchut ascends another degree, to the place of the Supernal %0a> Mother, Bina, above Chazeh de AA, and there receives her adornments from Ima %0a> and not from Tvuna, then these adornments are perfect, for they contain Ohr %0a> Haya; there is no more "question" in her, as she is considered a male, bestowing %0a> Kli, and the husbands of Israel receive from her. %0a> %0a> And all the husbands of Israel appear before her and receive the Light from %0a> her. And Malchut is CALLED MASTER (Hebrew - Adon). The regular Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 109 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> is called by the Creator's female name Adonay (mistress) or ADM, whereas in %0a> this state she is called by the male name Adon (master). %0a> %0a> And this is because Malchut no longer has a question, for MAN is no longer %0a> raised within her, as she has reached perfection (Light of Haya) and is therefore %0a> called "husband" or master (Adon). Hence, the prophet said: BEHOLD THE %0a> ARK OF THE COVENANT, THE MASTER (Adon) OF ALL THE EARTH %0a> (Yehoshua, 3:11). Malchut is called the "Ark," for ZA, who bestows upon her, %0a> is called the "Covenant." The Zohar calls Malchut the "Master of all the earth" %0a> or "husband." %0a> %0a> As a result of the letter Hey in the word MA (Mem-Hey), signifying the female %0a> essence, leaving Malchut, for the letter Hey signifies the presence of a question in %0a> Malchut, i.e., the absence of Ohr Hochma, whereas Ohr Hochma brings absolute %0a> knowledge, all questions disappear, and with them the letter Hey. The letter Yod %0a> ascends to the place of Hey, and Malchut assumes the name MI as Ima, which %0a> signifies Malchut's reception of the name Elokim, as the name Ima. %0a> %0a> 18. Israel receives the last letters (ELEH) from Above, from Bina down to %0a> that place, i.e., to Malchut, who is now called MI, just like the name Bina. I %0a> pronounce the letters ELEH and my whole soul weeps so as to receive these %0a> letters ELEH from Bina into the house of Elokim, which is Malchut. So that %0a> Malchut would be called Elokim, just as Bina is called Elokim. How can I %0a> receive them? "With joyous songs of praise sung in the voice of the Torah, and %0a> festive throngs" (Tehilim, 42:4). Rabbi Elazar said, "My silence has erected the %0a> Temple Above, which is Bina, and the Temple below, which is Malchut. Of %0a> course, as people say, 'A word is worth a gold coin (Hebrew - Sela), but silence %0a> is worth two.' So the words 'a word is worth a gold coin' mean that I spoke %0a> and came to regret it. Silence, my silence, is worth twice as much, for the two %0a> worlds, Bina and Malchut, were created by this silence. For had I not kept %0a> silent (see item 11), I would not have attained the unity of both worlds." %0a> %0a> After Hey has left MA and Yod ascended in her place, thereby forming MI, %0a> Israel elevates the LAST LETTERS ELEH to Malchut by raising MAN. As we've %0a> already explained, in Katnut, ELEH of the Upper One fell to GE of the lower %0a> one. Hence, they refer to the lower one in Gadlut as well. For when B-ZA-M = %0a> ELEH of the Upper One return to its Rosh, they thereby elevate GE of the lower %0a> one, too. The lower one thus acquires the ELEH of the Upper One and the %0a> Light with which they filled themselves in their present Gadlut. %0a> %0a> To equalize with the lower one and enter the state of Katnut, the Upper %0a> One deliberately makes Tzimtzum Bet on its AHP. And upon connecting to the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 110 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lower one, the Upper One returns to the state of Gadlut, and passes the Light to %0a> that part of the lower one which they've both occupied in the state of Katnut. %0a> %0a> This scenario is similar to one when a good, strong person joins a company %0a> of wicked men, and connects with them by pretending to be like them. And %0a> when such contact is established between them, he begins to correct them, %0a> little by little, precisely through this connection that has formed between %0a> them beforehand. %0a> %0a> Each Partzuf in the small state is divided into two parts: GE and AHP. %0a> However, since there is a "column" of Partzufim between our world and the %0a> Creator, there is a connection between them via the common parts of the upper %0a> and the lower ones. Precisely because there is a part of an Upper One in each %0a> lower one, the lower one can receive strength from Above, through this common %0a> property, and ascend independently up to the Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> Each Upper One that falls to the lower one completes its Kelim to ten Sefirot: %0a> AHP fall to GE of the lower one, and together they make up ten Sefirot, since %0a> they stand at the same level. In turn, AHP of the lower one falls into GE of the %0a> next lower one, and so on. %0a> %0a> Afterwards, in Gadlut, when GE of the Upper One receive the strength to %0a> attach their AHP to themselves and elevate them, GE of the lower one ascend %0a> together with AHP, as they were joined below. Therefore, upon ascending, GE of %0a> the lower one continue to be joined with AHP of the Upper One, and together %0a> they form a Partzuf of ten Sefirot. %0a> %0a> I PRONOUNCE THE LETTERS ELEH: Israel (one who wishes to receive %0a> the properties of the Creator) raises MAN (prayer for it) to receive in Malchut %0a> the Light of Gadlut (for self-correction) with the help of the letters ELEH, Ima- %0a> Bina. This is achieved by praying near the Gates of Tears, after which no one %0a> ever returns empty-handed, that is, after raising MAN, ELEH descend from AVI %0a> to Malchut, the house of Elokim. This is because after receiving ELEH, Malchut %0a> herself receives the name Elokim, just like Ima. %0a> %0a> A WORD IS WORTH A GOLD COIN, BUT SILENCE IS WORTH %0a> TWO: the words (spiritual action) of Rabbi Elazar (the spiritual Partzuf of that %0a> name) elevated Malchut to Tvuna, below Chazeh de AA, where there is still no %0a> Light of Hochma, which designates the presence of a question in Malchut, a %0a> request for Ohr Hochma. And this is called "gold" (Hebrew - Sela, a gold coin), %0a> for that is the name of Malchut. %0a> %0a> However, Rabbi Elazar's silence enabled Rabbi Shimon to reveal Ohr %0a> Haya by raising Malchut to the Supernal Mother, whereupon both worlds were %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 111 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> simultaneously created, for the lower world, Malchut, was created together with %0a> the Upper World, Bina, of which The Zohar speaks: SILENCE IS WORTH %0a> TWICE (two worlds) AS MUCH. %0a> %0a> 19. Rabbi Shimon said, "From here on the perfection of the written is said to %0a> bring forth their host by number." For these are two degrees, and each must %0a> be recorded, that is, noted: one is called MA and the other MI. MI is the %0a> Upper One, and MA is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, %0a> and brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hey alludes to the %0a> one that is known and unequaled, namely MI. This is similar to the phrase, %0a> "HaMotzi Lechem"— He who brings forth bread from the earth (an appeal to %0a> the Creator), where the letter Hey refers to the knowledge of the known, lower %0a> degree, namely MA. And together they are one degree, Malchut. However, the %0a> Upper One is MI de Malchut and the lower one is MA de Malchut, the one %0a> that brings forth their host by number, for the number 600,000 refers to the %0a> number of stars that stand together, and they bring forth innumerable hosts. %0a> %0a> The Zohar alludes to the words of the prophet (Yeshayahu, 40:26): "Raise %0a> your eyes to the height of Heavens and see: WHO HAS CREATED THESE %0a> (them) - MI BARAH ELEH? He that brings out their host by number, He calls %0a> them all by name; no one shall be hidden from the greatness of His might and %0a> the force of His power." %0a> %0a> The word "recording" means "marked by the letter Hey," for two degrees %0a> must be recorded in Malchut: MI and MA. With the help of the Light that is %0a> received at the time of ascent above Chazeh de AA to the Upper World, Malchut %0a> becomes like the upper world and assumes the name MI, for the letter Hey exits %0a> MA (Mem-Hey), and the letter Yod ascends to its place. Thus, Malchut is called %0a> MI, like the Upper World, and is adorned with the male property. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, MA, the previous degree of Malchut, does not disappear. The %0a> reason for this is that the degree of MI is essential in order to pass the Light, the %0a> perfection of the "holy of holies" to the generations, the posterity of Malchut, %0a> NRN of the righteous, the lower ones. However, the birth and procreation of %0a> these generations (sons) depend on the name MA. Hence, if either (MA or MI) %0a> is missing in Malchut, she will not be able to beget future generations, to create %0a> new souls (lower Partzufim filled with Light). %0a> %0a> Therefore, Malchut BRINGS OUT THEIR HOST BY NUMBER-this %0a> is the degree of MI, which Malchut inherits from the Supernal Mother, for %0a> the letter Hey before the words "brings out" (Motzi = HaMotzi) alludes to the %0a> fact that Malchut contains the perfect Light, called "adornments," which she %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 112 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> receives from AVI. This is the maximal Light that may fill Malchut during the %0a> 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> The same letter, Hey, designates the presence of the Light of YESHSUT, the %0a> degree of MA within Malchut. For this degree must also be recorded, be present %0a> in Malchut. And these two degrees, MI and MA, are present in Malchut: Ml %0a> above and MA below. %0a> %0a> The Zohar calls Malchut the "world being revealed." That is to say, whatever %0a> Malchut reveals, the lower ones receive. Those individual attainments, individual %0a> sensations of the Light that descend from Malchut are what they call "their %0a> world." Similarly, whatever we feel in our sensory organs is what we call "our %0a> world." But this is nothing more than what we receive from Malchut of the %0a> lowest degree in the world of Assiya, Malchut of the previous degree. %0a> %0a> However, we should know that the actual notion of "our world" indicates %0a> the true attainment of the degree called "our world," i.e., man's sensation of his %0a> ultimate disconnection from the Creator, total helplessness, and the realization %0a> of his absolute egoism. One can attain this sensation only if the spiritual Light %0a> shines on him from Above, in contrast to which he will see his true spiritual %0a> state. However, in order to reach such a state, one must make great efforts in the %0a> study of Kabbalah so as to draw upon himself the influence of the Surrounding %0a> Light ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a> %0a> However, when man attains this state, he immediately raises such a request %0a> to the Creator that his MAN is not left unanswered, and he receives the strength %0a> to transcend "our world" and ascend with his properties to a Higher Degree— %0a> Malchut of the world of Assiya. And then it is she that becomes his world. %0a> %0a> Here we are speaking about very high degrees. The Malchut that is being %0a> revealed is Malchut of the world of Atzilut, Nukva de ZA. And the fact that The %0a> Zohar calls her "Supernal" indicates the state of Malchut when she attains the %0a> degree of MI during her ascent and clothing the Upper World, the Supernal %0a> Mother. Therefore, Malchut herself is then called "Supernal," and the degree of %0a> MA is, accordingly, called "lower." %0a> %0a> KNOWS ALL THE HOSTS BY NUMBER: number designates perfection. %0a> Light without a number indicates that the Light is imperfect, whereas the Light %0a> with a number is perfect. The action of ZA with regard to passing the Light from %0a> Bina to Malchut is described in the phrase: THE HEAVENS TELL OF THE %0a> CREATOR'S GREATNESS. THE HEAVENS (ZA) TELL (Hebrew-Mesaf>er, %0a> from the word Mispar— number, the Light's perfection). ZA passes this Light %0a> from AVI to Malchut, called THE CREATOR'S GREATNESS. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 113 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This Light is called 600,000, for the degree of Malchut designates units, %0a> the degree of ZA— tens, the degree of YESHSLT— hundreds, the degree of AVI— %0a> thousands, the degree of AA— tens of thousands. %0a> %0a> There are two parts in AVI: their own part, where they are regarded as %0a> thousands, and the part from Ohr Hochma that is received from Rosh de AA, where %0a> they are regarded as AA, that is, tens of thousands. However, they cannot be %0a> considered a complete degree of AA, but only as its VAK, for they clothe AA from %0a> the Peh down to the Chazeh. And since VAK = Vav Ketzavot = 6 Sefirot x 10 = 60, %0a> the degree of VAK de AA equals 60 x 10,000 = 600,000. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when Malchut ascends to AVI, she receives a complete, perfect %0a> number— 600,000, where 60 signifies that it is merely VAK, for Malchut has %0a> not yet reached Rosh de AA and that she still lacks this degree. And the degree %0a> of 10,000 refers to AA, the part that clothes in AVI, for AVI are VAK de AA. %0a> Therefore, Malchut contains the number 600,000. %0a> %0a> Thus, two degrees are recorded in Malchut: %0a> %0a> - MI, the degree of AVI that clothes in Malchut, through which Malchut %0a> receives the degree of the Upper World and is called accordingly, %0a> while the Light in it is called 600,000. %0a> %0a> - MA, the degree of YESHSL/T that clothes in Malchut, through which %0a> Malchut has a question, the sensation of lack of Ohr Hochma, and the %0a> request for its reception. Malchut is therefore called the "lower world." %0a> %0a> These two degrees create one Partzuf within Malchut: her part that is above %0a> the Chazeh is clothed in AVI, and her part that is below the Chazeh is clothed in %0a> YESHSL/T. Therefore, in the generations, in Malchut's descendants, each Partzuf %0a> consists of two parts (degrees): from the Upper Part (MI) there is a Light of %0a> 600,000, and from the lower part (lower world, MA), there is an absence of %0a> number (perfection) in each descendant. %0a> %0a> The phrase, THEY BRING FORTH INNUMERABLE HOSTS is not %0a> interpreted as infinitely big. Rather, "Innumerable" indicates the imperfection %0a> of the Light that is received in the lower part, as it comes from YESHSL/T, the %0a> degree that is without a number. %0a> %0a> Malchut's descendants are therefore defined as imperfect, as these two %0a> degrees exist in her as one, and are connected as one. Hence, there are two %0a> degrees in Malchut's descendants: the Upper One— 600,000, and the lower %0a> one— without a number. However, the lower one is defined as supplement to %0a> perfection and is not considered a flaw. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 114 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that the blessing of the seed, propagation depends %0a> only on the lower world, MA, without a number, as it is said in the Torah that %0a> Avraham complained that he is childless (Beresheet, 15:5), and the answer was: %0a> "Look now toward Heaven, and count the stars. Will you be able to count them? %0a> So shall be your descendants." From this we see that the blessing of the seed %0a> comes from the lack of a number, i.e., the name MA. %0a> %0a> Hence, after all the perfection that Malchut attains from the Light of AVI %0a> (Ml), Malchut has an additional blessing from MA, which is called the "lack of %0a> a number," and both these degrees are included in her descendants— the souls %0a> and generations. %0a> %0a> 20. All of these 600,000 and all their innumerable hosts, He calls the names. %0a> What does this mean: "calls the names?" If you say that He calls them by their %0a> names, it is not so, for then it would have said, "calls by name." However, %0a> when this degree does not ascend in the name Elokim, but is called MI, %0a> it does not beget and does not reveal those that are concealed within it. %0a> And although they were all concealed within it, meaning that even though %0a> the letters ELEH have already ascended, the "precious garment" of Ohr %0a> Hassadim is still concealed. And while it is concealed, it is not called by the %0a> name Elokim. For He created the letters ELEH and they ascended in His %0a> Name— clothed themselves in "precious garments" of Ohr Hassadim, as a %0a> result of which ELEH combine with MI, and are called Elo'im. Then, by %0a> the power of this name, He brought them forth in perfection, defined as %0a> CALLS THEIR NAMES, which means that He called by name and brought %0a> forth every type and species to exist in perfection. Hence, it is said: HE %0a> BROUGHT FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER— called them all by %0a> name, that is, by the name Elokim. %0a> %0a> It was already mentioned that the perfection of the Light, which is the %0a> Creator's name Elo-im, descends to the souls, generations, descendants, two %0a> degrees joined in one. This degree includes 600,000 from the Upper Degree, %0a> and innumerable hosts from the lower, and the Creator's name descends on %0a> both of them. %0a> %0a> The blessing of the seed depends entirely on MA, for it is determined by %0a> Ohr Hochma, as this Light designates perfection. Whereas the Light without %0a> a number, Ohr Hassadim, comes precisely from the name MA. As is already %0a> known, Ohr Hochma is accepted only when clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Until such %0a> clothing occurs, even though ELEH ascend to MI, the name Elokim (ELO-IM = %0a> ELEH + IM) does not act. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 115 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written that MI DOES NOT BEGET (ANY OFFSPRING), %0a> even though the point of Malchut left the thought (Bina) and descended back %0a> to her place, and all ten Sefirot and the Light returned to the Partzuf, THE %0a> NAME ELEH IS still CONCEALED, for she still cannot receive Hochma in the %0a> absence of Hassadim. %0a> %0a> However, BECAUSE HE CREATED ELEH, meaning that after He added a %0a> Zivug to the screen of MA (lower world, Malchut), there appeared Ohr Hassadim, %0a> called WITHOUT A NUMBER. And ELEH were filled with Ohr Hassadim, %0a> which means BARAH = CREATED ELEH, as clothing in Ohr Hassadim is called %0a> BARAH (creation). Only after this are they called ELOKIM, for only after the %0a> reception of Ohr Hassadim can they receive Ohr Hochma, called "the Light of a %0a> number," the Light of 600,000, as a result of which, the letters combine and %0a> form the complete name Elokim. %0a> %0a> The same perfection (clothing of Hochma in Hassadim) also extends to %0a> the souls and descendants that emerge from the name Elokim. AND HE IS %0a> CALLED BY THIS NAME: all that emerges is called by this name, with these %0a> properties He creates all descendants— Partzufim from His Zivug on Ohr Hochma. %0a> THE NAME 600,000 is Hochma, TOGETHER WITH HASSADIM, so that they %0a> will have the perfection of the name, so that Light will clothe Light, as they are %0a> clothed in the NAME. It is therefore written: SEE, I CALL THEM BY NAME, %0a> for "to call" means to revive and bring to perfection. %0a> %0a> 21. He asks, "What is the meaning of 'by the greatness of His might and %0a> wealth?'" This is the head of the degree, where all desires ascend and remain %0a> concealed. The strong one that ascended in the name Elokim, as it is said, %0a> "This is the secret of the Upper World, called MI." No man is missing from %0a> the 600,000 that He created by the power of this name. And because no one %0a> is missing from these 600,000, it follows that wherever the sons of Israel %0a> perished and were punished for their transgressions, we subsequently find %0a> that not one from the 600,000 had disappeared, so that everything would %0a> remain the same Above and below. And just as no one had disappeared from %0a> the 600,000 Above, no one has disappeared from this number below. %0a> %0a> FROM THE GREATNESS OF HIS MIGHT AND WEALTH signifies %0a> Keter de AVI, called the HEAD OF DEGREES. This is Bina of AA, which %0a> became Keter de Partzuf AVI, WHERE ALL DESIRES ASCEND (MAN of the %0a> lower ones), and receive all the degrees from there. This degree is filled with %0a> Ohr Hassadim, and exists in perfection even in the absence of Ohr Hochma, as its %0a> Light of Hassadim comes from GAR de BINA of AA. In other words, it has such %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 116 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> a powerful Light of Hassadim that although this degree emerged from Rosh de %0a> AA, it is not regarded as having left it, for it feels no need for Ohr Hochma. This %0a> degree, Keter of AVI, is the Rosh of all the degrees in the world of Atzilut, from %0a> where AVI, YESHSUT and ZON receive the Light. %0a> %0a> THE STRONG ONE IS THE SECRET OF THE UPPER WORLD, the %0a> property of MI that is present in Malchut, from where the number 600,000 %0a> descends, for she clothes the Upper World, AVI. Therefore, it is written that %0a> NO ONE DISAPPEARS FROM THOSE 600,000 because there Malchut %0a> receives Ohr Hochma, called "600,000 " Hence, it is said that AS NO ONE %0a> DISAPPEARED ABOVE, SO IT IS BELOW, for Malchut clothes AVI, described %0a> in the phrase: THE MOTHER ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a> OWN ADORNMENTS, by which Malchut becomes completely similar to AVI. %0a> And just as the Light of AVI is perfect (which is why it is called "600,000" and %0a> NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED, i.e., no lack of Ohr Hochma is felt), Malchut is %0a> perfect in this number, which means NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED below. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 22. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba said: "In the first four words of the Torah, IN THE %0a> BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED Et - Beresheet Barah Elokim %0a> Et, the first two words begin with the letter Bet, and the following two begin %0a> with Aleph" (The letter Aleph is pronounced both as "A" and "E"). It is said %0a> that when the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still %0a> concealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator %0a> gazed into the letters and played with them. %0a> %0a> In the language of Kabbalah, the same sentence appears in the following %0a> way: when the Creator (Bina) decided to create the world (ZON of the world %0a> of Atzilut), the Kelim of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva) were still in Bina. Hochma %0a> and Bina (Aba ve Ima - AVI) are called 2,000 years. Before the creation of the %0a> world (the birth of ZON), all the letters (the Kelim of ZON) existed in AVI in %0a> the form of MAN, and MAN always stimulates a desire in the Upper One to %0a> attend to it. %0a> %0a> With regard to the lower Partzuf, the Upper One is called the Creator, %0a> for it truly begets it, and whatever the lower one receives, comes directly from %0a> its Upper One. Moreover, one may say that this is all that the Upper One %0a> desires, its entire existence is meant exclusively for the lower one. Therefore, %0a> the Upper One always waits for the lower one's genuine request for the desire %0a> to ascend spiritually, which is called MAN. Provided this desire is sincere, the %0a> Upper One immediately responds and passes the powerful Light of correction %0a> to the lower one. %0a> %0a> Since the lower one is ZON of the world of Atzilut, and all that is below %0a> this Partzuf (all the worlds of ABYA and our world) is considered a part %0a> of it, AVI of the world of Atzilut constitute the Upper Partzuf. The desires %0a> and properties of ZON are called "letters," and here The Zohar explains the %0a> properties that ZON (the spiritual worlds and our world, we ourselves) were %0a> %0a> 117 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 118 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> created with, which properties are desirable, which require correction, and %0a> how this correction is achieved. %0a> %0a> Since the properties of the future Creature are determined by the %0a> Creator's purpose in creating it, it is said that even before the creation of %0a> the world, the Creator played with the letters. The word "played" suggests %0a> that the Creator's interaction with the Creature is like His game with the %0a> leviathan (the legendary sea monster), with the property that is opposite %0a> from Him. At the end of correction all the letters unite and combine into %0a> the one name of the Creator. %0a> %0a> The order of the Hebrew alphabet indicates the descent of the Direct %0a> Light from Above, the Inner Light that fills the Partzuf. The reverse order of %0a> the letters from the end of the alphabet alludes to the ascent of the Returning %0a> Light. The direct order of the alphabet refers to mercy, whereas the reverse %0a> order— to the strict law and restrictions on using egoistic desires. %0a> %0a> When Adam sinned, the letters detached themselves from him, and only %0a> the letters Shin and Tav (the Kelim for the Light of VAK of Nefesh) remained in %0a> him. The Kelim for the Light of Neshama are represented by the letters from %0a> Aleph to Yod; the letters from Yod to Ku/ are the Kelim for the Light of Ruach, and %0a> the letters Kuf and Reish— the Kelim for GAR of Nefesh— disappeared from him. %0a> %0a> This is why Adam gave his son, born after his sin, the name SHeT(Seth): Shin- %0a> Tav, according to the two last letters of the alphabet— the Kelim that remained %0a> in him. The Kli Shin-Tav are only fit for the Returning Light from below %0a> upwards, but not for the reception of the Upper Light from Above downwards. %0a> However, after it receives Yesod of Zeir Anpin (the letter Yod), Shin-Tav turns into a %0a> combination Shin- Yod- Tav. And if the Creator creates the world by the letter Bet, %0a> it then enters between Shin and Tav and forms the word Shahhat (Sh-B-T), the %0a> state of spiritual perfection, the goal of creation. For this reason, the first word %0a> in the Torah— Beresheet consists of: Bara (created) Sh(in)-Y(od)-T(av). %0a> %0a> 23. When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet %0a> came to Him in reverse order from last (Tav) to first (Aleph). The letter Tav %0a> entered first and said, "Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, %0a> to create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your %0a> ring, called EmeT (truth), that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You %0a> are called truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with %0a> the letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties." %0a> %0a> The Creator answered: "You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit %0a> the world that I conceived to be created by your properties, since you are %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 119 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> destined to be marked on the foreheads of the truly faithful who fulfill all %0a> of Torah from Aleph to Tav (from the first letter to the last), and perished %0a> because of you" (Talmud Bavli, Shabbat, 55) %0a> %0a> What does a particular name of the Creator mean? The name of the spiritual %0a> object indicates the way one can receive the Light that fills it, the way one can %0a> attain its spiritual degree. Generally speaking, the twenty-two letters are the ten %0a> Sefirot-Kelim in the Ibur (embryonic phase) of the future Partzuf in the Sefira %0a> Yesod, for that is where the screen of the embryo of the new Partzuf is located. %0a> That is why Yesod is called a "number," as it measures the size of a new Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Bearing in mind that each name determines specific spiritual properties %0a> and states of an object, one can understand what is meant by a change of name, %0a> place, or action. %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH is the basis of all the letters, but the filling of each letter clarifies the %0a> letter itself. The filling of a letter is heard as the letter is pronounced. As we read %0a> the letter Yod in the word HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey), we actually pronounce %0a> three sounds (y-o-d); although we write only one letter, the sounds "o-Vav" and %0a> "d-Dalet" are heard together with the sound "y." When we say "Hey," the sound %0a> "ey"— Yod or "ey"— follows the sound "h." Therein lies the clarification of the %0a> name HaVaYaH in the process of its emergence. %0a> %0a> The Creator's form-properties are revealed in His deeds; hence, the three %0a> lines in Bina (the Creator) are imprinted and act in His created beings (the lower %0a> worlds) as a seal and its imprint. Therefore, the name MB exists in Bina, as well %0a> as in ZA and Malchut. However, in ZA, this name is divided into the ten sayings %0a> and thirty-two forces of creation of Elokim, which create Malchut, the creature. %0a> %0a> Bina is designated by the letter Mem, Malchut— by Bet; the name MB designates %0a> the creation of Malchut by Bina. The letter Aleph designates ZA, which passes all %0a> the twenty-two letters (from Ale£>h to Tav) to Malchut (Bet). This is why Malchut %0a> is called ET (Aleph pronounced as 'E'-Tav). %0a> %0a> Malchut is the central part of creation and its purpose. She is the only %0a> creation and includes all the worlds with all that inhabits them, us included. %0a> Depending on its states, parts of Malchut or Malchut herself (which is one and %0a> the same) have different properties designated by the different letter combina- %0a> tions. For this reason, Malchut's parts receive various "codes" (combinations) %0a> of letters (properties) or names. %0a> %0a> All the words in the world originate here, in Malchut. There is not a %0a> single property in the world that is not included in Malchut. Each property of %0a> Malchut, each of the creatures (for all creatures are her parts) is designated by %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 120 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the property that distinguishes it from the others, by the unique set of letters- %0a> properties that forms its name. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called Shechina (Divinity), as she is filled with the Light, Shochen %0a> (Dweller— the Creator). The Creator is called Shochen when Malchut feels Him %0a> as such, within her. If man, being part of Malchut, purifies himself of egoism, %0a> either partially or completely, and thus fills his corrected desires with the Light %0a> (the Creator), he becomes part of the Shechina. %0a> %0a> Malchut consists of four parts that are named by their properties (also called %0a> faces): face of a lion, face of an ox, face of an eagle, and face of a man. Alternately, %0a> Malchut is likened to a spiritual kernel, surrounded by four shells, which corre- %0a> spond to the four Klipot (impure forces): Ruach Se'ara (Stormy Wind), Anan Gadol %0a> (Great Cloud), Esh Mitlakachat (Blazing Flame), and Noga (Radiance). %0a> %0a> Kabbalah can describe spiritual actions either as names of Sefirot and %0a> Partzufim or as names of HaVaYaH, EKYEH, and so forth, with their fillings %0a> and Gematriot (plural for Gematria— the numeric value). Although the most %0a> frequently used language is that of Sefirot and Partzufim, sometimes the %0a> language of HaVaYaH with its fillings can also be applied, even in parallel or %0a> simultaneously with the former. %0a> %0a> Most Kabbalistic terms are composite: Maatzil (the Creator) comes from the %0a> word Tzel (shadow), as the Creature emerges from the Creator's concealment, %0a> from His restrictions. Another name for the Creator is Boreh (combination of %0a> Bo— come and Re 'eh— see). %0a> %0a> A name denotes attainment. Upon attaining an object, man gives it a %0a> name. Similarly, man gives a name to the Creator according to the property %0a> that he attains, depending on how he feels the Creator. There are several %0a> kinds of names to the Creator, based on His properties. For example, the %0a> Creator's name EMET— "Truth" is based on the sensations of His Light within %0a> the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Below are the names of the Creator with the corresponding names of %0a> the Sefirot: %0a> %0a> - Keter: Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey (EKYEH) %0a> %0a> - Hochma: Yod-Hey (YA) %0a> %0a> - Bina: HaVaYaH with the punctuation Segol-Holam-Hirik, as Elokim: Yod %0a> %0a> (Yod-Vav-Dalet) - Hey (Hey-Yod) - Vav (Vav-Ahph-Vav) - Hey (Hey-Yod). %0a> %0a> - Hesed: Aleph-Lamed = EL (pronounced KEL) %0a> %0a> - Qevura: Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem (ELOKIM) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 121 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> - Tifferet: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey (HaVaYaH without punctuation) %0a> %0a> - Netzah: HaVaYaH TZEVAOT %0a> %0a> - Hod: ELOKJM TZEVAOT %0a> %0a> - Yesod: Shin-Dalet-Yod = SHADDAY %0a> %0a> - Malchut: ADONAY (pronounced ADM) %0a> %0a> Merging the two worlds, the Upper and the lower, is designated by the %0a> words HaVaYaH- ADM, implying the ascent of Malchut-ADM to the level of %0a> Bina-HaVaYaH with the punctuation of Elokim. %0a> %0a> The name ZA of HaVaYaH comes from the right line (Hesed), and the name %0a> ADNI, from the left line (Gevura). Joining of these two lines forms the middle %0a> line, where the Light of Hochma shines on account of the presence of the Light %0a> of Hassadim from the right line. Such state is designated by a combination of the %0a> two names Ha VaYaH-ADM: %0a> %0a> YOD-Aleph-HEY-Dalet-VAV-Nun-HEY-Yod. The union (Zivug) of ZA and his %0a> Nukva is designated by mixing the two names. %0a> %0a> HaVdYaH-ADM: Yod-Aleph-Hey-Dalet-Vav-Nun-Hey-Yod. The opening Yod %0a> indicates the Light of Hochma in ZA, the Yod at the end refers to the passing of %0a> this Light to Nukva. %0a> %0a> As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascended to Bina, and governs %0a> Bina and ZA with her desire. Since it is impossible to receive the Light of Hochma %0a> in the three Sefirot—Bina, ZA, and Malchut, which are governed by Malchut's %0a> egoistic desire, the Light of Hochma is absent in the Partzuf, and only the Light %0a> of Hassadim is present. %0a> %0a> This is designated in the following way: the letter Yod enters the word Light %0a> (Ohr contains the letters Aleph- Vav-Reish, signifying the Light of Hochma), and %0a> forms the word Avir (air, containing the letters Aleph- Vav-Yod-Reish), signifying %0a> the Light of Hassadim. If the Partzuf returns to the Gadlut state, the letter Yod %0a> exits it, and it is refilled with the Light of Hochma. Consequently, Avir (air) %0a> becomes Ohr (Light). %0a> %0a> Unfilled HaVaYaH designates Partzuf Keter. HaVaYaH with the filling of %0a> AB (72) designates Partzuf Hochma (AA). HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG (63) %0a> designates Partzuf Bina (AVI). Together, these three HaVaYaH form MB (42) %0a> letters— the sacred name of the Light that corrects the souls by its influence on %0a> the Kli, the screen. %0a> %0a> All that was created is the desire to receive pleasure, which we call "creature." %0a> Only this desire was created, and nothing else. All the worlds and all that inhabits %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 122 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> them, our world with everything within it, are but degrees of the desire to %0a> receive pleasure. The intensity of the desire determines its place in the spiritual %0a> realm, where all creation and our world— as its lowest point— are located. Man's %0a> actual location (the world, his spiritual degree) determines the particular kind %0a> of pleasure he desires, how he chooses to enjoy. %0a> %0a> In order for the creature to emerge from the Creator, the Light emanating %0a> from Him must descend through four stages, whereas the fifth stage already %0a> perceives itself as a separate and independent (from the Creator) desire to enjoy %0a> precisely the Light emanating from the Creator. %0a> %0a> Upon emerging from the Creator— a result of a sequential emanation of %0a> His Light— the desire to receive pleasure (Kli-vessel) also consists of five parts %0a> designated by the letters: the tip of the Yod, Yod, Hey, Vav, Hey. These five parts %0a> (four letters) are called the Creator's name HaVaYaH, because the Kli gives the %0a> Creator a name according to its sensation of Him, according to its sensation of %0a> the Light that fills it. The Light that fills the Kli is called "filling." %0a> %0a> The Kli created by the Creator is divided into five parts, called "worlds." %0a> Each world is in turn divided into five more parts, called Partzufim (faces). Then, %0a> each Partzuf (singular for Partzufim) consists of five parts called Sefirot. In all, %0a> there are 5x5x5= 125 spiritual objects or degrees from the lowest degree to %0a> the Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> Each Partzuf consists of five parts (Sefirot), designated by a dot and four %0a> letters: Keter-dot + Hochma-Yod + Bina-Hey + ZA-Vav + Malchut-Hey = HaVaYaH. %0a> The difference between each of the 125 Partzufim lies in the type of Light that fills %0a> them, whereas the core of the Kli, the letters HaVaYaH, remain the same. A desire %0a> cannot appear unless the Creator's Light had previously passed through the five %0a> stages; only the fifth stage is considered a birth of a new creation (desire). %0a> %0a> The whole universe (all the worlds) is nothing but the ten Sefirot or the %0a> Creator's name HaVaYaH. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIRA %0a> %0a> %0a> LETTER %0a> %0a> %0a> PARTZUF %0a> %0a> %0a> WORLD %0a> %0a> %0a> LIGHT %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> A dot, the tip of the letter Yod %0a> %0a> %0a> Galgalta %0a> %0a> %0a> AK %0a> %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Yod %0a> %0a> %0a> AB %0a> %0a> %0a> Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> SAG %0a> %0a> %0a> Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Vav %0a> %0a> %0a> MA %0a> %0a> %0a> Yetzira %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> BON %0a> %0a> %0a> Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 123 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> A filling of HaVaYaH with Light is referred to as its revelation. Thus, the %0a> letters emerge from the state of concealment when they are not filled. In all there %0a> are five Partzufim: Keter (Galgalta), AB, SAG, MA and BON. The first— Partzuf %0a> Keter— is the main one and the source of all the rest. Its ten Sefirot is plain (inner) %0a> HaVaYaH, for each of the four letters of its HaVaYaH comes outside, revealing %0a> a new Partzuf that clothes it. %0a> %0a> So then, out of Partzuf Keter-Galgalta, from the letter Yod comes Partzuf %0a> Hochma (AB), from the letter Hey— Partzuf Bina (SAG), from the letter Vav— %0a> Partzuf ZA (MA), and from the letter Hey— Partzuf Malchut (BON). Thus Partzuf %0a> Keter is designated by plain HaVaYaH, and the Partzufim that clothe it are %0a> designated by filled HaVaYaH. The recording of HaVaYaH with the Light %0a> that fills it is called Miluy (filling). For the purposes of brevity when naming %0a> a Partzuf, the notion of Gematria was introduced. Gematria is the numerical %0a> value of the Light that fills the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Wisdom (Hochma) is called calculation (Heshbon), Gematria. A calculation %0a> is made only in a place where Light is received: (i) a preliminary calculation is %0a> made as to how much Light the Partzuf can receive for the Creator's sake; (ii) %0a> the Light is received in accordance with the calculation; (iii) calculation of the %0a> received amount, called Miluy, Gematria. %0a> %0a> Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma without the Light of Hassadim, %0a> and in that event, Hochma cannot shine in her. Then Malchut ascends to Bina %0a> and becomes like an embryo inside of her, by which she receives the right %0a> line— Hassadim. Upon joining the past and the present states, Malchut receives %0a> Hochma into Hassadim, and the Light of Hochma shines in her. All these actions %0a> of Malchut are accompanied by calculations, called Gematriot. %0a> %0a> The Gematria (numerical value) of the Partzuf unfilled with the Light, the %0a> Gematria of the empty HaVaYaH is as follows: %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH = Yod + He;y + Vav + Hey = 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26. The Gematria of a %0a> filled HaVaYaH is formed by filling each letter; In Hebrew, each letter has a full %0a> name: A-Aleph, B-Bet, etc.. Hence, there are four kinds of fillings in HaVaYaH: %0a> 1) AB, 2) SAG, 3) MA and 4) BON. %0a> %0a> 1) HaVaYaH with the filling of AB: %0a> Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a> Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a> Vav. Vav + Yod + Vav = 6 + 10 + 6 = 22 %0a> Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 124 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In all: 20 + 15 + 22 + 15 = 72 = AB, where "A" designates the letter Ayin = 70, %0a> and not Aleph = 1. HaVaYaH filled with this Light is called Partzuf AB (Partzuf %0a> Hochma), for the letter Yod with its filling signifies the Light of Wisdom, Ohr %0a> Hochma. Such a filling is called "HaVaYaH with the filling of Yod." %0a> %0a> 2) HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG: the Partzuf that is filled with Light of %0a> Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, is called SAG, for its Gematria is this: %0a> %0a> SAG = Samech (60) + Gimel (3) = 63: %0a> Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a> Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a> Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 %0a> He?: Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a> %0a> In all: 20 + 15 + 13 + 15 = 63 = Samech + Gimel = SAG %0a> %0a> If the Kelim and their filling originate from the first restriction, the letter %0a> Yod is present in the filling of HaVaYaH. And if the Kelim are filled with the %0a> Light of the second restriction, it is the letter Aleph, present in the filling of %0a> HaVaYaH. The difference between the Gematriot of AB and SAG lies in the %0a> filling of the letter Vav. Gematria of Vav in Partzuf AB is twenty-two (from the %0a> filling of Ohr Hochma), whereas Gematria of Vav in Partzuf SAG is thirteen (from %0a> the filling of Ohr Hassadim). From the aforesaid, it is clear that Partzuf AB %0a> originates from the first restriction, whereas the letter Vav (ZA) in Partzuf SAG %0a> originates from the second restriction. %0a> %0a> 3) HaVaYaH with the filling of MA: %0a> Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a> %0a> Hey: Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a> %0a> Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 13 %0a> %0a> Hey. Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a> %0a> Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 6 + 13 + 6 = 45 = Mem (40) + Hey (5) = %0a> MA (the letter Hey is pronounced as "ah"). %0a> %0a> 4) HaVaYaH with the filling of BON: %0a> Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a> %0a> Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a> Vav. Vav + Vav =12 %0a> Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a> %0a> Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 52 = Nun (50) + %0a> Bet (2), pronounced as BON for easier articulation. This is the Gematria of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 125 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf Malchut, and it is equivalent to twice the value of the unfilled HaVaYaH: %0a> HaVaYaH = 26, and 26 x 2 = 52 = MA. %0a> %0a> Partzuf Malchut cannot receive the Creator's Light due to the absence of a %0a> screen. Instead, it can only passively receive what Partzuf ZA gives it. Hence, the %0a> twofold twenty-six indicates that whatever Malchut has comes to her from ZA. %0a> %0a> From the four kinds of HaVaYaH, it becomes clear that the root of creation %0a> is neither Partzuf Hochma nor Bina, but only ZA, as it is the first Partzuf built on %0a> the second restriction. %0a> %0a> The primary ten Sefirot are located in Partzuf Keter, whereas Partzufim AB, %0a> SAG, MA, and BON are merely branches stemming from the first Partzuf. %0a> However, when the Light spreads within the Partzuf, it contains five inner %0a> Lights NRNHY and five outer Lights. The five outer Lights of Bina come out %0a> of the right ear, and the five inner Lights of Bina come out of the left. The five %0a> outer Lights of ZA come out of the right nostril, and the five inner Lights of %0a> ZA come out of the left. %0a> %0a> Since the two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) are remote from one another, %0a> as a branch in our world, man's ear holes are also separated and distanced. The %0a> two nostrils are separated by a smaller distance, whereas the five inner and outer %0a> Lights of the common Light of the Peh (mouth) come out of the same opening. %0a> Thus, as they exit the mouth, they collide and interweave, and as a result of their %0a> collisions, letters (Kelim) are born. %0a> %0a> Since twenty-two letters originate from Bina-SAG = Samech + Gimel = 60 + %0a> 3 = 63, the opening through which they come out is called 63 + 22 = 85 = Peh + %0a> Hey = PeH (mouth). The letters come out of the Peh of ZA, for Yesod of Ima is %0a> located there. %0a> %0a> We received our entire Torah, all of the knowledge about the spiritual %0a> worlds, from our Great Patriarchs, who ascended spiritually above our world, %0a> sensed the Upper Worlds, and described them to us. This is how we received the %0a> whole Torah— both the written and the oral parts. %0a> %0a> We cannot imagine the spiritual world because our sensory organs cannot %0a> detect it. Thus, to describe the objects and concepts still unattainable by us, %0a> Kabbalists use several techniques, languages. The whole Torah speaks only %0a> of the creation, governing, and correction of the world; never about history, %0a> geography, or anything else. As it is said in the Torah itself, the Torah is the %0a> sacred names, that is, manifestations of the Creator, the degrees and methods %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 126 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> jbalists, those who ascend to the spiritual world and thus establisl %0a> r, convey this information to us using four langua %0a> %0a> age of the TaNaKh (Torah— Pentateuch, Nevi'im— Pre %0a> ets, Ketuvim— Writings/Hagiographa). This is the language of tl %0a> written Torah. %0a> %0a> 2. The language of laws. %0a> %0a> 3. The language of legends, %0a> language of Sefirot and Partzufim— the language of Kabbalah. %0a> %0a> languages speak about the same thing— the attainment of the ( %0a> by us, those living in this world. For this is the sole purpose of our creation, and %0a> according to the Creator's design, we must devote all of our physical, mental, %0a> and spiritual abilities only to it. And if we were to aspire only to this, we would %0a> naturally use our language only for this purpose. After all, everything that is %0a> an to us is only for the fulfillment of this exclusive goal— the attainment i %0a> )r, while still in this life. %0a> %0a> why the first language mastered by humankind was %0a> However, as they distanced from fulfilling their mission, humankind cor %0a> other languages. All the other languages in the world have their inner meaning, %0a> too, but since their alphabets were not revealed to us by Kabbalists, we study the %0a> spiritual forces depicted in the Hebrew alphabet, the source of all the others. %0a> %0a> Every Partzuf is divided into two parts: right and left. The right part consists of %0a> Ramach = Reish - Mem - Chet = 248 parts (organs) filled with the Light of Hassadim; %0a> and the left part consists of Shasah = Shin - Samech - Hey = 365 parts (tendons) %0a> filled with the Light of Hochma. ZA is called a "voice"; he is generally the Light of %0a> Hassadim. But when he joins with Malchut, called "speech," Malchut receives the %0a> Light of Hassadim with Hochma from ZA, and thus "speech" is formed. %0a> %0a> The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a> names of ZA originate from the 70 (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is called %0a> "Heaven" and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also called Ruach, %0a> owing to the Light of Ruach within them, which ascends to Bina (ears) and %0a> transforms into sound: Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a> %0a> There is a difference between language and alphabet, as in our world there %0a> are people who can speak, but cannot read or write. The most ancient spoken %0a> language is that of the TaNaKh, which dates back to Adam. The language of laws %0a> originated from it, followed by the language of legends. All of these languages %0a> combined and each of them in particular are used in our holy scriptures. %0a> %0a> The language of Kabbalah was the last to develop. It is the most difficult %0a> language, since proper understanding of it requires sensing the spiritual categories %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 127 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> that this language narrates. Kabbalah is also the most precise language of all. It is %0a> the only language that can accurately render all the spiritual information. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> learn it and grasp its information. And since for many generations there %0a> were only a few Kabbalists, unconnected with one another, the language of %0a> Kabbalah was the last to evolve. Even today it can only be "learned" directly %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Initially, Kabbalists enciphered their knowledge of the spiritual world as %0a> letters, whose outlines reflected the interrelationships of spiritual forces. In %0a> other words, each spiritual degree is characterized by a unique interrelationship %0a> of spiritual forces. By assigning each spiritual property with a particular symbol, %0a> one can depict the interrelationship, as well as the general product of the union %0a> of spiritual forces of each degree, i.e., its essence. %0a> %0a> Thus, Kabbalists created the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The %0a> Zohar pays much attention to analyzing the connection between the letters, which %0a> helps a student to synthesize his knowledge and find new ways of discovering %0a> spiritual forces and their actions within. %0a> %0a> As our forefather Avraham writes in his Book of Creation (Sefer Yetzira), letters %0a> represent the stones from which the building-word is constructed. As our sages %0a> tell us, the world was created with the letters of the "sacred language," each letter %0a> representing a certain holy, spiritual, altruistic force of creation. %0a> %0a> The properties of this force are reflected in the letter's outline, its %0a> importance with regard to other letters, its potential combinations with the %0a> others, its potential punctuation marks, its crowns and notations, its numerical %0a> value (Gematria) and variations. %0a> %0a> However, this only concerns separate letters and their combinations. There %0a> are also certain rules that enable us to determine the properties of spiritual %0a> forces not from letters, but from whole words. Moreover, quite often we can %0a> replace letters or even parts of a word with similar ones. %0a> %0a> The language itself, the roots of its words, indicate the properties of the %0a> spiritual object they describe. For example, Adam originated from Adama— earth, %0a> which emphasizes his insignificance, and from the word Adameh— similar (to the %0a> Upper One), which emphasizes his eminence. The name Yaakov comes from the %0a> word Ekev— to get around (Esau). There are many such examples in the Torah, for %0a> everything is named after its root, as after the patronymic name of one's father. %0a> %0a> Once we have established that certain combinations of letters (Kelim, %0a> language of letters) can be used instead of the language of Sefirot and Partzufim %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> through %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> from a Kabbalist-teacher. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 128 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> when describing spiritual actions, the entire description of the spiritual worlds %0a> amounts to portraying objects and actions in the form of letters and their %0a> combinations. This is how the whole of the Torah is written, in words. Thus, %0a> %0a> a) The shape of each letter and the elements of its structure indicate %0a> all the properties and the general state of a spiritual object, Sefira, or %0a> Partzuf, which this particular letter depicts; %0a> %0a> b) The order of letters in a word indicates the connection between %0a> spiritual objects, Sefirot, and their shared properties and actions. %0a> Attainment of a word's spiritual meaning signifies an ascent to the %0a> spiritual level of the object. When that happens, he who attains %0a> it becomes this very word, assumes its name. Man's name keeps %0a> changing as he ascends the spiritual degrees; it is determined by %0a> the degree he is on, as he assumes the name of that degree. It is %0a> therefore said that everyone can become like Moshe, i.e., attain the %0a> degree called "Moshe"; %0a> %0a> c) The word itself in its "corporeal" reading, its "corporeal" meaning %0a> indicates the spiritual root and its branch— consequence in our world; %0a> %0a> d) A combination of words indicates an entire spiritual process, which, %0a> as a rule, has a corresponding action (commandment) in our world. %0a> %0a> Names change depending on the aspect that requires clarification: %0a> %0a> a) By elements of Sefirot: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter - has none %0a> %0a> Hochma - fire %0a> %0a> Bina - water %0a> %0a> ZA - air %0a> %0a> Malchut - earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> b) By colors: %0a> %0a> Keter - has none %0a> %0a> Hochma - white - the basis of all colors %0a> %0a> Bina - red - most prominent %0a> %0a> ZA - green - most perfect %0a> %0a> Malchut - black - cannot be changed by any other color %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 129 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Colors are present only in the Guf (body) of the Partzuf, but never in the %0a> Rosh (head). These colors are projected onto Malchut from Above, and she passes %0a> them on to all the lower ones. %0a> %0a> c) By lines: %0a> %0a> Hesed - right - white %0a> %0a> Gevura - left - red %0a> %0a> Tifferet - central, includes all the colors - green %0a> %0a> Quite often, colors and elements are used instead of the names of Sefirot %0a> and their properties: fire, water, air, earth (The Zohar, Vayera, item 32). Malchut %0a> is called "earth," but Malchut that ascends with her properties to Bina is called %0a> "earth of the Temple." In the Temple, the four sides of the world— Hochrna, Bina, %0a> Tifferet and Malchut join the four elements of the world— fire, water, air and %0a> earth. Out of the two points of Bina and Malchut, which are joined together, the %0a> Creator made one Partzuf— Adam. %0a> %0a> The four foundations of the world, or the four sides of the world: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Fire %0a> %0a> %0a> North %0a> %0a> %0a> Shuruk %0a> %0a> %0a> Left Line %0a> %0a> %0a> Gevura %0a> %0a> %0a> Air %0a> %0a> %0a> East %0a> %0a> %0a> Hirik %0a> %0a> %0a> Middle Line %0a> %0a> %0a> Tifferet %0a> %0a> %0a> Water %0a> %0a> %0a> South %0a> %0a> %0a> Holam %0a> %0a> %0a> Right Line %0a> %0a> %0a> Hesed %0a> %0a> %0a> Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> West %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut- receives from all %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Four fundamental metals are created as a result of a Zivug of the four %0a> foundations with Malchut; gold, silver, copper and iron. All of these names, as %0a> well as many others, are used in the Torah instead of the names of the ten Sefirot. %0a> Therefore, although the languages of the Torah, legends, the Talmud, and the %0a> Scriptures are extraordinarily vivid, only the concise language of Kabbalah %0a> provides an accurate description of the spiritual worlds. %0a> %0a> The four kinds of symbols used with letters: %0a> %0a> Taamim— tone modulations used in pronouncing letters— signify the Direct %0a> Light, which spreads from Above downwards in the body of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Nekudot— letter punctuation marks— signify the Light during its gradual exit %0a> from the body of the Partzuf from below upwards. %0a> %0a> Tagin— crowns above the letters— represent Reshimot (reminiscences/records) %0a> of the previously present Light (Taamim). Tagin originate from GAR de Bina. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 130 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Otiot— letters— represent Reshimot of the Light's exit from the body of the %0a> Partzuf (Nekudot). Letters originate from Zat de Bina. %0a> %0a> The ten Sefirot are divided into three primary parts— Taamim, Nekudot, %0a> and Otiot: %0a> %0a> Taamim - Keter %0a> %0a> Nekudot - Hochma %0a> %0a> Otiot - ZAT de Bina and ZON %0a> %0a> According to the Light in them, Sefirot are divided into: %0a> %0a> Taamim - Hochma %0a> Nekudot - Bina %0a> Otiot - ZON %0a> %0a> The letters were created in the following order: the letter Aleph, which was %0a> initially on the right side, begot the letter Shin, which emerged from it and %0a> moved to the left side. The letter Shin consists of three sides: the left, the middle, %0a> and the right. The letter Vav is thereby formed by three letters, and upon joining %0a> with Aleph, it formed the word Aleph-Shin = ESH (fire) in the left side. %0a> %0a> Out of the interaction of the right and the left sides these two letters came %0a> forth in contradiction between them, as the right line includes water, while the %0a> left line includes fire. Their collisions begot the letters Reish, Vav, and Chet, %0a> which formed the word Ruach (wind). This wind entered between the two sides %0a> (fire and water) and joined them together, thereby establishing the order of the %0a> first letters and their perfection. %0a> %0a> At first, The Zohar offers a general description of the three lines in ZA, %0a> designated by the three names of the Creator: El, Elokim and Elokeinu, and then %0a> proceeds to clarify the descent of the degrees of filling ZA and Malchut with %0a> the Light of Hochma in the form of letter combinations, in the order of the %0a> degrees' descent from Above downwards. Mayim - water, Esh - fire, Ruach - %0a> wind constitute the three lines in ZA from AVI. This is why the first letters in %0a> ZA come from AVI. %0a> %0a> Then the following combinations emerged: Aleph revealed Mem from its %0a> right side, so Mem stands to the left line of Aleph. Mem revealed Shin as the %0a> middle line, as Mem initially consists of the left line, for it exists in the form of a %0a> concealed letter Mem in the word Elokim, which pertains to the left line, and so %0a> forth. This is how all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were born. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba 131 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE LETTERS %0a> OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LETTERS %0a> %0a> %0a> NAME %0a> %0a> %0a> PRONUNCIATION %0a> %0a> %0a> GEMATRIA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Aleph %0a> %0a> %0a> [a], [e] %0a> %0a> %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> 3 %0a> %0a> %0a> Bet %0a> %0a> %0a> b,v %0a> %0a> %0a> 2 %0a> %0a> %0a> a %0a> %0a> %0a> Gimel %0a> %0a> %0a> g %0a> %0a> %0a> 3 %0a> %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> Dalet %0a> %0a> %0a> d %0a> %0a> %0a> 4 %0a> %0a> %0a> n %0a> %0a> %0a> Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> [a], [e] %0a> %0a> %0a> 5 %0a> %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> Vav %0a> %0a> %0a> v, [u], [o] %0a> %0a> %0a> 6 %0a> %0a> %0a> T %0a> %0a> %0a> Zayin %0a> %0a> %0a> z %0a> %0a> %0a> 7 %0a> %0a> %0a> n %0a> %0a> %0a> Chet %0a> %0a> %0a> h %0a> %0a> %0a> 8 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Tet %0a> %0a> %0a> t %0a> %0a> %0a> 9 %0a> %0a> %0a> i %0a> %0a> %0a> Yod %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 10 %0a> %0a> %0a> (1)3 %0a> %0a> %0a> Chaf %0a> %0a> %0a> h,k %0a> %0a> %0a> 20 %0a> %0a> %0a> %3c? %0a> %0a> %0a> Lamed %0a> %0a> %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> 30 %0a> %0a> %0a> (0)8 %0a> %0a> %0a> Mem %0a> %0a> %0a> m %0a> %0a> %0a> 40 %0a> %0a> %0a> 0)3 %0a> %0a> %0a> Nun %0a> %0a> %0a> n %0a> %0a> %0a> 50 %0a> %0a> %0a> D %0a> %0a> %0a> Samech %0a> %0a> %0a> s %0a> %0a> %0a> 60 %0a> %0a> %0a> V %0a> %0a> %0a> Ayin %0a> %0a> %0a> [a], [e] %0a> %0a> %0a> 70 %0a> %0a> %0a> (1)3 %0a> %0a> %0a> Peh %0a> %0a> %0a> p, ph %0a> %0a> %0a> 80 %0a> %0a> %0a> (r)s %0a> %0a> %0a> Tzadik %0a> %0a> %0a> tz %0a> %0a> %0a> 90 %0a> %0a> %0a> p %0a> %0a> %0a> Kuf %0a> %0a> %0a> k %0a> %0a> %0a> 100 %0a> %0a> %0a> 1 %0a> %0a> %0a> Reish %0a> %0a> %0a> r %0a> %0a> %0a> 200 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Shin %0a> %0a> %0a> sh, s %0a> %0a> %0a> 300 %0a> %0a> %0a> n %0a> %0a> %0a> Tav %0a> %0a> %0a> t %0a> %0a> %0a> 400 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 13 2 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The letters Aleph and Ayin do not have any particular sound, and only %0a> the accompanying punctuation mark determines their pronunciation. %0a> %0a> The letters Bet, Chaf and Peh with a dot inside them are pronounced %0a> as "b," "k," and "p." The absence of a dot changes their pronunciation to %0a> "v," "ch" and "f." %0a> %0a> The letter Hey is not pronounced, but rather aspirated. %0a> %0a> The shapes of the letters Mem, Nun, Tzadik, Peh, Chaf (pronounced %0a> MANTZEPACH) change when placed at the end of a word, as seen in the %0a> table of letters. %0a> %0a> The shape, external form of letters: the protruding element of a letter indicates %0a> that the Light in this part of the letter is greater than in the other. The filling %0a> (Miluy) indicates the height of the degree. A punctuation mark (Nikud) indicates %0a> the origin of each part of the Partzuf. whether it came from the Upper Partzuf (and %0a> constitutes its part in the present one), from the lower Partzuf, or from itself. %0a> %0a> The Kelim-Sefirot themselves are called "letters," and their punctuation %0a> marks (Nekudot) indicate the Light that enters and exits them. The Light of Bina, %0a> ZA, and Malchut can enter the Kelim, but the Light of Keter or Hochma cannot. %0a> A dot above a letter (Holam) signifies the Lights Keter and Hochma, which never %0a> clothe the Kli, hence the location of the dot above the letter. %0a> %0a> Two horizontally positioned dots (Tzere) allude to Sefirot Hochma and Bina, %0a> that Bina does not receive the Light of Hochma, and contains only the Light of %0a> Hassadim, the Light of Mercy (AVI back-to-back). Bina herself is also called Tzere, %0a> for ZA receives everything from her. If there is a third dot (Segol) between these %0a> two dots, it means that ZA raised his request for the Light of Hochma to AVI. %0a> Such a request of ZA in AVI is called Daat. Daat receives the Light of Hochma %0a> in order to pass it on to ZA. The punctuation mark Kamatz (a "T" shaped mark %0a> under the letter) indicates that ZA collects (Mekabetz) the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> A dot indicates Malchut with a reflecting screen, but not a receiving one. %0a> Such a form testifies to the absence of Light in the Kli; it is merely a black dot, %0a> as the law of restriction rules over it. %0a> %0a> The Sefira Hod is an inclusion of Malchut's properties into ZA, out of which %0a> ZA makes a whole Partzuf Malchut. The letter Hey in the word Hod signifies Keter %0a> in Malchut, and the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut are located among the impure %0a> forces that cling to them. This is designated by an elongated leg of the letter Kuf %0a> (dipping below the line), which indicates that the impure forces receive their %0a> strength from the spiritually pure forces through this element, the Kuf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 133 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The white background is a plain, indistinguishable and thereby imperceptible %0a> Light (by us). Whatever we can distinguish may only be expressed by restricting %0a> the diffusion of this white color. The forms and degrees of its restriction are %0a> called letters. That is why we see black outlines on white background, and attain %0a> only the black restrictions. %0a> %0a> We can describe the diffusion of Light in the worlds using attraction and %0a> restriction of the Light. And these two forces must act simultaneously. Similarly, %0a> when we perceive something in our sensory organs, we only sense it by way of %0a> restriction, as the object's surface or a light wave collides with our sensory organ, %0a> which restricts its expansion, and can thereby perceive it. %0a> %0a> The spiritual roots of the forms are as follows: A circumference originates %0a> from the first restriction of the Light in the world of Em Sof (Infinity), the %0a> first restriction on the diffusion of Light. Since this restriction was equal and %0a> uniform, it assumed the form of a circumference. %0a> %0a> A vertical line, length without width, signifies that the notion is unattainable %0a> by us, and is therefore called a "thin line" of the diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a> The Light of Hochma can only be received with the help of the screen in Malchut, %0a> which creates Returning Light that clothes the Light of Hochma. Therefore, the %0a> Upper Light that comes to the Kli is called a line. %0a> %0a> A horizontal line, width without height: when a vertical line— the diffusion %0a> of the Light of Hochma from Above downwards— collides with the screen, their %0a> collision (of desires) compels the vertical line to shift into the horizontal line (to %0a> the right), resulting in a shape of the English letter L. Its width is determined by the %0a> force of the Returning Light that ascends from the screen from below upwards. %0a> %0a> A rectangle is formed by the interlacing of the descending Light of Hochma %0a> and the Returning Light: five vertical descending lines— five Sefirot of the Light %0a> of Hochma and five horizontal lines from right to left— five Sefirot of the Light %0a> of Hassadim. The size of the rectangle's side is called Amah, consisting of five %0a> parts— Tefachim (plural for Tefach). (Both Amah and Tefach are distance measuring %0a> units.) This is why we describe the Kli as a rectangle. %0a> %0a> The two kinds of diffusion of Light, the Light of Hochma and the Returning %0a> Light, are called the right and the left cheeks, respectively, which turn into the %0a> upper and the lower lips. Since, after the first restriction, the Light may not be %0a> received in Malchut, the Returning Light is only received in four parts of the Kli, %0a> not in five. This is why there are 4 x 4 = 16 teeth on the lower jaw and 16 teeth %0a> on the upper jaw (The Returning Light stems from resistance, from "chewing" %0a> the Light before receiving it inside). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 134 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In the second restriction, a Triangle is formed, as Malchut ascends to Bina %0a> and forms a slanted line.

A plain name refers to Aviut Shoresh (zero thickness) with the Light of %0a> Ne/esh. Plain letters refer to a Partzuf with a screen of Aviut Aleph. %0a> %0a> The truly faithful, who believe in the three fundamentals: the Creator, His %0a> Providence and the Torah, need the two lines to be in constant balance for their %0a> spiritual advancement. The left line is wisdom, the Light of Hochma that enters %0a> the desire to receive, which pertains to the left side, and the right line is faith, %0a> the Light of Hassadim (mercy), the altruistic desire to bestow. %0a> %0a> Existing in knowledge only means that man is under the rule of the %0a> impure forces (Klipa) of the left side, which renders him totally unable to %0a> feel the spiritual, leaving him in spiritual darkness. Alternately, existing only %0a> in faith means that man is under the rule of the impure forces (Klipa) of the %0a> right side that convinces him that he has achieved perfection, that there is %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 136 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> nothing else to work on, nothing to correct within him. This, too, denies him %0a> the opportunity to advance. %0a> %0a> The Zohar continues: And the Creator answered further (the letter Tav): %0a> "The word MaveT (death) ends with you. And since these are your properties, %0a> you are not suitable for Me to create the world with you." Immediately following, %0a> the letter Tav departed from Him. %0a> %0a> The moment the Creator set about creating the world-ZON by selecting %0a> their properties, all twenty-two letters of ZON appeared before Him, starting %0a> from the last— Tav, and ending with the first, Aleph— the head of all letters. The %0a> reason for the letters coming in reverse order is that they constitute the MAN %0a> of ZON, the Kelim of ZON, which emerge from below upwards. The usual %0a> alphabetical order corresponds to the Light (MAD), which descends from %0a> Above downwards. But the order of MAN is opposite to that of MAD, for it %0a> ascends from below upwards. %0a> %0a> Letters are none other than desires, properties, and thoughts that, in man's %0a> opinion, are suitable for the attainment of the spiritual, the Creator, of His %0a> Providence. Man skips from one thought to another: one moment he thinks that %0a> it is possible to attain the Upper Worlds with one property, next he believes he %0a> can enter the spiritual realms by mastering another property, then he begins to %0a> stubbornly observe all the commandments and pray zealously, or disregards all %0a> the actions and plunges into contemplation and reading. Sometimes he craves %0a> only knowledge, and sometimes only faith, right down to fanaticism. %0a> %0a> Just as there are two extremes in our world— knowledge and faith, in the %0a> spiritual world, as man now consciously ascends the spiritual ladder to the %0a> Creator, there is spiritual work in the attainment of knowledge and faith. %0a> Hence, Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag's commentary on The Zohar is entitled The %0a> Sulam (The Ladder). %0a> %0a> Each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters represents a certain property. At times %0a> it seems that the property of the letter Tav is suitable for the attainment of the %0a> spiritual; at times he believes that some other letter is more appropriate. This %0a> occurs because in the process of his spiritual ascent, man begins to increasingly %0a> understand the true Goal of creation and the Creator, which is exactly what is %0a> demanded of him. %0a> %0a> Thus, he continues to sort through it all, until his search yields the truth: %0a> only with the help of the letter Bet, which stands at the beginning of the word %0a> Berachah (blessing)— contact with the Creator,— only with the help of this force %0a> can one achieve the goal. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 137 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> tuaiiy %0a> 5 into %0a> tually %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar tells us how the letters— properties, forces, and desires- %0a> come to the Creator. By offering up his prayer (MAN), man asks for some %0a> property that seems like a real goal to him. And each letter tries to prove that %0a> it is best suited for the attainment of the sensation of the Creator and merging %0a> with Him. But the Creator shows that the best and the only letter is Bet, as only %0a> it can help man to establish contact with Him. This is why the Torah begins %0a> with this letter. %0a> %0a> The description of the spiritual forces designated by each letter is incredibly %0a> deep, and in order to attain full clarity we need to bridge several other preliminary %0a> explanations: the creation of the world includes its existence and process of %0a> perfection so that the world could attain the goal for which it was created. %0a> %0a> The Creator created the world consisting of two contrasting forces; against %0a> each pure, altruistic force, He created an impure, egoistic one, which is its equal %0a> and opposite. Just as there are four pure worlds ABYA, the Creator created %0a> opposite them four impure worlds ABYA. %0a> %0a> Therefore, in our world— the last degree of the world of Assiya— a spiritually %0a> lved person that senses the Creator and has entered with his properties %0a> piritually pure world, looks no different from an egoistic and spirit %0a> developed person, who has not attained the spiritual realm. This means tha %0a> one who does not perceive the spiritual is totally unable to differentiate between %0a> piritual purity and impurity. %0a> %0a> We see that in our world one cannot advance with the help of the pure %0a> forces. On the contrary, it is his egoistic aspirations that provide man with the %0a> strength to conquer everything in the world. How often do we see fervent fanatics %0a> immersed in their impure desires to capture for themselves both this world and %0a> the next, whereas one that aspires to the Creator has no strength for even a %0a> slightest spiritual movement! In our world there is no proof or confirmation %0a> that man advances on the right path. And under no circumstances should one %0a> draw conclusions based on one's life experience or "common sense." %0a> %0a> So how can a person in this world exist and advance towards the Goal of %0a> creation if he is unable to tell good from bad, pure from impure? There is one %0a> sign by which one can distinguish purity from impurity: impure forces bear %0a> no spiritual fruit. Thus, those that advance through the impure worlds ABYA %0a> do not attain anything spiritual, whereas those who are connected to the pure %0a> forces reap spiritual fruit on their path. %0a> %0a> As it is explained in the "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot" (items %0a> 19-23), if man advances along the right path, he attains the secrets of the Torah in %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 5 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 138 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> five years. The Creator helps those who wish to acquire altruistic i %0a> above their own requests, and thus one attains the desired goal, %0a> below, man aspires to the Creator with his small desire (MAN), and from Above, %0a> the Creator pours onto him tremendous spiritual desires and strength (MAD). %0a> %0a> This is the only opportunity to check whether or not the path that one %0a> is on is correct, whether it leads to altruism or to even bigger egoism.

Each of the twenty-two letters represents a spiritual degree in the worlds %0a> ABYA, and each believes that its pure spiritual properties are most suitable for %0a> the task, that by attaining its degree and acquiring its properties, the inhabitants %0a> of the world will be able to elevate the pure forces over the impure ones, so much %0a> so that they will reach the end of correction, the Goal of creation. %0a> %0a> However, the Creator answers each letter that against it are the corresponding %0a> impure forces, and therefore man will be unable to properly separate the pure %0a> forces from the impure ones, and afterwards, utilize the pure forces to achieve %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 139 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the goal. This occurrence repeats itself until the appearance of the letter Bet, %0a> which represents the degree called "the Creator's blessing," against which there %0a> are no impure forces of any kind. %0a> %0a> And the Creator consented to create the world with the letter Bet, with its %0a> property; for it has no impure counterpart, only Bet presents an opportunity %0a> to carry out an analysis between good and evil, to determine when man works %0a> for himself and when he works for the Creator's sake. Therefore, only by its %0a> force, by its property can the world exist: so as to extract from the "mixture" %0a> of one's desires only what's pure, and elevate them above the impure, down to %0a> complete eradication of the latter, and the consequent attainment of complete %0a> correction of one's nature. %0a> %0a> As it follows from The Zohar, only the Creator's help, called "a blessing," is %0a> the force of man's salvation, the only thing capable of freeing him from the rule %0a> of the impure forces. And this force, called "blessing," descends only upon those %0a> that advance along the right path. %0a> %0a> The right path is a combination of three conditions: (i) one's efforts in %0a> idying (only!) genuine Kabbalistic sources; (ii) contact with a true Kabbalist, %0a> accepts as his teacher; and (iii) contact with like-minded people, who %0a> eek spiritual elevation. A more detailed explanation will be provided to serious %0a> students only. %0a> %0a> All twenty-two letters are divided into three degrees: Bina, Zeir Anpin (ZA), %0a> and Malchut, since there are no Kelim (letters) above Bina. Twenty-two letters in %0a> Bina are called "big," twenty-two letters in ZA are called "medium," and twenty- %0a> two letters in Malchut are called "small." %0a> %0a> Each of the three Sefirot of Bina, ZA, and Malchut are further divided into %0a> three degrees: The twenty-two letters of Bina contain their own Bina, ZA, and %0a> Malchut. Likewise, ZA has his own ten Sefirot, in which his Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a> also contain twenty-two letters. The same applies to Malchut. %0a> %0a> The twenty-two letters of each degree are divided into three types. The letters %0a> from Aleph to Tet (1-9) are considered units; these are the nine Sefirot of Bina. %0a> The letters from Yod to Tzadik (10-90) are considered tens; these are the nine %0a> Sefirot of ZA. And finally, the four letters Kuf, Reish, Shin and Tav (100-400) are %0a> considered hundreds; and these are the four Sefirot of Malchut, since Malchut is %0a> located below and downwards of Chazeh de ZA, which corresponds in height to %0a> the four Sefirot of ZA. %0a> %0a> Bina, units, big letters, nine letters: Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Hey, Vav, %0a> Zayin, Chet, Tet. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 140 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA, tens, medium letters, nine letters: Yod, Chaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Sarnech, %0a> Ayin, Peh, Tzadik. %0a> %0a> Malchut, hundreds, small letters, four letters: Kuf, Reish, Shin, Tav. %0a> %0a> However, it is known that units are in Malchut, tens are in ZA, and hundreds %0a> are in Bina, which contradicts the aforesaid that units are in Bina, tens are in %0a> ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. Such inverse dependence is caused by the %0a> inverse relationship between the Lights and the Kelim: the lowest Light enters %0a> the Highest Kelim. The Upper Kelim are the first to emerge, from Keter down to %0a> Malchut (Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut), whereas the first to enter them %0a> is the smallest Light, Ne/esh, followed by Ruach, Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida. %0a> %0a> Therefore, if there are only units in the Kelim, from Aleph to Tet, then only %0a> the Light of Ne/esh is present. And if tens are added to the Kelim, the Light of %0a> Ruach appears, and if hundreds are added to the Kelim, the Light of Neshama %0a> fills them. %0a> %0a> This is why hundreds are defined as Bina, tens as ZA, and units as Malchut. %0a> However, with regard to the Kelim, the order is inversed: units are in Bina, tens %0a> are in ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The letters descend from Bina to ZA and from there to Malchut. When they %0a> descend from Bina to ZA, they descend as three lines: 22/3 = 7 letters in each, with %0a> the remaining letter being added to the middle line. These twenty-two letters de- %0a> scend in three lines to Malchut, which consists of five final letters MANTZEPACH, %0a> thereby bringing the total number in Malchut to 22 + 5 = 27 letters. %0a> %0a> The middle line is called "Heaven," "firmament." Therefore, when The %0a> Zohar speaks of letters in the firmament, it means that the two middle lines, %0a> 7 + 7 = 14 = Yod + Dalet = Yad (hand) writes all the twenty-two letters in the %0a> firmament (ZA) through the middle line. That is how one should interpret the %0a> words of the Torah regarding the letters that appear in the sky or having seen the %0a> hand that writes the letters in the sky. %0a> %0a> The twenty-two letters of the Torah are the Kelim to be filled by the Light %0a> of NRN. Units— from Aleph to Yod— are the Kli intended for the Light of Bina %0a> (Neshama). Tens— from Yod to Kuf— are the Kli meant for the Light of ZA {Ruach). %0a> Hundreds— from Kuf to Tav— are the Kli for the Light of Malchut (Ne/esh). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina: Light (100) %0a> ZA: Light (10) %0a> Malchut: Light (1) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kelim (1) %0a> Kelim (10) %0a> Kelim (100) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 141 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Letters are the Kelim, into which the Light clothes; in all, there are twenty- %0a> two special properties, and thus twenty-two symbols of their description, %0a> called letters. Just as the combinations of the twenty-two letters suffice for the %0a> description of all existing knowledge, the various couplings, unions (Zivugim of %0a> Sefirot) of the twenty-two Kelim, properties, desires of the Partzuf are sufficient %0a> for receiving and bestowing Light, fulfilling all spiritual actions and bringing all %0a> the letters (man's desires) to correction. %0a> %0a> Letters represent the various correlations of ZON: %0a> %0a> a) ZA, consisting of six parts of his extremities, husband to Malchut, %0a> designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Yesod— level of an embryo; %0a> %0a> b) ZA designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Tifferet, consisting of six parts of %0a> his hands— level of nursing; %0a> %0a> c) ZA that stands between AVI, while Nukva must ascend to him, thereby %0a> reaching the level of reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> d) ZA, the letter Vav, above him are ten Sefirot Keter-Hochma, below him %0a> are ten Sefirot Bina-Tifferet-Malchut—and together they make up the %0a> letter Aleph. And the final corrected state will come when Malchut %0a> ascends to Keter of ZA (the Upper Yod in the letter Aleph) at the end %0a> of correction. When Malchut ascends above Parsa (Vav), she receives %0a> the Light herself, whereas when she descends below Vav, she receives %0a> from ZA. As Malchut ascends, she forms Taamim (tone marks), when %0a> she descends, she is called Nekuda (point), and when she merges with %0a> ZA, she is referred to as a point inside Vav (Shuruk). %0a> %0a> The order of ATBaSH: There is a special combination of letters, e.g. the %0a> first with the last ('A' through 'T'), the second with the second last ('B' through %0a> 'Sh'), etc., which designate the conditions for diffusion of the Upper Light from %0a> Above downwards. %0a> %0a> MANTZEPACH: All the worlds and Partzufim were created with the %0a> twenty-two letters of Malchut. The screen is located in the head of the Partzuf, %0a> preventing the Light from entering. It repels the Light, calculates how much it %0a> can receive for the Creator's sake, and only then accepts it. %0a> %0a> Each of the five levels of the will to receive that exist in Malchut, in the Guf %0a> of the Partzuf, has a corresponding restriction in the screen, located in the Peh, %0a> to prevent the Light from entering the body. Therefore, the screen in the Peh %0a> consists of five parts, forces. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 142 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> These five restrictive forces of the screen, five exertions of the screen are %0a> designated by the five final letters of the alphabet: Mem-Nun-Tzadik-Peh-Chaf %0a> (abbreviated as MANTZEPACH). They are called "final letters" because they %0a> are written only at the end of words. These forces determine the reception %0a> of Light in the body of the Partzuf, and therefore beget the other twenty-two %0a> letters (Kelim, corrected desires, which receive the Light). Although the five %0a> letters MANTZEPACH are only found at the end of words, in oral speech they %0a> represent the five groups of pronunciation of the twenty-two letters. And the %0a> letters MANTZEPACH stand at the head of each group. %0a> %0a> Out of the five letters MANTZEPACH originate five groups of sounds: %0a> %0a> 1. Peh-Keter: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the throat; they are %0a> called AChHA—Aleph-Chet-Hey-Ayin. Aleph is the Light of Partzuf Keter of Atzilut, %0a> concealed from the lower ones and called Atik. Chet is the Light of Partzuf Hochma %0a> of the world of Atzilut, called Arich Anpin and also concealed from the lower %0a> ones. Hey is the Light of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, called Ima (mother), %0a> who receives the Light of Hochma from Aba (father) in order to pass it on to her %0a> children (ZON). Ayin is the Light of Zeir Anpin 's face. Since the Light of ZA that %0a> enters Malchut is called "the Torah," it is said that the Torah has Ayin (70) faces, %0a> that the Creator (ZA) has Ayin (70) names. After all, with regard to Malchut, ZA is %0a> the Creator. Therefore, seventy souls descended to Egypt, and so forth. %0a> %0a> 2. Chaf-Hochma-. a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the palate; %0a> they are called GlChiK— Gimel-Yod-Chaf-Kuf. The letters AChHA transfer the %0a> Light to the letters GlChiK: Aleph passes the Light to Gimel, which carries reward %0a> (Gemul— Gimel) for the righteous. Chet passes the Light of Hochma to Yod, but this %0a> Light is concealed. Hey illuminates Chaf with the Light of Bina, which carries %0a> joy. Ayin illuminates Kuf. Just as Ayin = 70, as it consists of seven Sefirot, Hesed- %0a> Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, each containing ten Sefirot of its own, %0a> Kuf = 100, as it consists of ten Sefirot from Keter to Malchut, each consisting of %0a> its own ten. Hence, the palate fully complements the throat. %0a> %0a> 3. Nun-Bina: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the tongue, called %0a> DaTLaT— Dalet-Tet- Lamed- 'Nun-Tav. %0a> %0a> 4. Mem-ZA: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the lips, called %0a> BOMoCH-Bet-Vav-Mem-Cka/. %0a> %0a> 5. Tzadik-Malchut: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the teeth, %0a> called ZaSSHRaTZ - Zayin-Samech-Shin-Reish-Tzadik. %0a> %0a> Voice and speech: Voice is formed in ZA, speech— in Malchut. If he who %0a> is righteous, and who exists in the worlds BYA, raises his prayers (MAN) to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 143 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut of the world of Atzilut, he causes ZON to ascend to AVI, and unites %0a> them in a constant Zivug so as to assure the Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a> ZON receives the Light from AVI; this Light is called "voice" and "speech," %0a> and this is the power of the righteous— to create the pure and destroy the %0a> impure with their voice. %0a> %0a> Man's speech is conceived in the lungs: as the air exits the lungs and %0a> reaches the mouth, it turns to voice, and as it leaves the mouth, it becomes %0a> speech. Two lips accept the voice from the two parts of the lungs (the left and %0a> the right) and turn it into speech. Each lung consists of five parts so as to %0a> pass to the five parts in the mouth: to the guttural letters AChHA, the labial %0a> letters BOMoCH, the palatal letters GlChiK, the lingual letters DaTLaT and %0a> the dental letters ZaSSHRaTZ. %0a> %0a> The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a> names of ZA originate from the seventy (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is %0a> called "Heaven," and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also known %0a> as Ruach (because of the Light of Ruach in them), which ascends to Bina (ears), %0a> where it turns to sound, with Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER TAV %0a> %0a> Each of the twenty-two letters corresponds to a particular spiritual degree, on %0a> which it acts. The letter itself is that spiritual degree. Hence, the letter Tav claims %0a> that its properties are the most suitable for the creation of the world, that its %0a> properties can bring the world to correction and to the goal of creation, for it %0a> defines the property of "truth," the Creator's seal. %0a> %0a> The impure forces exist solely on account of the miniature Light received %0a> from the pure forces; this Light is called Ner Dakik (tiny candle). Without this %0a> Light, the impure forces would neither be able to exist nor to function— tempting %0a> man with the pleasures they received from the tiny spark of Light that fell from %0a> the pure Sefirot. Therefore, the last, lowest pure degree lets a little bit of the %0a> Upper Light down to the impure forces. %0a> %0a> Without the support of the pure forces, the impure forces would instantly %0a> disappear. A question arises: who needs them to exist and what for? Obviously, %0a> the impure forces were created on a par with pure ones by the Creator Himself, %0a> for there is no other power in the entire universe besides Him. %0a> %0a> It was necessary to create impure forces in order to concentrate them in %0a> the enormous desires to receive pleasure, in immense egoism. The system of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 144 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the impure worlds of ABYA serves as a kind of storehouse of desires to receive %0a> pleasure, from which, to the extent of his correction, man can take more and %0a> more new desires so as to correct them. Thus, by attaching uncorrected impure %0a> forces to himself and correcting them, man can gradually ascend higher and %0a> higher, up to the level of the Creator. For this purpose the Creator created %0a> impure forces and sustains them through the system of pure ones. %0a> %0a> The impure system of the worlds ABYA exists on the same level, parallel to %0a> the pure one. Our world is located under these two spiritual systems. Our world %0a> is also called egoistic and impure, but its forces and desires are so insignificant %0a> that they are located below the worlds of the impure ABYA. %0a> %0a> When, with the help of Kabbalah, one surmounts the level of our world's %0a> egoism, he enters the pure world of Assiya. And immediately after, the impure %0a> world of Assiya begins to influence him, tempting him with its false pleasures. %0a> By overcoming the temptations of the impure world of Assiya, one ascends %0a> spiritually. But until one surmounts the impure desires of his body, of our %0a> world, he will not begin to sense, or enter the spiritual worlds, for he would not %0a> be able to withstand the impure forces that act there. %0a> %0a> Unlike the forces that act in the spiritual world, man in our world is only %0a> influenced by the small egoistic force called his "body," his ego. Man can struggle %0a> with this force, either winning or losing his battles. But even if he is defeated, %0a> man retains that tiny spark of Light (Ner Dakik), which sustains his existence. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag gives the following example: man's work in this world %0a> resembles writing on a school blackboard, where any mistake may be wiped off %0a> lout harming the writer, where he can make corrections and write anew, %0a> le learns to write correctly. Only when he learns to write correctly is %0a> to enter the spiritual realm. %0a> %0a> Therefore, our world is the most insignificant of all. Everyone must begin %0a> here, and everyone is bound to return here, and be born again and again until %0a> he crosses the boundary between our world and the spiritual one. (There are %0a> many additional conditions required for the soul to not descend to this world %0a> anymore, and those who will merit, will understand). %0a> %0a> Hence, the vertical line, the leg of the letter Kuf, descends below the writing %0a> line, which signifies the Light descending through this letter down to the impure %0a> forces. And no other letter descends below the writing line, like the Kuf does. %0a> %0a> For the impure forces to exist (any creature, whether pure or impure, can %0a> only exist by receiving Light), the last, lowest degree of pure forces descends into %0a> the impure forces and gives them the Light necessary for their existence and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> s anew, %0a> ly is he %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 145 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> realization of their role: to entice man with their pleasures and convince him to %0a> act according to the law of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> At first, the left leg of the letter Tav also descended below the writing line. %0a> But the Creator saw that the impure forces would then be too closely connected %0a> to pure ones, so He severed this connection and returned the left leg of the %0a> letter Tav back to the writing line, to the level of the pure forces. %0a> %0a> As a result of this shortening, the left leg of the Tav doubled in thickness, %0a> as it folded in two, and no Light passes to the impure forces anymore. On the %0a> contrary, it even becomes the Creator's seal by holding the impure forces at bay %0a> and preventing them from stealing the Upper Light, for as soon as any impure %0a> forces touch it, they instantly die. %0a> %0a> And all the life-force necessary for the sustenance of the impure forces is %0a> passed by the Creator through the letter Kuf, because, being the first letter of %0a> Malchut, it is remote from them; thus, there is no fear or risk that its connection %0a> to the impure forces would become too strong. %0a> %0a> Malchut consists of only four letters from Above downwards: Kuf, Reish, %0a> Shin, and Tav. Kuf is the first, Tav is the last, and below it are the impure %0a> forces. Therefore, if they receive the Light they need according to the thought %0a> of creation from Kuf, the furthest letter from them, the impure forces have %0a> no way of "stealing" more Light than Malchut, who consists of four letters, is %0a> obliged to give them. %0a> %0a> This is why this letter is called Kuf, to show that it gives strength to the %0a> impure system of ABYA— a fake (nonexistent) man, just as a monkey (Kof in %0a> Hebrew) resembles a human being. %0a> %0a> And it misleads people by pretending to be the truth and claiming that its %0a> path leads to the attainment of spirituality, the Creator, Lishma, the sensation %0a> of the Creator. However, the pure forces maintain that only with the help of the %0a> Torah can man attain adequate correction of his properties so as to merge them %0a> with the Creator. %0a> %0a> And this is what the letter Tav claimed: because it is the Creator's seal of %0a> truth, it stands at the end of the pure system and does not allow the impure %0a> forces to cling to pure ones, and pose as if they are pure. This is why its %0a> properties are worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world— so %0a> that via the analysis of good and evil, purity and impurity, inhabitants of this %0a> world may be sure that by acquiring its properties they will achieve the goal %0a> of their creation. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 146 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The four letters Kuf-Reish-Shin-Tav make up the four Sefirot of Malchut of the %0a> world of Atzilut: Keter-Hochma-Bina-Tifferet, where Tifferet consists of six Sefirot— %0a> Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. But when the letter Kuf is by itself, without %0a> Reish-Shin-Tav, the Torah, which spreads to the worlds BYA, also shines upon the %0a> impure forces, and the angel of death receives the strength to destroy all that %0a> lives. This state is designated by the letter Kuf. But when Malchut is corrected, %0a> she is designated by the letter Hey, whose difference from Kuf lies in the long leg %0a> of the Kuf (Malchut de Malchut). %0a> %0a> This long left leg, which turns the Hey into Kuf, indicates that the Light %0a> descends from the pure forces (Partzufim) to the impure worlds of BYA, the %0a> impure forces referred to as death. And when Malchut joins with Bina and %0a> receives the strength from Bina to ascend and receive the Light, the other letters %0a> join Malchut, and she draws the Light of life from Bina. %0a> %0a> In this state, the left leg of the Kuf is reduced in half, turning the Kuf into %0a> Tav, whose left leg is twice as thick, due to its shortening. The part of Malchut %0a> that passed Light to the impure forces now ascended out of them, hence there %0a> are two kinds of Malchut: Miftacha (key)— the part that joined with Bina, and %0a> Man'ula (lock)— the part that ascended out of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> These two parts of Malchut manifest in different ways: Miftacha— openly and %0a> Man'ula— secretly. Two paths of bringing man to correction emerge from them: %0a> the good path of the Torah and the path of suffering. %0a> %0a> However, after Malchut corrects her properties and joins with Bina, she no %0a> longer parts from Bina, but, upon receiving Light from her, Malchut pours it %0a> onto the worlds, and the impure forces lose their strength to sow death and rule %0a> over the world. And if a case arises where a sinner must be punished, the impure %0a> forces must first receive permission to punish him, for without permission they %0a> may not reveal the Man'ula. %0a> %0a> Thus, after Malchut joins with Bina, thereby correcting her properties, the %0a> impure forces are no longer free to rule the world, unless they are permitted. %0a> The reason for this is the letter Tet, the last letter of Bina, which sends the Light %0a> of life to all with the help of the Miftacha. After Malchut joins with Bina, she %0a> becomes a Miftacha, and does not let go of this connection. Respectively, the %0a> impure forces, the leg of the letter Kuf, can no longer sow death. %0a> %0a> Three places emerge from this: (i) where only the properties of the letter %0a> Tet rule by shining with the Light of life of this world; (ii) the entire world after %0a> Malchut joins with Bina, defined as Miftacha, when the letter Tet shines upon %0a> all, but permits the punishment of sinners according to the rule: "You advance %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 147 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> towards the goal either by the path of the Torah or by the path of suffering"; (iii) %0a> hell, the place of eternal punishment by the letter Kuf, in contrast with the first %0a> place, ruled by the letter Tet, where life is eternally prosperous. %0a> %0a> All the letters with all their secret properties, described by those who %0a> understand them, are located in the Temple. All the Upper and lower worlds %0a> are created and function in the framework of their laws-properties, and the %0a> Supernal Name, the Creator's name HaVaYaH rules over all. %0a> %0a> The Mishkan (tabernacle) in the Temple was also designed with the help of %0a> letters, for its builder, Betzalel, knew how to join the letters that made Heaven %0a> and earth. And since he was unique in possessing this wisdom, he was entrusted %0a> with the building of the sanctuary. %0a> %0a> As the Creator chose Betzalel Above, so He wished him to be chosen below, %0a> as He said to Moshe Above: "Choose Betzalel." So Moshe said to his people %0a> below: "The Creator has chosen Betzalel." For such was Betzalel's name-property %0a> (Be Tzel El)— "In the Creator's shadow." %0a> %0a> The Creator is called ZA or the Sefira Tifferet in Partzuf ZA, which shines %0a> upon the Sefira Yesod, called Tzadik (righteous one). Betzalel is called Yesod, %0a> which receives the Light of VAK— an incomplete Light— from Tifferet, which is %0a> hence called "sitting in the shadow," and, in turn, shining into Malchut. Thus, %0a> like Tifferet, the Sefira Yesod that passes this Light also consists of six Sefirot: Hesed- %0a> Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. %0a> %0a> The name of the letter Tav, "truth," indicates that in order to reach its %0a> level, its degree, one must attain the property of truth. Therefore, the letter Tav %0a> claimed that with its properties man can fully analyze good and evil, renounce %0a> his impure desires as false, and to the degree that he renounces them, draw %0a> closer to the pure desires (forces), and thereby be certain that he will reach the %0a> goal of creation— correction of all his desires (Gmar Tikkun, end of correction). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ruly ask Him for help." For only with His help can one achieve correctior %0a> and spiritual elevation. However, this help only comes to those who genuinely, %0a> "truly" demand it. As soon as man is able to cry out wholeheartedly for the %0a> Creator's help, he instantly receives it. And if he does not receive an answer %0a> from the Creator— it is a sign that his request is not yet complete, that he did not %0a> yet fully realize his egoistic nature and properties as worthless, has not yet fully %0a> felt his helplessness and inability to exit and correct his properties by himself. %0a> This is why letter Tav was certain that once man acquires its property of truth, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 148 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> But the Creator answered her that it is not worthy of becoming the basis %0a> of creation, for the forces of judgment that would arise from it would be so %0a> strong that even the complete righteous, who fulfilled the entire Torah from %0a> Aleph to Tav (A to Z) and reached the property of truth, will nevertheless be %0a> punished by it, for they have not destroyed all the sinners, as it is written in %0a> the Talmud (Shabbat, 55). %0a> %0a> Furthermore, the Creator declines its request, for it is also the seal of %0a> death, as its power brought death to this world. For man is bound to die, as the %0a> serpent forged its seal and deceived Adam in his understanding of the Tree of %0a> Knowledge. This is why the world cannot exist with its properties. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER SHIN %0a> %0a> 24. The letter Shin appeared before the Creator and said: "Maker of the %0a> world, it befits the world to be created with me, for Your own name Shadday %0a> begins with me." The Creator replied: "You are fine, handsome, and truthful, %0a> but since the letters (properties) of the word Sheker (falsehood) took you to %0a> be with them, I cannot create the world with your properties, for SheKeR %0a> (falsehood) exists only because the letters Kuf and Reish took you." %0a> %0a> Malchut consists of ten Sefirot and has two endings: %0a> %0a> 1) If she has only her own properties, she contains all ten Sefirot, from %0a> Keter de Malchut to Malchut de Malchut. In this case she firmly restricts %0a> the diffusion of Light and is designated by the letter Tav; %0a> %0a> 2) If Ima-Bina of the world of At^ilut fills Malchut with her Light, Partzuf %0a> Malchut ends not in the Sefira Malchut, but in the Sefira Yesod, and is %0a> designated by the letter Shin. %0a> %0a> The three tips of the letter Shin are called its crown and signify the Light of %0a> Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), which descends from Partzuf Ima-Bina %0a> into Partzuf Malchut. This Light of Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), %0a> creates new altruistic properties in Malchut, altruistic intentions to receive the %0a> Light for the Creator's sake, after which Partzuf Malchut can receive the Ohr %0a> Hochma (Light of Wisdom) from ZA (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 22). When bonded %0a> so, ZA and Malchut are called "husband and wife," and the Light that Malchut %0a> receives from ZA is called 'TOO blessings." %0a> %0a> This new ending of Part^u/Malchut in the Sefira Yesod instead of in the Sefira %0a> Malchut is therefore called Yesod de Nukva or "the central point of existence," %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 149 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> for all that exists in the world originates from it and exists thanks to it. Partzuf %0a> Malchut is the sum of all the creatures, and we are all its parts. All the worlds %0a> and all that inhabit them constitute various parts of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a> world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> Each Upper Partzuf is considered the Creator of its adjacent lower Partzuf, %0a> for the latter originates (born) from it. Therefore, in relation to all the crea- %0a> tures, Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut is considered and called "the Creator," %0a> our Creator. %0a> %0a> And, like the Tav, the letter Shin is called "truth" and "the Creator's seal," %0a> for a seal signifies the end of a spiritual object— Partzuf, like a seal fixed at the %0a> end of a letter, written in the name of the Creator. The Creator's seal is similar %0a> to Himself; this is why the seal is called the mark of truth, for only the pres- %0a> ence of a seal gives a letter the force of truth, and confirms the truthfulness %0a> of its content. %0a> %0a> However, the significance of the letter Shin is greater than that of the letter %0a> Tav, for Shin is the first letter of the word Shadday, one of the Creator's names- %0a> properties, designating His power, by which He said "Dai" (enough) to creation- %0a> stop and do not descend further (Talmud, Hagigah, 12)— do not descend below %0a> the letter Shin. %0a> %0a> This reveals that the world and its inhabitants can only exist with the help %0a> of the letter Shin, thanks to its property that restricts the diffusion of Light. %0a> The Creator said: "Stop, Creature, at the letter Shin, and do not spread to the %0a> letter Tav," for if the Light had spread to Tav, the impure forces would have %0a> received such great strength that man would have no hope of escaping them and %0a> reaching altruistic properties. This is why the ending point of Shin is called "the %0a> central point of existence." %0a> %0a> Therefore, after the letter Shin saw the Creator refuse the letter Tav, precisely %0a> because ending the diffusion of Light with Tav creates conditions for correction %0a> of the world that are too difficult for man to meet, the letter Shin claimed that %0a> its property of Shadday is suitable for the creation of the world, and was certain %0a> that the Creator would choose it— its properties— as the basis of creation, for %0a> it possesses all the advantages that Tav lacked, which was the reason for the %0a> Creator's refusal. %0a> %0a> And it has Tav 's advantage, as well: it is the Creator's seal— truth. Moreover, %0a> it has an additional advantage: it is called by the name Shadday, the new ending %0a> of Malchut for the inhabitants of the world, instead of the ending by the property %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 150 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of the letter Tav. Based on all that, the letter Shin found the strength and courage %0a> to appear before the Creator with the proposition to create the world with it. %0a> %0a> But the Creator answered that precisely because of Shin's additional %0a> advantages compared to those of the letter Tav, the impure forces opposite it %0a> are strengthened. For opposite each letter (spiritually pure forces or properties) %0a> there is an opposing impure force (egoistic desire), as it is written: "The Creator %0a> had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a> %0a> The strengthening of the impure forces from the properties of the letter Shin %0a> occurred as a result of her properties joining the impure properties of falsehood, %0a> forging spiritual purity of the letters Kuf and Reish: falsehood would be unable %0a> to exist in the world, for it would be recognized at once, had the letters Kuf and %0a> Reish not put Shin at the head of the word SheKeR (falsehood). And when truth %0a> stands at the head of the word that designates the property of falsehood, man %0a> naturally tends to err. %0a> %0a> There are two sources of impure forces: the first is a small luminescence %0a> (Ner Dakik), which the pure force itself (the Creator) sends to the impure forces %0a> (desires) so as to sustain them. This is done so they would not disappear until %0a> there is a need to "punish" the sinners with them. However, these are small %0a> forces— their height is not great, for they receive only a small luminescence, %0a> sufficient to sustain their life. %0a> %0a> This small luminescence descends into the impure forces from the letter %0a> Kuf, which results in these impure forces becoming similar to man in the %0a> worlds BYA, as a monkey in comparison to a human being, as it is said: "The %0a> Creator had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a> %0a> The second source of impure forces arises from the lower ones' spiritual fall: %0a> as a result of people's evil, egoistic actions, the Light passes from the system of %0a> the pure forces into the impure. And the first transgression is Adam's sin, by %0a> which the system of the impure forces assumed an identical formation to that of %0a> the pure system, stationing itself opposite, parallel to it. As a result, the impure %0a> worlds ABYA emerged opposite the pure ones. %0a> %0a> The second source of impure forces is the letter Reish, which indicates that %0a> the impure forces rise and attach themselves to the pure forces, right up to the %0a> level of Bina of Malchut, designated by the letter Dalet. %0a> %0a> As was previously stated, the twenty-two letters of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a> world of Atzilut are divided in three groups of letters: units in Bina, tens in ZA, %0a> and hundreds in Malchut. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 151 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> PARTZUF %0a> %0a> %0a> SEFIROT %0a> %0a> %0a> LETTERS %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Aleph-Tet %0a> %0a> %0a> BIN A (IMA) %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Yod-Tzadik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Kuf-Tav %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Aleph-Tet %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Yod-Tzadik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Kuf-Tav %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Aleph-Tet %0a> %0a> %0a> MALCHUT %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Yod-Tzadik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Kuf-Tav %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The letters Alepk-Bet-Gimel correspond to Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina, called %0a> "the head" of a spiritual object (Partzuf). The letters from Dalet to Tet refer to the %0a> body of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Aleph %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bet %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> HEAD %0a> %0a> %0a> Gimel %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Dalet %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Hesed %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hey %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Gevura %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Vav %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Tifferet %0a> %0a> %0a> BODY %0a> %0a> %0a> Zayin %0a> %0a> %0a> Netzah %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Chet %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Hod %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Tet %0a> %0a> %0a> ■ Yesod %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The body only receives what descends to it from the head. Therefore, Dalet, %0a> the first letter of the body, through which the body receives Light from the head, %0a> is called Dalah ve Aniyah (poor and destitute). Dalet only receives what Gimel gives %0a> it. Since Gimel contains the Light of Hassadim, that is, what descends into Dalet. %0a> %0a> And this is why the letter Gimel is called Gomel Hassadim (merciful One) %0a> (Talmud, Shabbat, 104), according to its action with regard to Dalet, which would %0a> otherwise be completely without Light. The protruding sharp angle on the right %0a> side of Dalet is the sign of Dalet's abundance of Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 152 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> However, opposite the pure (altruistic) Malchut, stands the impure Malchut, %0a> who is pride and does not wish to receive the Light from Gimel and rely on it. %0a> Instead, she rises up in the desire to be the head, and in so creates the sharp %0a> angle of the Dalet. That indicates that the presence of Ohr Hassadim disappears, %0a> transforming it into the letter Reish, which is written as it is pronounced— with %0a> two letters: Reish and Shin. %0a> %0a> The true merging of the pure ZA and Malchut is called ECHaD (one), %0a> consists of the letters Aleph, Chet and Dalet, for the letters from Aleph to Chet %0a> are the nine Sefirot of ZA. He passes the Light from Gimel of Bina to Gimel of %0a> Malchut, resulting in Malchut being filled with the Light of Hassadim, thereby %0a> becoming Dalet with a protruding right angle. As a result of this, ZA and %0a> Malchut become one. %0a> %0a> When the lower ones (people) sin in their actions (intentions), they give %0a> the impure Malchut the strength to cling to the pure one— Dalet, to erase the %0a> sharp angle of the Light of Hassadim and turn it into the letter Reish. Thus, %0a> the word Echad (one) becomes Acher (other, alien, foreign): Ale£>h-Chet-Dalet of %0a> the word Echad are transformed into Aleph-Chet-Reish of the word Acher, for %0a> instead of the connection with the Creator emerges a connection with other, %0a> impure forces, called "Elokim Acherim" (other gods), which cling to ZA and %0a> Malchut of the pure world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> This leads to the letters Kuf and Reish distorting the Creator's seal (Shin), %0a> the letter of truth. As a result, Yesod of Malchut, which receives from Yesod de ZA, %0a> becomes linked to the impure source instead of the pure, for a new Yesod of the %0a> impure Malchut was formed with the help of the letter Shin. %0a> %0a> From here the impure forces develop up to ten Sefirot with a head and a %0a> body, whereas Shin becomes the source of all that desolates, for destruction of %0a> purity begets impurity. And from this emerged the system of the impure worlds %0a> ABYA of the impure man. %0a> %0a> Thus, we have learned how the letters Kuf and Reish became the two %0a> sources of emergence and development of impure forces. And since the impure %0a> forces pose as pure, they are called false, counterfeit letters whose purpose is to %0a> annihilate the system of the pure forces and their unity with the Creator, so as %0a> to forge themselves out of the devastation of the pure forces. %0a> %0a> The birth of the impure forces from the destruction of the pure ones %0a> is possible on account of the letter Shin, Yesod of Malchut, joining with the %0a> impure forces as a result of the forging of the letter Reish out of Dalet. Thereby, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 153 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Echad turns into Acher, and the system of the impure forces (Elokim Acherim, %0a> other gods) is created. %0a> %0a> And had the letters Kuf and Reish not captured the letter Shin, such an %0a> enormous system of impure forces, so capable of lying and falsifying everything %0a> in the eyes of man, would not have come into being. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Creator answered the letter Shin: "Though you are good, you %0a> will stand at the head of the word Sheker (falsehood) together with the letters %0a> Kuf and Reish. Indeed, upon capturing you, with your power they will be able %0a> to create an entire system of impure forces of falsehood and forgery. Hence, I %0a> cannot create the world with your properties, for since there is an impure system %0a> opposite from you, it is impossible to achieve the goal of creation with you." %0a> %0a> THE LETTERS KUF AND REISH %0a> %0a> 25. From the aforesaid, it follows that whoever wishes to tell a lie will succeed %0a> if he first tells the truth as a base on which the lie will then grow and start %0a> to act. And this is because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, in which the %0a> Patriarchs had been united, for the three lines in the writing of the letter %0a> Shin (w) signify the three Patriarchs, who designate the Sefirot-properties %0a> Hesed-Qevura-Tifferet. %0a> %0a> The letters Kuf and Reish indicate the evil side, as they form the impure %0a> side, called KaR (cold), which lacks warmth and life, for it draws its sustenance %0a> from Malchut when she turns from living water into ice. However, to create an %0a> opportunity to exist, these letters attach the Shin to themselves, thus creating the %0a> combination KeSHeR (tie, knot), which embodies strength and survival. %0a> %0a> For the Light of Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet of Bina, which she receives from Yesod %0a> de ZA, creates a new ending in Malchut, a new Kli-desire to receive the Light %0a> called "100 blessings" from ZA. And since Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet are called the %0a> Patriarchs, and the Light that passes to Malchut descends from them, the letter %0a> Shin that designates them is called "truth." %0a> %0a> By eliminating the sharp angle of the letter Dalet, the impure forces turn it %0a> into the letter Reish. By this, they convert the word ECHaD into ACHeR, thereby %0a> stealing Yesod of the pure Malchut, designated by Shin. Also, with the letter Shin %0a> they build the Yesod of the impure Malchut, which leads to a very strong clinging %0a> of impure forces to pure ones. This clinging is called KeSHeR, the reciprocal tie %0a> joining pure and impure forces, a knot that is not easily severed. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 154 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> From the aforesaid, we see that the reason for the letters wishing for the world %0a> to be created with them is that each of them believes that only its properties can %0a> correct the world. The letter Shin thinks that the Light of Hassadim will bring the %0a> souls to the goal of creation. However, the letters Kuf and Reish—KaR (cold)— do %0a> not desire this Light, for receiving the Light of Mercy for the sake of bestowal is %0a> pure, but receiving it for the sake of pleasure is impure. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER TZADIK %0a> %0a> 26. Subsequently, the letter Tzadik appeared before the Creator and said: %0a> "Master of the world, You should create the world with me, for Tzadikim (the %0a> righteous) are marked by me. You, who is called a Tzadik (righteous one), are %0a> also recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. %0a> Therefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by." %0a> %0a> The Creator answered: "Tzadik, you are truly righteous, but you must %0a> remain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world %0a> to be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse." The concealment %0a> of the letter Tzadik is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was %0a> then joined by the letter Yod from the Creator's Holy Name Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey %0a> (HaVaYaH), who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator %0a> and His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, %0a> thereby creating the letter Tzadik. %0a> %0a> The reason for the necessity of concealing the letter Tzadik, which makes it %0a> unsuitable for the creation of the world with it, is that when the Creator created %0a> Adam, i.e., ZA, He created him as two Part?u/im-objects— male and female, %0a> connected to each other back to back. This is why the letter Yod stands with its %0a> back to the back of the letter Nun, both facing opposite directions, just as the %0a> letter Tzadik is depicted: the face of Yod turned upwards, while the face of Nun %0a> is turned downwards. %0a> %0a> And the Creator also said to Tzadik: "In the future I will revoke the %0a> relationship of back-to back, and will join them face-to-face. In another place shall %0a> you so rise as such, but not at the beginning of creation. For in the beginning of %0a> creation, you must be connected back-to-back by the letters Nun and Yod, for this %0a> form indicates that the Light in you is concealed. Therefore, the world cannot %0a> be created with you." The letter Tzadik then left. %0a> %0a> Tzadik came to suggest that the world should be created with its properties, %0a> for when it saw that the Tav's request was turned down by the Creator due to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 155 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> its heavy laws, and the letter Shin— due to the impure forces clinging to it— it %0a> thought that its properties could be suitable for the creation of the world. After %0a> all, it, too, contains the Creator's seal, and no impure forces cling to it. %0a> %0a> That is why Tzadik said to the Creator that the righteous are sealed by %0a> its name as a mark of their union with Him, by circumcision and turning %0a> up of the place of contact (Zivug) with the Creator, which, thanks to these %0a> corrections, repels all the impure forces. %0a> %0a> The Creator, called Bina, is also marked by Tzadik, for He is righteous %0a> like ZA, since the Upper Part of Bina of the world of Atzilut (Aba ve Ima— AVI) %0a> corresponds to the male and female parts, like ZA and Malchut. And AVI are %0a> forever joined so as to send down the Light of Mercy and thus sustain the %0a> existence of all that are below them. This is why Tzadik thought itself suitable %0a> for creating the world, for the world lives by the Light of Mercy, and can reach %0a> the goal with its help. %0a> %0a> The letter Tzadik is called the Sefira Yesod of ZA. When Yesod joins with %0a> Malchut, it is defined as Tzadik (righteous), for the nine Sefirot of ZA are from Yod %0a> to Tzadik, and Kuf is the beginning of Malchut, which consists of four Sefirot— %0a> Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav. %0a> %0a> When Malchut is joined with Yesod of ZA, Kuf is joined with Tzadik, and %0a> Yesod is called Tzadik (righteous). And to this the Creator replied to Tzadik that %0a> it is Tzadik in Yesod of ZA: "And you are Tzadik in Me, for AVI are forever joined %0a> so as to pour down the Light of Mercy and sustain the existence of the lower %0a> ones. And you are righteous, for Malchut is also connected to you, just as in the %0a> alphabet, Kuf follows Tzadik. Yet, in spite of all that, you do not merit for your %0a> properties to become the basis of the world." %0a> %0a> Yesod of ZA includes in itself Malchut in the form of the letter Kuf in the %0a> word TzadiK. And when Malchut is included in Yesod as Tzadik, it is designated %0a> by the letter Nun, for Nun is Gevura of ZA (Yod-Keter, Chaf-Hochma, Lamed-Bina, %0a> Mem-Hesed, Nun-Gevura). %0a> %0a> When ZA grows and becomes big, his Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet become %0a> Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat. Thus, Gevura becomes Bina. And when ZA becomes %0a> small once again, Bina, too, returns to being Gevura (Nun). This fall is designated %0a> by Nun's head looking down. %0a> %0a> The letter Tzadik consists of the letters Nun and Yod connected back-to-back. %0a> The letter Nun designates Malchut with the properties of the Sefira Yesod included in %0a> her; Yod designates the actual Yesod of ZA. Their connection— back-to-back, facing %0a> out in opposite directions— indicates that impure forces cling to their backs. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 156 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> They conceal their backs from strangers since there is a flaw in their backs— the %0a> desire to receive the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma). This flaw must be concealed %0a> so as to prevent the impure forces from clinging to their backs. Therefore, the %0a> letter Tzadik is unsuitable for the world to be created by its properties. Its very %0a> shape reveals an opportunity for the impure forces to cling to it; this is why Adam %0a> (created out of ZA and Malchut when they are joined as Tzadik) is also created %0a> consisting of two halves, male and female, joined at their backs. %0a> %0a> And if the letter Tzadik were to argue that in the big state, in the presence %0a> of Ohr Hochma, ZA and Malchut unite face-to-face, it would be told that such %0a> connection is impossible at their place, but only during their ascent to AVI. For %0a> if such a connection were possible in their own place, the impure forces would %0a> immediately cling to them. For this reason, the letter Tzadik is unworthy of %0a> becoming the basis of the universe. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER PEH %0a> %0a> 27. The letter Peh entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a> to create the world with me, for the future liberation of the world is inscribed %0a> in me, as the word Pedut (liberation, redemption) begins with me. That is, %0a> liberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create %0a> the world with me." %0a> %0a> The Creator answered her: "Though you are fine, the word Peshah %0a> (transgression) begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent %0a> that strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding %0a> from others' eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the %0a> letter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it." And the Creator also said to the %0a> letter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, %0a> for within it is the property of Avon (crime, sin). And though Ayin tried to %0a> object, saying that its properties are contained in the word Anavah (humility), %0a> the Creator refused it nonetheless. %0a> %0a> Pedut (Liberation) begins with the letter Peh, meaning that the property %0a> of Peh is contained in future liberation. This is why the letter Peh claims that %0a> it is worthy of being the basis of the world. Indeed, both Galut (exile) and %0a> Ge'ula (redemption) depend on Malchut: when Malchut has no inner Light %0a> of Hochma, the people of Israel are exiled from the land of Israel. For in our %0a> world, the land of Israel corresponds to Malchut of the world of Atzilut, the %0a> spiritual land of Israel. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 157 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Just as in the spiritual world, ZA (Israel) distances from Malchut (the land %0a> of Israel), the people of Israel separate and leave their land in our world. And %0a> when the children of Israel correct their actions, they cause ZA (Israel) to fill his %0a> Malchut (the land of Israel) with Light, build her with his Light and unite with %0a> her face-to-face. As a result, the children of Israel of our world merit redemption %0a> and return to their land. %0a> %0a> The Light from ZA, which builds and fills Malchut, descends from Sefirot %0a> Net^ah and Hod in ZA. Hochma of Malchut clothes in Net^ah and Bina of Malchut %0a> clothes in Hod. The letters Ayin and Peh are Netzah and Hod in ZA. This is why %0a> Peh, the Sefira Hod in ZA, claimed that it was suitable to be the basis of the world, %0a> for the Light of Hochma that brings redemption to the entire world stems from %0a> Peh to Malchut. Thus, if the world achieved its property, it would undoubtedly %0a> reach the end of correction— complete redemption. %0a> %0a> The letter Peh thought that it was more suitable to become the basis of %0a> the world than Ayin because although Ohr Hochma enters Netzah-Ayin and Hod- %0a> Peh, and is mainly present in Netzah-Ayin, redemption depends on Hod-Peh, %0a> nonetheless. That is because initially, Bina liberates Malchut from her restrictions %0a> and thereby redeems her. %0a> %0a> By receiving from Bina her properties of mercy, Malchut merits redemption. %0a> This is fulfilled in the following way: Bina transcends her own properties and %0a> joins with Malchut, as a result of which, upon receiving the Light of Hassadim, %0a> Malchut can now receive the Light of Hochma. The restrictions imposed on the %0a> reception of Light mostly affect the left side, i.e., Hod-Peh in ZA. And that is why %0a> the letter Peh thought that since the Light of Bina enters it, and not Netzah-Ayin, %0a> it is better suited to become the basis of the world. %0a> %0a> However, all the individual corrections made during the 6,000 years of the %0a> world's existence until the end of correction are considered incomplete, for the %0a> Upper Light, which allows for the discovery and analysis of all the impure forces %0a> within oneself, is not present in its entirety. Therefore, the Light may not be %0a> received in the worlds of BYA, below Parsa, below the boundary that separates %0a> the world of At^ilut from the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> Parsa is Malchut that ascended to Bina in order to restrict the diffusion and %0a> reception of Light into those parts of her that are located below Bina. And as %0a> a consequence of Adam's attempt to nevertheless receive the Light under the %0a> Parsa, impurity slipped into Malchut, of which it is said that the serpent appeared %0a> before Chava (Eve) and brought impurity upon her (Talmud, Shahhat, 146). This %0a> impurity will only be corrected at the end of correction. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 158 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The thing is that the absence of the Upper Light in the force capable of %0a> discerning good from evil in all of Malchut's thickness gives rise to a flaw called %0a> "tears"— two tears that fall into a vast sea from the two eyes of Hochma and Bina %0a> that are concealed from all. %0a> %0a> The two eyes are Hochma and Bina, and the tears signify the flaw in them %0a> from the presence of the impure force that appeared in them as a result of %0a> Adam's sin. This led to the ruin of the two Temples. These tears in Malchut's %0a> eyes will only dry at the end of correction, when death disappears from the %0a> world and all the Light shines in Hochma and Bina (item 56). %0a> %0a> So the letter Peh was told that although it brings the world Pedut (redemption) %0a> with its Light, and although all redemptions pass only through it, this Light is %0a> incomplete. All the individual corrections are imperfect, for they come and go, %0a> just as the two Temples. %0a> %0a> For the properties of Peshah (transgression) and Pedut (redemption) in the %0a> letter Peh are not sufficiently perfect and complete so as to withstand the sin of %0a> Adam, for in the absence of the full Light of Hochma, there is clinging of impure %0a> forces. Hence, the letter Peh is unworthy of being the basis of the world. %0a> %0a> And since the property of Peshah (transgression) is concealed, the force of %0a> the serpent is present therein, deceiving people and leading them to their death. %0a> And it is impossible to kill it, just as a snake bites and immediately hides its head %0a> in itself (similar to the head of the letter Peh), which makes it impossible to kill %0a> it, for one may only kill the serpent within oneself by striking the "head." This %0a> is why the letter Peh is unsuitable for the creation of the world. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER AYIN %0a> %0a> Bina of the world of Atzilut is called Ima Ilaa (Supernal Mother) and also Anavah %0a> (modesty, humility). (Here, the capital "A" designates the letter Ayin, not to be %0a> confused with Aleph). The Sefira Netzah of Zeir Anpin (designated by the letter %0a> Ayin) clothes into Malchut with all of its Light, and ascends to Bina, who adorns %0a> her with her own adornments: Bina clothes into Netzah of ZA. But since the %0a> letter Peh, signifying Peshah (transgression) is concealed in ~Netzah, the Creator %0a> refused to create the world with its properties, as it is written in item 27. %0a> %0a> Two words render the meaning of the word "transgression" in Hebrew: %0a> Peshah and Avon. However, "transgression" is mainly concentrated in the letter %0a> Peh, for Malchut of ZA connects into the Sefira Hod of ZA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 159 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As a result of Adam's sin, Klipot (shells, impure forces) cling to Malchut of %0a> ZA. But Netrah of ZA is a property of ZA himself, and impure forces cannot %0a> cling to it. Yet, as it is written in the Talmud (Baba Kama), even Netrah is subject %0a> to Klipot clinging to it. %0a> %0a> This flaw— the ability of the impure forces to cling to Netrah of ZA— is called %0a> "transgression." However, the word Avon (not Peshah) indicates that Netrah is %0a> pure and direct, and that the transgression is caused by its connection with %0a> the Se/ira Hod. %0a> %0a> The reason the Creator turns to the letters Peh and Ayin at the same time %0a> is that Netrah and Hod are like two body parts— two legs. This is why they both %0a> appeared before Him with their requests. However, The Zohar clarifies each of %0a> them (their properties) one at a time. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER SAMECH %0a> %0a> 28. The letter Samech appeared before the Creator and said: "Creator of the %0a> world, it would be good to create the world with my properties, for within %0a> me is Smicha (support) for the fallen, as it is written: 'The Creator supports %0a> (Somech) all who fall.'" The Creator replied: "That is why you are needed in %0a> your place; do not move from it. If you move from your place, contained in %0a> the word Somech, those who fall will lose your support, for they rely on you %0a> (your properties)." Having heard this, the letter Samech departed. %0a> %0a> The letter Samech stands for Se/ira Tifferet in ZA, i.e., Bina in the body of %0a> ZA. Since Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina (KHB) were transformed into Hesed-Gevura- %0a> Tifferet (HGT) in ZA, they were emptied of the Light of Hochma, and were left %0a> with only the Light of Hassadim, thus changing their name from KHB to HGT. %0a> %0a> As we know, Bina consists of two parts: the Upper Part, called GAR: Gimel %0a> (three) Rishonot (first ones)— the first three Sefirot KHB, and the lower part, called %0a> ZAT: Zayin (seven) Tachtonot (lower ones)— the seven lower Sefirot from Hesed to %0a> Malchut. The Upper Part of Bina is called Aba ve Ima (AVI). Being filled with the %0a> Light of Mercy, Aba ve Ima exist in a state of perfection— without any desire to %0a> receive, but only to bestow. %0a> %0a> AVI are designated by Samech (numerical value - 60), for they include the %0a> first three Sefirot KHB and three Sefirot of ZA, which, in view of the absence of %0a> Ohr Hochma in ZA, are not called KHB, but rather HGT. Therefore AVI consist %0a> of six Sefirot, each consisting of ten, totaling 60 = Samech. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 160 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZAT of Bina receive the Light from Above and pass it on to ZA. This part %0a> of Bina has the property of ZA, rather than of Bina, as it needs to receive exactly %0a> what ZA needs, and then pass it to him. Since, unlike Bina, who does not wish %0a> to receive anything, ZAT of Bina need to receive Ohr Hochma for ZA, they feels %0a> a lack for it, and thus separate from Bina and an independently existing object- %0a> Partzuf forms out of her lower part. %0a> %0a> This Partzuf is called YESHSUT, and it is designated by the letter Mem %0a> (numerical value - 40), for it consists of four Sefirot—Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod %0a> of Partzuf AVI. Owing to its shape (properties), the block-letter Mem is called %0a> Mem Stumah (closed). %0a> %0a> However, this separation of AVI into two parts occurs only when they have %0a> no Light of Hochma, but only the Light of Hassadim. Consequently, the Upper %0a> Part of Bina remains in its perfection, whereas the lower part feels a flaw in its %0a> state by not receiving Ohr Hochma. And since spiritual objects are separated by %0a> the differences in their properties, the sensation of imperfection separates the %0a> lower part of Bina from the Upper. %0a> %0a> However, if those below improve their "intentions" (called "actions" in %0a> the spiritual), and ask ZA for help in correcting their actions, overcoming the %0a> egoism of impure desires, and acquiring spiritually pure, altruistic desires, ZA %0a> then turns to the superior YESHSUT, which turns to AVI. AVI then send their %0a> request even higher, receive the Light of Hochma and pass it to YESHSUT. %0a> %0a> Finally, YESHSUT and AVI unite into one Partzuf, for having received Ohr %0a> Hochma, YESHSUT becomes as perfect as AVI are perfect being filled with Ohr %0a> Hassadim. YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma down to ZA, who then passes %0a> it to Malchut. The Light that Malchut receives from ZA is referred to as 100 %0a> blessings, for Samech = 60 joins with Mem = 40. %0a> %0a> However, when man sins in his intentions (desires, actions), he does not %0a> turn to Malchut with a request for help, causing the Light of Hochma to disappear %0a> from ZA, and ZA returns from Gadlut (big state) back to Katnut (small state). %0a> (When ZA contains the Light of Hochma, he is called "big"; and when he is filled %0a> with only the Light of Hassadim, he is called "small"). And the united Partzuf %0a> Bina is once more divided into AVI and YESHSUT. %0a> %0a> In this small state (Katnut), ZA and Malchut are in danger of impure forces %0a> (Klipot) clinging to them. To make certain this does not happen, for then they %0a> may fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa into the worlds BYA, AVI send %0a> them the property of Samech (the Light of Mercy). And although it is only the %0a> Light of Hassadim without the Light of Wisdom (Light of Hochma), it provides %0a> ZA and Malchut with the sensation of perfection in acts of bestowal, and thus %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 161 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> impure forces can no longer cling to them, for the sole intention of the impure %0a> forces is to receive the Light of Wisdom from a pure Partzuf. %0a> %0a> And this is why the Light that fills ZA in Katnut is called Samech, which %0a> testifies to its action: Samech "supports" ZA and Malchut so that they wouldn't %0a> fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa. %0a> %0a> That is why the letter Samech thought that if the world were created with %0a> its properties, it would be able to reach the goal of creation and merge with %0a> the Creator. Its Light could shine in ZA and Malchut even in their small state, %0a> and the Klipa (impure force) would not attempt to snatch the Light from them. %0a> On the contrary, the impure, egoistic forces would flee from its Light. Samech %0a> believed that if the world were to be created with its properties, it would be able %0a> to protect all creatures, even when their actions were corrupted, for even in such %0a> a state, the impure force would not be able to harm them. %0a> %0a> But the Creator said to Samech that precisely because its role is to support %0a> those who fall and to protect the lower ones in times of their spiritual descent, %0a> it must stay in its place and not move from it. For if the world were created by %0a> it, its power would always prevail over all, ridding ZA and Malchut of the chance %0a> to grow out of their small state. %0a> %0a> And if ZA and Malchut don't stimulate the lower ones (people) to raise %0a> MAN— request for help in achieving Gadlut, the Upper Light will not be able %0a> to descend to bring the creatures to the end of correction and redemption. %0a> Therefore, the letter Samech must support the lower ones until they merit more. %0a> But when they do merit, they will be able to receive the great Light called " 100 %0a> blessings" into their entire Partzuf. So the Creator refused to create the world %0a> with the letter Samech. %0a> %0a> "Because the lower ones need Samech only in their Katnut, in the absence %0a> of the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), ZON need you and you can help them. %0a> However, they need you only in their Katnut. But you do not help to bring them %0a> to perfection, and so you cannot be the basis of the world." %0a> %0a> THE LETTER NUN %0a> %0a> 29. The letter Nun entered and said to the Creator: "It would be good for You %0a> to create the world with me, for Norah Tehilot (great praises) is written with %0a> me, as well as 'Praising of the righteous.'" %0a> %0a> The Creator replied: "Return to your place, for you are the reason that %0a> the letter Samech returned to its place. And rely on it for support. For the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 162 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> letter Nun exists in the word Nefilah (fall), which must be corrected by the %0a> letter Samech. This is the reason why it needed to return to its place— so as to %0a> strengthen the lower ones." The letter Nun left Him at once. %0a> %0a> When Nun saw that the Creator sent the letter Samech away (as its properties %0a> are only used in the state of Katnut, that is, only to support those who had fallen %0a> from the Gadlut), it thought that it was worthy of being the basis of the world. %0a> This is because not only does Nun have all the advantages of Samech, but it can %0a> also use Ohr Hochma, the Light of Gadlut. Thus, the reason for the Creator's %0a> refusal to Samech does not apply to Nun. %0a> %0a> The Sefira Gevura in ZA is called Nun, for it is entirely mitigated by Bina's %0a> property of mercy, called Nun = 50 gates of Bina. It is this property of Gevura that %0a> gives ZA the name Norah Tehilot (great praises). lma-Bina is called Tehilah (praise), %0a> and since Gevura descends from Bina, it is referred to as Norah Tehilot, while Nun %0a> is used in the Sefira Yesod, in the Gadlut of ZA during his Zivug with Nukva. Like %0a> Ima, this is whence Nukva receives the name Tehilah, while ZA becomes one in %0a> both Tehilot— Ima and Nulcva. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the letter Nun said that, being in Gevura, the left line of ZA, it %0a> attracts the Light of Mercy emanated by Samech (Bina, Ima), which is also called %0a> the "Upper Tehilah," as a result of which ZA acquires its properties and the name %0a> Norah Tehilot to match them. This is why Nun has all the properties of Samech: the %0a> Light of Mercy that bestows perfection and repels the impure forces-desires. %0a> %0a> The letter Nun added: "However, I have an additional advantage in that I am %0a> used during the big state of ZA in his Yesod, in the letter Tzadik, of which I am %0a> the left element." This Nun in the letter Tzadik is that same Nun that is defined as %0a> Norah Tehilot (praises of the righteous), for even when ZA achieves Gadlut during %0a> the ascent of ZON to AVI, Nun also acts in Yesod of ZA, connecting Nukva back- %0a> to-back with ZA, so that ZA receives the Light of Mercy from AVI (Samech). %0a> %0a> And so Nun is called "praises of the righteous," for Yod (righteous one, the %0a> basis of the world) mounts it. Nun is called "great praises," for it attracts the %0a> Light of Wisdom to Malchut in the state of Gadlut. %0a> %0a> Therefore, we find that Malchut receives all her beauty from Nun, which is %0a> located in Yesod of ZA. This is why the letter Nun claimed that it merits for the %0a> world to be created with its properties, for its luminescence adds to the Light of %0a> Wisdom that unites and revives ZON, and does not merely support them, like %0a> the letter Samech. %0a> %0a> So the Creator answered it: "You are wrong in thinking that you merit %0a> leading the world to complete correction by your properties, without the clinging %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 163 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of impure forces, for even your properties need to be supported by the letter %0a> Samech. Indeed, this is precisely why you are connected back-to-back with the %0a> letter Yod, and the Light of Samech guards you against the clinging of the impure %0a> forces onto you. And that is why your properties, which rely upon the strength %0a> of Samech, are merely ones of support. Hence, you are unworthy of becoming %0a> the basis of the world." %0a> %0a> THE LETTERS MEM AND LAMED %0a> %0a> 30. The letter Mem entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a> for You to create the world by me, for MelecH (King) is called by me." The %0a> Creator replied: "That is so, but I shall not create the world by you, for the %0a> world needs a King. Return to your place. Also, I shall not create the world %0a> with the letters Lamed and Chaf that form the word MeLeCH (King), as the %0a> world cannot exist without a King." %0a> %0a> The letter Mem is the Se/ira Hesed in ZA, which receives the Light from its %0a> corresponding Se/ira Hesed in Bina. When, in addition to the Light of Mercy %0a> in his small state, ZA receives the Light of Wisdom and becomes big, his Sefirot %0a> HGT turn into Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat (HBD). In other words, Hesed in ZA %0a> ascends and becomes Hochma, thereby revealing a new Light, the Light of %0a> Hochma, the Light of the Creator's face. %0a> %0a> This is why the letter Mem claimed that it was suitable for the world to be %0a> created by it, for it reveals the Creator's Light to the world, thereby eliminat- %0a> ing any risk of impure forces clinging to it, and so the world is guaranteed %0a> complete correction. %0a> %0a> But the Creator answered that it is forbidden to reveal this Light to the %0a> world, for the world needs for this great Light to first clothe itself in the three %0a> letters of the word MeLeCH. In other words, the great Light may be revealed in %0a> the world only if Mem joins with the letters Lamed and Chaf. So the Creator said, %0a> "Go and join with them." %0a> %0a> Mem in the word Meleck is Hesed. Lamed is Bina, which passes the Light %0a> to ZA. The letter Chaf is Malchut, Nukva of ZA, for there cannot be a Meleck %0a> (King) without Malchut (Kingdom). Also, all of the Light becomes revealed only %0a> thanks to Malchut. %0a> %0a> In this case, Malchut shines from ZA in three places: %0a> %0a> 1) Malckut becomes a Kisseh (throne) for a King (ZA). A Kisseh derives from %0a> Kissui (cover, concealment), so it is designated by the bent letter Chaf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 164 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 2) Malchut clothes ZA. Because the great Light is revealed only to Israel, %0a> Malchut clothes ZA, and when her kingdom is revealed, ZA frees %0a> himself from her garment and throws it over all the nations of the %0a> world, idolaters, and the Light of his face pours upon Israel. And all %0a> the righteous then point their finger at the Creator and say: "This is %0a> the Creator, to whom I aspired!" This diffusion of Light is designated %0a> by the letter Chaf. %0a> %0a> 3) Malchut becomes a crown on the head of ZA. And this is the property %0a> of the letter Chaf, of Keter (crown of ZA). %0a> %0a> THE LETTER CHAF %0a> %0a> 31. At this time the letter Chaf descended from the Kisseh - the Creator's %0a> throne, and stood before the Creator. It trembled and said to Him: "Creator %0a> of the world, with my properties I merit to become the basis of the world, for I %0a> am Kavod - Your Glory." When the letter Chaf descended from the Creator's %0a> throne, all the worlds trembled, and the throne itself, verging on collapse. %0a> The Creator then answered: "Chaf, what are you doing here? I will not create %0a> the world by you. Return to your place, for you exist in the word Kelayah %0a> (destruction) and in the word Kalah (bride)." %0a> %0a> The Creator's throne is the world of Beria. The appearance of the letter %0a> Mem before the Creator led to the letter Chaf falling from His throne. As a %0a> result, Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria trembled, as well as all the lower %0a> worlds with all their inhabitants. %0a> %0a> All the arguments that the letters raised in their wish for the world to be %0a> created with each of them is like raising MAN— a request for precise measure of %0a> help from Above in the form of Upper Light (called MAD), corresponding to %0a> that particular letter. %0a> %0a> If so, ZON will rule the world, and this ruling is effected by the very Light %0a> descending from ZON in the exact quantity of MAD that each letter evoked %0a> and caused, for the MAD precisely corresponds to the MAN in both quantity %0a> and quality, whereas MAN is the actual property of the letter. Hence, each letter %0a> argues that it can draw the kind of Light from Above that will surely bring all %0a> creatures to the goal. %0a> %0a> Similarly, the Creator's answers to each of the twenty-two letters of ZON de %0a> Atzilut constitute the descending MAD (the Upper Light, strength, help) that %0a> precisely corresponds to the MAN raised by that particular letter. And when the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 165 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Upper Light that descends from a particular letter begins to rule the world, this %0a> signifies the Creator's reply to that letter. Since the impure forces cling to one of %0a> the letter's properties, as the Creator created two precisely balanced, opposing %0a> systems of pure and impure forces, this reveals the letter's inability to rule the %0a> world. And thus, the Creator dismissed each letter's individual claim to build %0a> the world by its property in order to bring it to the goal of creation. %0a> %0a> Herein lies the Creator's "game" with each of the twenty-two letters, giving %0a> each the opportunity to reveal its properties, power and forces, until it becomes %0a> clear from their aspirations and analysis, which of them truly merits the world %0a> being governed by it. %0a> %0a> From this we see that when the letter Mem began to reveal its great Light in %0a> the world, in doing so, it caused the fall of the Kisse (throne). This is so because %0a> the Kisse has two properties: (i) it covers and conceals the Creator, where the %0a> word Kisse derives from the word Kissui; (ii) it reveals the Creator's greatness in %0a> the worlds with the help of the three letters MeLeCH. Then, Malchut that became %0a> a Kissui, the Creator's cover, ascends and turns to Chaf— the Creator's own gar- %0a> ments—thus revealing the King (Creator), and it becomes a crown on His head. %0a> %0a> But as soon as the letter Mem, which was not clothed in Chaf, began to reveal %0a> the Light of the Creator's face, the letter Chaf fell from the Kisse (the throne of %0a> His Glory), stopped concealing Him, and stated that from now on only the %0a> Creator's revealed glory would rule over it, without any kind of concealment, as %0a> desired by Mem. %0a> %0a> Owing to Chaf s fall from the throne, two hundred thousand worlds that origi- %0a> nate from Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria, as well as the worlds below them, %0a> shook and trembled on the verge of collapse. For the entire connection between %0a> the lower degree or Partzuf and the one above it lies in the fact that Malchut of the %0a> Upper Degree becomes Keter of the lower. And the property of the letter Chaf con- %0a> sists in clothing Malchut of an Upper spiritual object in Keter of a lower one. %0a> %0a> There are three distinctive features to the throne: (i) six steps leading to the %0a> throne, six Sefirot-Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod of the lower one; (ii) four %0a> legs of the throne, the Light in Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina-Daat of the lower one; %0a> (iii) Malchut of the Upper One that descends to the lower one, clothes into it, %0a> and all the Light from the Upper One is passed through her to the lower one. %0a> %0a> Thus, when Chaf fell from the throne of the Creator's glory, the connection %0a> between the world of Atzilut and the throne (world of Beria) was severed. This %0a> is so because Chaf (Malchut of the world of Atzilut) that clothes in Sefirot Keter- %0a> Hochma-Bina-Daat of the world of Beria pours all the Light onto the world of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 166 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Beria, called the throne of His glory. But when Chaf fell from the throne, the %0a> connection between the world of Atzilut and the world of Beria was severed, %0a> Chaf trembled, for it lost the power to bestow upon the world of Beria, and two %0a> hundred thousand worlds (Hochma and Bina out of Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina- %0a> Daat of the world of Beria) trembled in fear of collapsing, for they lost all of their %0a> life-force, which they receive from the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> Similarly, in the world of Atzilut, Bina of the world of Atzilut, the Creator, is %0a> connected with ZON. This is because Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut consists %0a> of ten Sefirot, and her last Sefira, Malchut, clothes in ZA of the world of Atzilut %0a> with the property of the letter Chaf. Malchut of the Sefira Bina, which clothes in %0a> ZA, is the letter Chaf. And this letter Chaf is the Creator's throne in ZA. For the %0a> Creator is Bina, Sefira above ZA. And ZA becomes a throne for Bina. And during %0a> the fall, the connection between Bina and ZA is severed, since Chaf is Malchut of %0a> Bina; it clothes into ZA and passes all the Light to him. %0a> %0a> And it therefore trembled (lost its ability to bestow upon ZA), and so did %0a> two hundred thousand worlds, which are the Light for ZA, called Hochma and %0a> Bina or KHBD— the four legs of the throne— for all the Light departed from %0a> them. And the worlds trembled in fear of collapsing, that is, Sefirot Hesed-Gevura- %0a> Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod in ZA that include all the worlds below them, for all the %0a> Light of Bina departed thence. %0a> %0a> The Creator told the letter Chaf that because it fell from the throne of His %0a> glory, the first three Sefirot of ZA trembled, and all the other worlds are on the %0a> verge of total collapse and destruction without any hope of restoration; hence, %0a> Chaf must return to its place in the throne of glory. %0a> %0a> Chaf's return to its place in the Creator's throne takes place just as He %0a> refuses to create the world with the letter Mem, for the world needs a King. That %0a> is, the trembling of the letter Chaf as it fell from the Creator's throne, which %0a> in turn, made the worlds tremble in fear of possible collapse, and the Creator's %0a> answer to the letter Mem transpire simultaneously. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER YOD %0a> %0a> 32. The letter Yod entered and said: "Maker of the world! It would be good %0a> to create the world by me, for Your Holy name begins with me." The Creator %0a> replied: "It is sufficient that you are inscribed in My Name, in Me, and all of %0a> your aspirations are to Me, and you should not be uprooted from it all." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 167 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Since Yod is the first letter of the Creator's name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a> Hey), the beginning of the Creator's revelation to creatures, the first degree %0a> of the Upper Light, the letter Yod argued for the world to be created with %0a> its properties, for the world would then be absolutely guaranteed complete %0a> correction. However, the Creator objects to it. As was already stated, the letters' %0a> questions and the Creator's answers signify the Creator playing with each letter, %0a> where the letters' questions are their MAN, and the Creator's answers are MAD %0a> in the form of the Upper Light. %0a> %0a> So, by telling Yod, "It is sufficient," the Creator thus explained the creation of %0a> restriction— that the Light is only allowed to descend to its level, but no further. %0a> And this restriction is fixed in the Creator's name Shadday (Shin-Dalet-Yod). After %0a> Yod began to spread with the great Light, the Creator stopped it, forbidding it %0a> to spread to the letter Tav, but only to Shin (as was said above, in item 25). He %0a> said to it: "Enough, and do not spread further. Otherwise you will not be able %0a> to remain forever in My Name HaVaYaH." %0a> %0a> As the sages said: "My Name is not pronounced as it is written. For it is %0a> written HaVaYaH, but pronounced Adonay" (Talmud, Pesahim, 50). Indeed, %0a> the name HaVaYaH is not subject to change, as it is written: "For I, the Lord %0a> (HaVaYaH), do not change" (Malachi, 3:6). For corruption and its correction %0a> emerge in the days of the world's existence, meaning that constant changes are %0a> coming. Therefore, until the end of correction, the Creator is called Adonay, for %0a> this name is subject to change, and not HaVaYaH, which can never be altered. %0a> %0a> Yet, in the future, after the end of correction, HaVaYaH will be pronounced %0a> as it is written. Therefore, the Creator said, "If I see some fault or evil in you, %0a> by this you will be removed from My Name, for My Name, HaVaYaH, may not %0a> contain anything flawed or corrected— neither corruption nor correction. And %0a> this is why the world cannot be created by your properties." There are three %0a> degrees in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH: in the Sefira Hochma of ZA, in %0a> Hochma of AVI, and in Hochma of Arich Anpin, called "concealed wisdom." %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH begins with a dot, which then turns into Yod. Subsequently, Yod %0a> (Ohr Hochma) spreads to the sides and downward and turns into the letter Dalet, %0a> which consists of a horizontal roof-like line that indicates the property of Bina- %0a> Ima (mercy, Hassadim, width). When Ohr Hassadim stops spreading in width, %0a> Ohr Hochma begins to spread downward in the form of a vertical line. This is the %0a> leg of the letter Dalet, the property of Hochma-Aba. %0a> %0a> The common property of AVI is designated by the letter Dalet. AVI beget %0a> ZA, designated by the letter Vav inside the Dalet, and eventually forms the shape %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 168 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of the letter Hey. Thus, the request of ZA (Vav) to receive from AVI compels %0a> them to unite their properties of Hochma (vertical line) and Hassadim (horizontal %0a> line), with the help of the letter Yod. Consequently, AVI receive the Light from %0a> Yod and pass it on to ZA. %0a> %0a> The screen with the desires of Malchut is called "a point," since the collision %0a> between the screen and the coming Light yields Returning Light. And since the %0a> received Light always consists of ten Lights, the screen is called "ten points." %0a> %0a> Yod designates the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf Keter, from the Light %0a> of Hochma downwards, while Vav signifies the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf %0a> Hochma. However, there is no sign in HaVaYaH that indicates the diffusion of %0a> Light in Keter. %0a> %0a> Entrance or exit of the letter Yod in a word signifies either presence or %0a> absence of the Light of Hochma. There are four kinds of correction: %0a> %0a> 1. The First Ibur— conception of the small state of ZON. This is an %0a> absolutely passive spiritual state, where the letter Yod enters the %0a> word Ohr (Light) and transforms it into Avir (air), becoming the %0a> VAK of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> 2. The letter Yod exits the word Avir, which converts it back to Ohr: the %0a> Light of Hochma enters VAK of Partzuf; %0a> %0a> 3. The Second Ibur— conception of the Gadlut state of ZON: AHP of %0a> Bina ascend from ZON to Bina, and GE de ZON ascend with them, %0a> for they were together in the Katnut state, defined as conception of %0a> GE de ZON; %0a> %0a> 4. The diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER TET %0a> %0a> 33. The letter Tet entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a> to create the world with me, for it is by me that You are called Tov (Good)." %0a> The Creator replied: "I will not create the world by you, for your goodness is %0a> concealed within you and is invisible. Therefore, it cannot take any part in %0a> the world that I wish to create, and will only be revealed in the world to come. %0a> And since your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the palace will %0a> sink into the ground, for the letter Chet is opposite from you, and when you %0a> join together, the word CHeT (sin) will be formed. This is why these two %0a> letters are not recorded in the names of the holy tribes." The letter Chet %0a> immediately moved aside. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 169 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The letter Tet, whose numeric value of nine, is the inner property of the %0a> Sefira Yesod in ZA, while the outer property of Yesod in ZA is the letter Tzadik, %0a> whose numeric value of ninety, and it joins with Nukva de ZA, forming the %0a> notion of Tzadik (righteous one). Besides being the inner property of Yesod in %0a> ZA, Tet is also the ninth letter among the letters of Bina in ZA. %0a> %0a> Also, Tet is called Tov (good). And since Tov is called Tzadik, for it is the %0a> inner Light of Yesod, called Tzadik, to whom no impure forces could cling, Tet %0a> calls on the above to justify its claim to become the basis of the world. %0a> %0a> In the Talmud (Hagiga, 12), the sages wrote: "In the Light by which the %0a> Creator created the world, Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. %0a> But the Creator saw that the deeds of the generations of the Flood and the %0a> builders of the Tower of Babel are detrimental, and concealed that Light for the %0a> righteous in the future." Because the Creator saw that their actions will bring %0a> the threat of the clinging of the impure forces, He concealed this Light, Thus, %0a> the Light descended secretly from the Supernal Righteous (AVI) to the righteous %0a> one (Yesod in ZA), the letter Tet. %0a> %0a> And so the Creator told Tet that because He must conceal it from the sinners %0a> and only the righteous will be worthy of it in the world to come, it cannot %0a> partake in the creation and correction of the world, for the world is ZON, and %0a> the letter Tet is constantly in danger of being clung to by impure forces. %0a> %0a> And since this Light shines only secretly inside Yesod of ZA, and not %0a> openly, Nukva will not be able to receive this Light directly, but only through %0a> its concealment in her. Therefore, the gates of Nukva sink into her Sefira Yesod, %0a> which safeguards them against the clinging of the impure forces, and they are %0a> confident that the impure forces will not be able to rule over her gates. For even %0a> at the time of the ruin of the Temple, the impure forces could not rule over the %0a> gates of the Temple, and sank into the ground, that is, the ground consumed %0a> them. "But because you are in need of such protection, I cannot create the world %0a> with you," the Creator answered Tet. %0a> %0a> There are two pipes (channels) in Yesod de ZA in the world of Atzilut: the %0a> right one serves for the birth of the souls, and the left one for throwing away %0a> waste to the impure forces. The letter Chet is Hod, whose property is Malchut %0a> in ZA, the left pipe in Yesod of ZA, for the properties of the letter Chet are the %0a> properties of Ku/ included in Yesod, whereas Ku/ emanates Ner Dakik (tiny Light) %0a> to the impure forces, from which they receive the strength to be similar to an %0a> image of a pure man, as a monkey compared to a man, for the Creator created %0a> purity parallel to impurity. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 170 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> These two pipes are located very close to each other, separated only by a thin %0a> partition, called "a garlic husk." Consequently, the left pipe has the strength to %0a> rule over the right one, thereby forming CHeT (numerical value 8 + 9 = 17). %0a> %0a> The numerical value of CHeT (17) equals that of the word TOV (9 + 6 + %0a> 2 = 17), which means that the impure force opposes the pure one. And if the %0a> right pipe (the letter Tet) prevails, the word CHeT (sin) will turn into TOV %0a> (good, goodness). %0a> %0a> Since the left pipe (CHeT) has the strength to rule over the right one (Tet), %0a> the impure forces can suck the Upper Light for themselves. This would give %0a> power to the sinners of the world. This is why neither diet nor Tet are present in %0a> the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, to show that they (the tribes) are above %0a> the letter Chet, the root of all the opposing impure forces. %0a> %0a> When all the letters merited receiving a blessing through the letter Bet, they %0a> lined up in their alphabetical order, in which the letters Tet and Reish joined. %0a> The letter Tet ascended, but did not take its place until the Creator asked her: %0a> "Tet, why did you ascend, but do not take your place?" It replied: "You created %0a> me to begin the words Tov (goodness) and Torah, as it is written: 'And the %0a> Creator saw that the Light was good.' How then can I join and stand beside the %0a> letter Reish, when it begins the word Rah (evil)?" %0a> %0a> The Creator answered: "Return to your place, for it is precisely you that %0a> needs the letter Reish. For man, whom I intend to create, combines all those %0a> properties— you as the right property, and Reish as the left." After that, both Tet %0a> and Reish returned to their places. %0a> %0a> Three lines emerge in ZA of the world of Atzilut. However, they emerge from %0a> their source, Bina. (As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascends to Bina, %0a> which leads to Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut falling into a lower Partzuf, into ZA.) Bina %0a> is called Eloh-im (Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem), and as a result of second restriction, %0a> her part Ale£>h-Lame%3ci-He)i (the ELEH of the word Eloh-im, AHP) fell into a lower %0a> Partzuf, to ZA. Only the letters Yod-Mem (the IM of Eloh-im) remained in Bina. %0a> This means that only half, ( VAK, GE) remained in her from the previous level of %0a> GAR. Whatever is left is designated by a sign called Holam—Vav with a dot above %0a> it, as this is the right line, Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Then, in the big state, the letters Ale£>h-Lame%3ciHe;y (ELEH) returned to Bina %0a> and joined with Yod-Mem (IM). Subsequently, the level of GAR returned, yet the %0a> Light of Hochma in Bina was incomplete, for the Light of Hassadim disappeared %0a> and the Light of Hochma cannot shine without the Light of Hassadim. The %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 171 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> returned letters A-L-H are Shuruk—Vav with a dot inside it, because, due to the %0a> restrictions in it, it constitutes the left line. %0a> %0a> These restrictions are effective until ZON, upon ascending to Bina, begin to %0a> receive the Light, and the middle line emerges and reduces GAR of Hochma in %0a> the left line. As a result, the right line joins with the left: Ohr Hochma shines in %0a> the Ohr Hassadim. This middle line is called Hirik—Vav with a dot under it, or %0a> the screen of Hirik, for the Light enters the Partzuf because of it. %0a> %0a> And since Bina regained GAR with ZA's help, ZA, now that he had acquired %0a> the three lines, begins to receive this Light from Bina, too. Yod-Mem (IM), Tet %0a> and Holam constitute the right line, Aleph-Lamed-Hey (ELEH), Reish and Shuruk %0a> constitute the left. %0a> %0a> Now let us translate this into the language of Sefirot. When Bina returned %0a> once more to the state of Gadlut, ELEH returned to IM, the left line merged %0a> with the right, and this drove Tet (right line, Hassadim) away from Reish (left %0a> line). This is because being opposite to each other, they cannot stand side by %0a> side until the Creator (ZA, middle line) reduces the GAR of both the left and %0a> right lines by the force of His screen, which is expressed by the words: "And the %0a> Creator commanded it to return to its place." %0a> %0a> GAR de Hochma is called Man 'ula— the lock that prevents the Light from %0a> entering a Partzuf, and its diminution is called Miftacha— the key that opens a %0a> passage for the Light, VAK of Hochma, to spread in the left line into a Partzuf. %0a> Then, Tet, the right line, receives Ohr Hochma from the left, joins with Reish, %0a> receiving from it the Light of Hochma. Otherwise it would have remained in %0a> VAK. Adam, too, is created from the union of these two lines. %0a> %0a> But why was the letter Tet reluctant to join with the letter Reish, and had %0a> to be forced to do so by the Creator? In the spiritual world, a root rules over %0a> all its branches, and the branches submit to its rule. Therefore, Tet did not %0a> wish to join with Reish, as it was then bound to become a branch and submit %0a> to its root, Reish. %0a> %0a> However, the Creator wanted Tet to receive the Light of Hochma from Reish %0a> so that this union would enable man to receive the Light of GAR. Thus, when %0a> ELEH return to Bina, He made it so Bina's restrictions would be weakened so as %0a> to allow the Reish to join with the Tet and receive the Light of Hassadim from it. It %0a> follows that Tet becomes the root with regard to Reish, for without its Hassadim, %0a> Reish would be unable to shine, due to the restrictions placed on its Light. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 172 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE LETTER ZAYIN %0a> %0a> 34. The letter Zayin entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a> to create the world by me, as Shabbat is preserved with me, for it is written: %0a> 'Remember (Zachor) the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it.'" The Creator %0a> replied: "I will not create the world by you, for within you is a force of war, as %0a> sabers and swords, called Klei Zayin (weaponry), are made by you. And you %0a> are like the letter Nun, with which the world was not created, for within it is %0a> Nefilah (fall)" (item 29). Having heard that, the letter Zayin left Him. %0a> %0a> The letter Zayin is depicted as a combination of Vav and Yod, as a head over %0a> it, which signifies the big state and the great Light in Malchut, ZA's wife, for %0a> Malchut includes herself into her husband, ZA (designated by Vav), and becomes %0a> a crown (Yod) on his head. Together, these two letters, Vav with Yod standing %0a> above it, form the letter Zayin. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is written: "Remember the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it holy." %0a> As a result of Shabbat's elevation, that is, Nukva's ascent to the head of ZA, when %0a> she becomes his crown, she includes herself in the word Zachor (remember) and %0a> receives the name Nukva Kedoshah (holy Nukva). This is why the letter Zayin %0a> claimed that since this Light is so great and holy that it brings absolute rest on %0a> this day, for purity is completely separated from impurity in this state called %0a> Shabbat, it is worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world. %0a> %0a> Zayin is the Sefira Net^ah in ZA. When Nukva is included in Net^ah and %0a> merges with its properties, she gains the strength to ascend along with ZA to %0a> AVI. There she becomes a crown on his head, by which he is adorned, which %0a> signifies the day of Shabbat. However, since this correction occurs solely as a %0a> result of her inclusion in the male essence and their ascent to AVI, and not in %0a> her regular place, where she normally abides with ZA, Nukva cannot be corrected %0a> completely during the 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that when Nukva returns to her place on weekdays, her %0a> connection with the letter Za^in is defined as a Kli Zayin (weapon), and all the wars %0a> with the impure forces emerge from her, like the weekdays that prepare Shabbat. %0a> %0a> For every man must defeat the impure force within him on the weekdays, %0a> and thus merit the King's daughter— Shabbat. However, during the 6,000 years, %0a> the Light of Shabbat is insufficient for the neutralization of the impure forces, %0a> for weekdays return and surround the Shabbat. This continues until the end %0a> of correction, when there will be only Shabbat as the day of absolute perfection %0a> for all eternity. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 173 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This is also why the Creator replied to Zayin: "I will not create the world with %0a> you, for when you are in your place, your Light is not yet perfect. Only after you %0a> defeat the impure forces in war will man be able to attain you." And the shape of %0a> the letter Vav (ZA) resembles a spear, ready to strike and pierce through the impure %0a> forces. For Gevurot (courage) signifies the left line of Bina's male part (Nun). %0a> %0a> THE LETTERS VAV AND HEY %0a> %0a> 35. The letter Vav entered and said: "It would be good to create the world %0a> with me, for I am a letter from Your Name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey)." %0a> The Creator replied: "Vav, both you and the letter Hey should just be glad to %0a> be contained within My Name. This is why I will not create the world with %0a> your properties." %0a> %0a> Although the letter Yod expressed a similar request, Vav thought that Yod %0a> had been turned down because of its excessive size (spiritual force). This is why %0a> Vav claimed that it would be good to create the world with its properties, i.e., %0a> according to the letters Vav-Hey in the name HaVaYaH, with the Light of the %0a> Supernal Bina (Ima) of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> The Creator responded with the same answer he had given to the letter %0a> Yod— that He restricted it by saying to DaY (Dalet-Yod): "Stop at the letter Shin %0a> and spread no more, so that the impure forces would not cling to you." Hence, %0a> the letters Vav and Hey are not suitable for the world to be created with their %0a> properties, for even they need protection against the impure forces. %0a> %0a> Sefira Tifferet is designated by the big letter Vav (Vav with a head), for it has %0a> all six (Vav) Sefirot: Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. Yesod is the Sefira that is %0a> responsible for passing the Light from ZA to Malchut. This is why it has the same %0a> Light as in Malchut— NHY without HGT, and this is also why Yesod is called the %0a> small Vav (Vav without a head). %0a> %0a> THE LETTERS DALET AND QIMEL %0a> %0a> 36. The letters Dalet and Qimel appeared before the Creator. However, the %0a> Creator told them right away: "It is enough that you are both together, so that %0a> as long as the poor exist on earth, there is someone to treat them with mercy %0a> (LiQmol Hesed)." The letter Dalet derives from Dalut (poverty), while Qimel %0a> renders mercy to it (Qomelet Hassadim). "Therefore, you cannot part, and it %0a> is enough for you to aid one another in this way." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 174 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It was already stated (item 24) that although Dalet receives the Light from %0a> Gzme! and its sharp right angle protrudes from the Light of Hassadim, the impure %0a> forces are nonetheless strong enough to cling to it, separate it and make the %0a> sharp angle smooth, thus transforming it into the letter Reish. %0a> %0a> This is why the letter Dalet requires special protection so as not to be %0a> corrupted and to be able to continue being fulfilled by Gimel so as to keep the %0a> needy ones (Dalut) in the world from disappearing. Thus, it is sufficient for %0a> these two forces to sustain and complement one another, to fulfill one another %0a> in reciprocal union so as to prevent the impure forces from ruling. And this %0a> role is enough from them. This is why the Creator did not want to create the %0a> world with them. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER BET %0a> %0a> 37. The letter Bet entered and said to the Creator: "Maker of the world, it %0a> would be good to create the world by me, as by me You are blessed Above and %0a> below. For Bet is Berachah (blessing)." The Creator replied to Bet: "Of course, %0a> I will create the world by you, and you shall be the basis of the world!" %0a> %0a> The letter Bet is the property of Hochma (wisdom), or rather Hesed in Hochma, %0a> a point in a palace, for Ohr Hassadim is a palace for Ohr Hochma and is called %0a> Berachah (blessing). Passing through all of the worlds from the Creator down to %0a> the lowest degree of the lowest world, this Light does not diminish in any way. %0a> %0a> Rather, just as this Light is at the Highest Degree that receives it from the %0a> World of Infinity, it is just as great, magnificent, and mighty in the world of %0a> Atzilut, and likewise all the way down to the world of Assiya. And it does not get %0a> coarser or weaker as it passes through all the screens from Above downwards. %0a> %0a> That is why the letter Bet vied for the world to be created with its properties, %0a> as the Light of blessing is the same both Above and below; no screen can weaken %0a> it and no coarse desires can harm it. %0a> %0a> This is also why the property of mercy (Hassadim) is most suitable for the %0a> creation of the world, for no impure forces can cling to it. This is because the %0a> impure forces can only cling to a place where there is a deficiency. And since %0a> there is no deficiency of any kind in the property of mercy, there can never be %0a> any contact between Bet and the impure forces. %0a> %0a> The Creator agreed with Bet that its property is perfect and suitable for %0a> the creation of the universe by Him. As it is said: "Olam (world) Hesed (mercy) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 175 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YiBaneh (will be built)," where YiBaneh means Boneh (building) and HaVana %0a> (understanding). (In Hebrew, the letters Vav and Bet are denoted by the letter %0a> Bet). This is because the Creator determined that this property is entirely %0a> sufficient for precisely evaluating and separating pure from impure. %0a> %0a> And if man seeks an idol in the Creator's stead, a Berachah (blessing) does %0a> not descend upon him, for blessing stems from the Creator alone. Thus, it is %0a> possible to determine who is righteous and who is a sinner, who works for the %0a> Creator's sake and who works for himself, for the world is built by mercy. %0a> %0a> Yet, the Creator did not order the Light of Mercy to rule the world. He merely %0a> intended it for a good beginning, sufficient to bring the world to perfection. This %0a> is because the Light of Hassadim is incomplete (VAK, and not GAR), insufficient %0a> for begetting new souls, for their union and multiplication, as no Partzuf (spiritual %0a> object) can beget until it attains the full Light of Hochma, termed GAR or head. %0a> Until then, the Partzuf remains in a state of imperfection. %0a> %0a> Our normal (the lowest possible) state is determined by the property of the %0a> letter Bet. Hence, the Creator laid it as the basis for the creation of the world. In %0a> other words, the basis of a state is a state of a pure Partzuf (object), when nothing %0a> at all can diminish or impede it. %0a> %0a> In such a state, an addition of Ohr Hochma to Ohr Hassadim, necessary for %0a> the birth of a new Partzuf is no longer considered basic and essential. Rather, it %0a> is defined as an addition, i.e., it depends solely on the good deeds of the lower %0a> ones. And the fundamental Light, VAK, will never be lacking. %0a> %0a> THE LETTER ALEPH %0a> %0a> 38. The letter Aleph stood outside and did not enter to appear before the %0a> Creator. The Creator said to it: "Why do you not come to me like all the %0a> other letters?" Aleph replied: "Because I saw all the letters leaving your %0a> presence without the desired answer. And besides, I saw You presenting the %0a> letter Bet with this great gift. And, indeed, the King of the universe cannot %0a> take back his gift and give it to another!" The Creator replied: "Although I %0a> will create the world by the letter Bet, it is you who will stand at the head %0a> of all the letters, and there shall be no unity in Me, but through you alone; %0a> all accounts and deeds of this world shall always begin with you, and all of %0a> unity shall be in you alone." %0a> %0a> As we already know, all the letters' questions are Aliyat MAN— their individual %0a> requests, prayers, desires to ascend to the Creator. And the Creator's answers %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 176 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to them are called Yeridat MAD— the descent of the Light from Above, giving %0a> strength and abundance according to the letters' requests. The great perfection %0a> in the letter Aleph stems not from the lower ones' request for spiritual ascent and %0a> correction, but from a force (Light) descending from Above and elevating those %0a> that dwell below. %0a> %0a> This is why from the beginning of correction to its end, Aleph (unlike the %0a> other letters, whose properties fuel the process of correction during the 6,000 %0a> years) is never stimulated to raise its request to the Creator. And only if the Light %0a> that bestows strength for spiritual ascent descends from Above and begins to %0a> shine upon Aleph will it be stimulated. However, this will only take place at the %0a> end of correction. %0a> %0a> Aleph did not raise its plea (MAN) to the Creator, for it saw that all the other %0a> letters asked, but to no avail, for there was an opposite property in the system %0a> of the impure forces against each of their properties. Therefore, Aleph decided %0a> that it was no better than the rest, that there is a corresponding impure force %0a> against it as well. %0a> %0a> Furthermore, it raised no requests (MAN) to the Creator because it saw that %0a> the Creator decided to create the world with the letter Bet, mercy. And since it %0a> had no doubt that His decision was irrevocable, it decided not to ask Him. %0a> %0a> Although it is true that the world was already created with the property of %0a> Bet, and that the Creator will not turn His gift over to another letter, the Partzuf %0a> that was created by the property of Bet is incomplete, small, VAK without a head. %0a> And since a Partzuf needs a head in order to reach the state of Gadlut, which is %0a> possible only when the Partzuf is filled not only with the Light of Mercy (Has- %0a> sadim), but also with the Light of Wisdom (Hochma), more letters are necessary %0a> for the connection, conception and birth of a new Partzuf, a new state. %0a> %0a> A state of Gadlut can only be achieved with the help of the property of the %0a> letter Aleph. Only Aleph can bring a Partzuf to Gadlut, to supplement its body, %0a> VAK, with a head, GAR, Mochin— the Light of Hochma. The letter Aleph brings %0a> the union between ZA and Malchut in a face-to-face position, whereas previously, %0a> in Katnut, while being filled with only the Light of Mercy, ZA and Malchut were %0a> connected back-to-back. This is why Alef>h creates a head for all the letters, and %0a> hence stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a> %0a> The Creator said: " That is why My Unity in the world is expressed only through %0a> the property of the letter Aleph. Furthermore, all rewards and punishments, %0a> distancing and drawing nearer, as well as the aspiration for spiritual correction %0a> (Teshuvah), all of which lead to the achievement of the end of correction, will %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 177 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> only happen by the property of the Aleph. I have made Bet the basis of the Partzuf %0a> so that it would be in no way dependent on the deeds of the lower ones. Thus, %0a> even if they begin to sin, those above will remain unaffected." %0a> %0a> He continued: "But the Light in you, Aleph, is directly related to the actions %0a> of the lower ones. So if they sin, the Light of Wisdom (the Light of GAR in %0a> you) will immediately disappear. But if they correct their actions (Teshuvah), the %0a> Light of Hochma will return. And My unity with all the creatures at the end of %0a> correction will only be realized through the letter Aleph." %0a> %0a> Letters are Kelim (plural for Kli— vessel), desires. And this refers to both the %0a> individual letters of the alphabet and those that form words. In the names of %0a> spiritual objects, letters signify the force of their desire, which the Light can fill. %0a> Letters of a simple name, without filling, designate its basis without Light— Kli %0a> of Auiut zero with the Light of Nefesh. Letters of a fulfilled name designate the %0a> magnitude of desires that are filled by Light. %0a> %0a> There are two sources of letters: Yod and Aleph. Yod is a genuine source, for %0a> when we write something, we begin with a dot (Yod), and then, as we proceed %0a> from the dot in one of the four directions, we get a line. Letters are Kelim, %0a> desires, in which the Light (pleasure) is received. %0a> %0a> A desire for something specific may only emerge if: (i %0a> unconscious desire is filled with delight, and (ii) the delight exits the desire %0a> It is the memories (Reshimot) of past pleasures that lead to the emergence of a %0a> true desire to receive it, to feel it once more. And this is the very desire thai %0a> is called Kli. %0a> %0a> A filled Kli cannot be called a desire, for it is satisfied. Therefore, expulsion of %0a> ie Light and sensation of spiritual descent constitute the period of the creation %0a> ew Kelim for future receptions of Light, for new attainments. Because the %0a> first restriction is the reason for the disappearance of Light from all the vessels %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> However, the second restriction is the only true root of all the worlds, %0a> because the first restriction was only made on a point, (Phase Four, Malchut, %0a> the fourth letter Hey in the Creator's name HaVaYaH). The second restriction, %0a> however, was made on Bina, in whom the two points, Bina and Malchut, were %0a> joined. The union of the two points forms a line, either vertical or horizontal. If %0a> it is a horizontal line, it is called "firmament" or Parsa. %0a> %0a> The sum of consequences of both the first and second restrictions forms %0a> a slanted line (\); GE (Keter-Hochma) is depicted to its right, and AHP (Bina- %0a> ZA-Malchut) to its left. Keter-Hochma remain on their previous level and are %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 178 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> designated by the letter Yod, the first root of the world, whereas, a result of the %0a> second restriction, designated by a slanted line (\), Bina-ZA-Malchut fell to a lower %0a> level. And since the letter Yod is the first, though a very remote root of the worlds, %0a> and all the worlds were created afterwards and in accordance with the law of the %0a> second restriction, the letter Aleph stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a> %0a> The kind of Light that fills the spiritual Kli or Partzuf can also be seen from %0a> its designation: if it is filled with the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), the filling %0a> is designated by the letter Yod; and if it is filled with the Light of Mercy (Ohr %0a> Hassadim), it is the letter Aleph. %0a> %0a> 39. The Creator made the Upper letters, which refer to the Sefira Bina, %0a> large, and the lower letters that refer to Mcdchut— small. Therefore it is said: %0a> "BeresHeet Barah" (in the beginning He created)— two words that begin with %0a> Bet, and then Elokim Et (the Creator Himself)— two words that begin with %0a> Aleph. The first set of Aleph and Bet are letters of Bina, and the second set %0a> of Aleph and Bet are letters of Malchut. And they should mutually affect one %0a> another with their properties. %0a> %0a> When the Upper One wishes to give Light to the lower one, it should clothe %0a> in the lower one, signified by the first two letters Bet and the two letters Aleph %0a> in the first four words of the Torah. For the first, Upper Bet is Bina, the second, %0a> lower Bet is ZA, and the first Bet clothes into the second one. %0a> %0a> Similarly, the first Aleph refers to Bina and clothes into the second Aleph in %0a> ZA so as to fill it with Light. Therefore, the two letters Bet are like one letter Bet %0a> and the two letters Aleph are like one letter Aleph, since the lower letter merely %0a> constitutes the influence of the Upper One, which tells us that the Upper Partzuf %0a> fills the lower one. %0a> %0a> The world cannot be created with Aleph, for the word Arm (cursed) begins %0a> with it, and had the world been created with Aleph, the impure forces, called %0a> "cursed," would have received great power from the pure forces, called Baruch %0a> (blessed). This is why the world (Nukva of ZA) is created with the letter Bet. %0a> Likewise, Adam in Nukva of ZA is also created by the power of Bet. Thus, Malchut %0a> of the world of Atzilut constitutes the root of all creation, all the worlds, and all %0a> that inhabit them. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Supernal Wisdom %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 40. Rabbi Yudai asked, "What does the word BERESHEET mean?" It is %0a> the wisdom, upon which the world, ZA, is established to enter the concealed %0a> supernal secrets, namely the Light of Bina. Here are the six Supernal and %0a> great properties, VAK de Bina, from which everything emerges. The six river %0a> mouths, VAK de ZA, that flow into the Great Sea (Malchut) were formed from %0a> them. The word BERESHEET consists of the words BARAH (created) and %0a> SHEET (Aramaic: six), meaning that six properties were created. Who created %0a> them? He who is unmentioned, concealed, and unknown: Arich Anpin. %0a> %0a> There are two types of Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) in the world of Atzilut: %0a> %0a> 1. The original Light, Ohr Hochma of AA, called "the concealed Ohr %0a> Hochma." This Light of Hochma is present only in Partzuf AA and %0a> does not spread to the lower Partzufim. %0a> %0a> 2. Ohr Hochma that descends via thirty-two paths from Bina, who ascended %0a> to Rosh de AA to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Hence, the %0a> word Beresheet means Be-Resheet, with-Hochma. However, this is not %0a> the true Ohr Hochma that is concealed in AA, but rather the Light that %0a> descends via thirty-two paths from Bina to ZA and sustains ZON. %0a> %0a> It is written that the world is established on the "concealed supernal secrets," %0a> for when ZON (called "world") receive the Light of Hochma of thirty-two paths, %0a> they ascend to AVI, the concealed supernal secrets. Hence, it is said that ZON %0a> enter the concealed supernal secrets and attain the degree of AVI, as the lower %0a> one that ascends to the Upper One becomes equal to it in its properties. %0a> %0a> The word BERESHEET, besides being divided into BE-RESHEET, is also %0a> divided into BARAHSHEET (in Hebrew, both words are spelled the same), %0a> which translates as CREATED SIX— created six Sefirot (properties), called VAK %0a> (abbreviation of the words Vav Ketzavot, six extremities/ properties of ZA, from %0a> which all creatures emerge). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 179 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 180 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Sefira Bina fulfills the function of the Sefira Hochma, the source of Ohr %0a> Hochma for ZA. Because Maichut ascended to Bina, and Bina departed from Rosh %0a> de AA and became like its Guf (body), she cannot receive the Ohr Hochma of AA. %0a> %0a> But then, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, human beings who %0a> are spiritually present in the worlds of BYA, Bina returns to Rosh de AA, receives %0a> Ohr Hochma from AA, passes it to ZON, and ZON pass it to all the worlds. It %0a> follows that all the worlds emerged from these six properties (extremities), into %0a> which Bina was divided. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written that all six riverheads originate from Bina, and descend %0a> into the Great Sea. Bina's division into six properties, VAK, when she exits Rosh %0a> de AA, is called "six sources," for this is only a source of Light for ZA. But then, %0a> when Bina returns to Rosh de AA, they become Ohr Hochma, called the rivers that %0a> descend to Partzuf ZA. %0a> %0a> And they are called "six rivers," as it is written: "He will drink off the brook %0a> in the way; therefore, will he lift up the head" (Tehilim, 110:7). Afterwards, ZA %0a> passes this Light into the Great Sea, to his Nukva. The rivers and brooks signify %0a> the Light of ZA. VAK de Bina is considered the sources of the Light of Wisdom, %0a> Hochma, for it emerged from Bina in the form of VAK with the sole purpose of %0a> creating a source of Light for ZON. And had Bina not emerged, ZON would %0a> have had no chance of receiving the Light. %0a> %0a> The word Beresheet has several meanings: Bere = Barah— created six properties %0a> without Ohr Hochma, as the word Barah signifies concealment. Hence, the word %0a> Beresheet has two meanings: %0a> %0a> 1. Hochma, as the word Resheet means Hochma. %0a> %0a> 2. Barah Sheet, which shows how the Sefira Hochma was divided into six %0a> parts without a Rosh, without Ohr Hochma. These six parts are the %0a> source of Light for ZON (called the "world"), and these six parts of ZA %0a> together with Maichut are called the "seven days of creation." %0a> %0a> However, since the word Barah is inside the word Beresheet, this means that %0a> it was created by "Him who is concealed and unknown," i.e., the concealed %0a> Hochma of Arich Anf>in, for it expelled Bina from its Rosh and turned her into %0a> VAK. In other words, it created the six parts described in Beresheet. %0a> %0a> Beresheet designates Hochma. The Light cannot descend to ZA until Ima-Bina %0a> comes outside, for because of Tzimtzum Bet, ZAT de Bina fell to ZON. Hence, when %0a> Bina is in Gadlut, ZA receives Ohr Hochma in his Kelim, the desires of Bina. The word %0a> Barah in Beresheet = Barah Sheet also means Bar (Hebrew, to exit, to transcend). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Lock and the Key %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 41. Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yosi were walking along a road. As they reached a %0a> field, Rabbi Chiya said to Rabbi Yosi, "The words BARAH SHEET (created %0a> six) certainly allude to BERESHEET, for the six Supernal Days, VAKde Bina, %0a> shine on the Torah (ZA), while the others, QAR de Bina, are concealed." %0a> %0a> ZA of the world of Atzilut is called the Torah. The six Supernal Days are VAK %0a> de Bina that are above ZA. Hence, the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET = %0a> BARAH (created) and SHEET (six) indicates that the Sefira Bina turns to the %0a> Sefira Hochma in order to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Since ZA is %0a> unable to receive all the Ohr Hochma (GAR de Hochma, the Light of the ten %0a> Sefirot) from Bina, but only VAK de Hochma (Light of six Sefirot), this is stressed %0a> in the word BARAH SHEET-CREATED SIX. This means that ZA receives %0a> from Bina the Light of only six Sefirot, HGT NHY or VAK de Hochma, whereas %0a> GAR de Hochma, the Light of Sefirot KHB, is concealed from him. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that although Partzuf Atik belongs to Tzimtzum Aleph %0a> (the first restriction), it is obliged to shine down on all the other Partzufim of %0a> the world of Atzilut, and on all the worlds BYA with the Light of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a> Therefore, with regards to the lower Partzufim, it appears as a Partzuf that belongs %0a> to Tzimtzum Bet. %0a> %0a> In other words, it deliberately imposed on itself an outward (with regards to %0a> others) restriction of its Light, to enable the lower Partzufim to receive from it. %0a> Hence, it elevated Malchut from the Peh to the Eynaim and made a Zivug on the %0a> screen that stands in Nikvey Eynaim, thus begetting Partzuf AA. %0a> %0a> This is why AA is a Partzuf with properties of the second restriction, and %0a> acts as Keter of the entire world of Atzilut instead of Atik. This was designed %0a> so by Partzuf Atik itself, which split into two parts: GE remained in Atik, and %0a> AHP became part of the second Partzuf, AA. And since Malchut ascended to NE %0a> %0a> 181 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 182 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (Nikvey Eynaim), Partzuf AA remained without Malchut, the Sefira Ateret Yesod %0a> was used in its stead, and Malchut became concealed in the NE of Partzuf Atik. %0a> Also, GE de Atik became concealed from the lower Partzufim, Malchut stood in %0a> NE of Rosh de Atik, AHP de Atik became GE de AA, and Ateret Yesod became %0a> Malchut de AA. %0a> %0a> All the subsequent Partzufim of the world of At^ilut emerged similar to %0a> these Partzufim. Thus, they all split into two parts, GE and AHP: Partzuf Bina %0a> was split into two Partzufim: GE de Bina formed Partzuf AVI and AHP de Bina %0a> formed Partzuf YESHSLT. Malchut ascended and remained in AVI, while Partzuf %0a> YESHSUT remained without Malchut. %0a> %0a> The same applies to ZON: GE formed the big ZON and AHP formed the %0a> small ZON. Malchut remained in NE of the big ZON, while the small ZON have %0a> only nine Se/irot without Malchut, which is replaced in them by Ateret Yesod, as in %0a> Partzuf Atik. Therefore, just as Keter (Atik) split into two parts: GAR = Atik and %0a> ZAT = AA, so was Bina divided into GAR = AVI and ZAT = YESHSUT, and ZON %0a> into GAR = the big ZON and ZAT = the small ZON Malchut remained in GAR %0a> and Ateret Yesod replaced it in ZAT. %0a> %0a> As a result, the Upper Part of each degree remains concealed, just like Partzuf %0a> Atik, for Malchut does not descend from the place where she had ascended (NE) %0a> to her previous place in the Peh. And although in Gadlut, AHP return to their %0a> place or ascend to their own GE (which is one and the same), GE do not become %0a> filled with Ohr Hochma (the Light of GAR) as a result, since Malchut remains %0a> concealed in GE. Moreover, Malchut exists under the ban of T^imt^um Aleph on %0a> the reception of Ohr Hochma. Hence, GE remain with Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Only the lower part of each degree is filled with the Light of GAR (Hochma) %0a> in Gadlut: there was Avir (air) = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish, then the letter Yod departed %0a> from this word, and only the letters Ale£>h-Vat/-Reish remained to form the word %0a> Ohr (Light)-Ohr Hochma or GAR. %0a> %0a> It follows that all Partzufim of the world of At^ilut have GE, GAR of Kelim, %0a> Sefirot KHB HGT with Ohr Hassadim, the Light of VAK, whereas AHP, Sefirot %0a> NHY, Vak de Kelim in the Gadlut of the Partzuf are filled with Ohr Hochma, %0a> the Light of GAR. GE (GAR de Kelim) are filled with the Light of VAK (Ohr %0a> Hassadim), and AHP (VAK de Kelim) are filled with the Light of GAR (Ohr %0a> Hochma). It is therefore said that there's no greater Light for ZA in the world %0a> of Atzilut than the Light of VAK = six days, while GAR are concealed even in %0a> the Partzufim above ZA. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Lock and the Key %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 183 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 42. However, it is said in the secrets of creation of BERESHEET that He %0a> who is Holy and Concealed established the laws in Bina, in the secret and %0a> concealed, meaning Mcdchut of Partzuf Atik, which is a Partzuf with Mcdchut %0a> of Tzimtzum Aleph, who ascended to Bina and removed AHP de AA below %0a> its Rosh. And the same law that He established in Bina He established and %0a> concealed within, and everything is locked under one key. And He hid this key %0a> in a hall. And although everything is hidden in that hall, the most important %0a> thing is in that key, for it locks and unlocks everything. %0a> %0a> HE WHO IS HOLY AND CONCEALED is AA, for its Hochma is concealed. %0a> THE LAWS ARE ESTABLISHED IN IT, meaning in Malchut de Atik. The %0a> deficiency of the Kelim de AHP is confirmed. Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph, called %0a> "the central point of all creation," is also the sole creation on which Tzimtzum %0a> Aleph was imposed. Contrary to her, if the screen stands not in Malchut, but in %0a> Yesod or, more precisely, in Ateret Yesod, the place of the covenant (circumcision), %0a> the place of the Zivug that was permitted after Tzimtzum Bet, this screen allows %0a> for the reception of Light. Hence, it is called the "point of population," and not %0a> the "central point." %0a> %0a> - Keter %0a> %0a> - Hochma %0a> %0a> - Bina %0a> %0a> - ZA Yesod %0a> %0a> - ZA— Malchut that received ZA's properties to "bestow," the popu- %0a> %0a> lated place %0a> %0a> - Malchut— no Zivug can be made; the deserted place %0a> %0a> The thing is that there is no GAR in AA, for the Supernal Malchut of Atik, %0a> within AA, is already corrected to the point of being in NE of her own Partzuf. %0a> In Gacllut, the screen descends from NE to Peh, which makes AHP return to %0a> their place, and a Zivug transpires on all ten Sefirot, which receive the GAR of %0a> the Light, Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the screen in NE is called a "lock," for it blocks the entry of GAR %0a> of the Light into the Partzuf. The GAR of the Light are called Ohr Hochma. Yet, %0a> by descending from NE to Peh, the screen lets the Light into the Partzuf, and is %0a> therefore called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils of the eyes). %0a> %0a> Although Atik itself is in NE together with Malchut, it affects AA, and not %0a> Atik itself, as AA was created by the screen, located not in Malchut, but in Ateret %0a> Yesod (or simply in Yesod), and there is no Malchut in it. This is why it is not %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 184 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut that rules in NE de AA, but Ateret Yesod. And this is why, unlike the %0a> Light of Atik, its Light can be attained, for Malchut in Atik is the central point, %0a> which does not make a Zivug on Ohr Hochma. Although with regards to Atik, AA %0a> is AHP of Atik, AA itself has its own GE and AHP. %0a> %0a> Subsequently, AA created AVI and confirmed the absence of Ohr Hochma in %0a> them, due to the absence of AHP de Kelim. These AHP are the HALL in which %0a> the entire Light of Hochma is concealed (GAR de Neshama, GAR de Haya, and %0a> GAR de Yechida). This KEY IS KEPT HIDDEN IN A HALL Bina is a hall for %0a> Ohr Hochma. Malchut ascends to GAR de Bina (AVI) and rules there, but the %0a> absence of Ohr Hochma is not felt there, for the properties of AVI want only Ohr %0a> Hassadim; this is what is important to them, as it completely substitutes the Ohr %0a> Hochma. And VAK de Bina is ruled by the key, Ateret Yesod. %0a> %0a> IN THAT KEY, FOR IT LOCKS AND UNLOCKS EVERYTHING— %0a> concealments and revelations are made by Malchut that stands in NE: when %0a> Malchut ascends to NE she conceals Ohr Hochma, since in such a case, the Partzuf %0a> remains without its Kelim of AHP— it cannot use its desires to "receive" for the %0a> Creator's sake. Consequently, it contains no Ohr Hochma, for Ohr Hochma can %0a> only be received in Kelim de AHP. %0a> %0a> And when a Partzuf receives strength from Above to resist the egoistic %0a> desires of reception of its Kelim de AHP, and can receive for the Creator's sake, %0a> this means that it has acquired a screen against its desires, and can also work %0a> with them for the Creator. It then brings its Malchut back from the NE to the %0a> Peh. Put differently, it elevates its Kelim (desires of AHP) to the Rosh and begins %0a> to calculate how much Light it can receive within them for the Creator's sake. %0a> However, the received pleasure must not be too great, or it will make the Partzuf %0a> enjoy it egoistically. Afterwards, the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma in its Guf. %0a> %0a> Thus, only Malchut that stands in NE allows or forbids the Light from %0a> entering the Partzuf. And since she must let the Light into the Partzuf in ZAT %0a> (where the rule belongs not to Malchut that ascended to NE, but to Ateret Yesod, %0a> called "key"), whereas the GAR of each Partzuf remain with Ohr Hassadim (they %0a> desire only the Light of Hassadim), letting the Light in or preventing it from %0a> entering the Partzuf depends only on the key, and not on Malchut herself. %0a> %0a> 43. That hall conceals tremendous treasures piled one upon the other. And %0a> there are fifty tightly closed gates in that hall, which are meant to block %0a> access to the Light. They were divided into four sides and became forty-nine %0a> gates, for one gate has no side, and it is unknown whether it exists above or %0a> below. Hence, it remained closed. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Lock and the Key %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 185 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> There are many types of GAR: GAR of Ohr Neshama, Haya, or Yechida. Each %0a> of them contains countless individual degrees and details. Hence, it is written, %0a> ONE UPON THE OTHER. Yet, as long as Malchut stands in NE, all these %0a> degrees of Light remain concealed and unknown. %0a> %0a> A gate signifies a vessel— a desire to receive the Light. In the spiritual world, %0a> there are no bodies, only desires. The desire itself is called "a body." If there is no %0a> desire, there is no body, as there is no vessel to receive the Light (pleasure). The %0a> bigger the desire, the "bigger" the body. However, all the bodies are similar in %0a> structure; just as a human body in our world consists of 613 parts, the spiritual %0a> body consists of 613 spiritual parts (desires). %0a> %0a> If one is able to use one of the desires of his spiritual body for the Creator's %0a> sake, such action is referred to as a Mitzva (commandment, good deed). The %0a> received Light is called "Torah." %0a> %0a> A spiritual Partzuf has a Rosh (head), the place where decisions are made. %0a> It contains only those desires that are known to be fit with a screen (resistance %0a> to the desires) to use them spiritually, altruistically, and to "reverse" them from %0a> "for one's own sake" to "for the sake of the Creator." If one has fulfilled all 613 %0a> commandments of the Torah and the seven Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) of the %0a> nations of the world (620 Mitzvot in all), he thereby ascends 620 degrees and %0a> completely merges with the Creator. %0a> %0a> To observe all the commandments means to completely fill one's spiritual %0a> Partzuf with the Light of the Torah by fulfilling observant commandments %0a> (Mitzvot Aseh— positive Mitzvot) and prohibitory commandments (Mitzvot Lo %0a> Taaseh— negative Mitzvot). The fulfillment of the later lies in the unwillingness to %0a> receive the pleasure that is found within them. %0a> %0a> There are two types of desires or gates: when they are closed and receive %0a> nothing, and when they open and receive the Upper Light. When they are %0a> all closed, there are fifty of them. However, only forty-nine of the fifty can be %0a> opened. There are ten Sefirot KHB HGT NHYM or five Sefirot KHB ZA-M (as ZA %0a> consists of six Sefirot HGT NHY). However, Malchut also consists of these six, %0a> and hence includes all ten Sefirot. And since each of the five Sefirot consists of %0a> ten, in all they make up fifty. %0a> %0a> However, since a Zivug is made not on Malchut, but on Ateret Yesod, Malchut %0a> de Malchut itself does not receive the Light. Instead, Light is received by the four %0a> Sefirot KHB ZA that precede Malchut. Each of them consists of ten, hence 4 x 10 = %0a> 40 plus nine Sefirot from Keter to Yesod in Malchut herself yields 40 + 9 = 49. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 186 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Only one Sefira (Malchut de Malchut) out of the fifty does not receive the %0a> Light. This is because until all the Kelim (desires) have been completely corrected, %0a> the Light cannot enter it, as it is known in advance that Malchut de Malchut has %0a> no strength to oppose such a powerful egoistic desire to receive pleasure. %0a> %0a> Instead of being in Malchut de Malchut, the screen stands in Yesod de %0a> Malchut, and this place is called Brith (Covenant), the place where the Mitzva of %0a> circumcision must be kept, so as to make a Zivug not on Malchut herself (on the %0a> first restriction), but on Yesod, or rather, Ateret Yesod (on the second restriction). %0a> Malchut de Malchut itself is called "Shaar Nun" (the 50 th gate). This refers to %0a> Malchut of each Partzuf in the worlds ABYA. %0a> %0a> And although Malchut of Partzuf AVI descends from NE de AVI to her place %0a> in Peh, while AHP and YESHSUT that clothe them ascend to the degree of %0a> AVI, and AVI merges with YESHSUT into one Partzuf, as a result of which, %0a> Ohr Hochma descends to them from AA, AVI are unwilling and therefore do %0a> not receive anything from Ohr Hochma, and remain only with Ohr Hassadim, as %0a> though Malchut had never even descended from E^nazm to Peh. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is impossible to tell by the Light of AVI whether Malchut is %0a> located at the NE or at the Peh. On the contrary, by looking at AVI, it always %0a> seems to us that Malchut stands at NE. Only by the state of YESHSUT can we %0a> determine Malchut's location, for when she ascends to AVI in Gadlut (big state), %0a> YESHSUT receive Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> Although Malchut herself can receive Ohr Hochma in AVI, since AVI receive %0a> no Ohr Hochma whatsoever, they do not utilize their own Malchut. Since %0a> YESHSUT already has Ateret Yesod instead of Malchut, it receives the Light or %0a> "opens up," whereas AVI remain closed. %0a> %0a> However, the absence of the 50 th gate, the Zivug on Malchut herself in %0a> YESHSUT, causes the absence of the corresponding Light of Hochma in all the %0a> Partzufim. It is written about it: "fifty gates of Bina, and all are given to Moshe, %0a> except for one, the last secret of the absence of the Upper Light." For this %0a> Upper Light can be received only within the Kelim (desires) of Malchut herself, %0a> of primordial egoism, which will occur at the end of all the corrections, at the %0a> completion of the 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> 44. Those gates have one lock with a narrow space inside for inserting the %0a> key. It is unmarked, and recognized only by the impress of the key, which is %0a> unknown in that narrow space, but only in the key itself. And it is written of %0a> this secret: BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a> CREATOR CREATED). "In the beginning" is the key, and all is concealed %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Lock and the Key %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 187 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> within it, as it unlocks and locks. And six gates are contained in this key, %0a> which locks and unlocks. When it locks those gates, encloses them within %0a> itself, it is written IN THE BEGINNING (BERESHEET): a revealed word, %0a> though it is usually concealed. BARAH (CREATED) is a concealed word %0a> everywhere, implying that the key unlocks it and locks it up. %0a> %0a> Malchut that stands in NE is called a "lock," for she prevents Ohr Hochma %0a> from entering the Partzuf. The entire Partzuf ends in Hochma (the Light can only %0a> be in K-H). Hence, it is merely Nefesh-Ruach. After all, in the absence of Kelim- %0a> Sefirot B-ZA-M, the Lights Neshama-Haya-Yechida are absent. Yesod de Malchut is %0a> the 49 th gate, the maximum that can be before the end of correction, for Malchut %0a> de Malchut itself is the 50 th gate. %0a> %0a> If the key (Ateret Yesod of the Light) enters Yesod de Malchut (the 49 th gate), %0a> then this Light lowers Malchut to her place, from NE to Peh. This Light opens %0a> the Partzuf and Ohr Hochma fills it. This is why Ateret Yesod is called a "key." %0a> %0a> However, there is a special Reshimo that allows one to not use Malchut de %0a> Malchut as a place of Zivug before the final correction of all the others (except %0a> for Malchut de Malchut, Kelim-desires). This Reshimo is in AVI: since they never %0a> receive Ohr Hochma (they do not use this key), their real AHP do not ascend. %0a> Nevertheless, even their false AHP is sufficient to let YESHSUT receive Ohr %0a> Hochma and realize that knowledge signifies the presence of Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> If the Light that corresponds to Ateret Yesod enters the corresponding Sefira %0a> in Malchut (in Yesod de Malchut, the 49 th Sefira), then Malchut (the 50 th gate) does %0a> not forbid this Light to fill the Partzuf, does not "lock up" the Partzuf, as she %0a> contains the Reshimo of prohibition only on that which enters Malchut herself. %0a> The reason for it is that the Reshimo (the key's memory) rules in ZAT de Bina, %0a> that is, in YESHSUT. Hence, this Light is called a "key." %0a> %0a> And the word BERESHEET-IN THE BEGINNING-includes in itself only %0a> the key (Ateret Yesod, the 49 th Sefira), excluding Malchut de Malchut, the 50 th gate. %0a> However, none of the Sefirot KHB of all the Partzufim of the world of At^ilut %0a> receive Ohr Hochma; Ohr Hassadim shines within them instead. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the words IN THE BEGINNING CREATED (BERESHEET %0a> BARAH) mean CONCEALED HOCHMA, for the word BARAH (created) is %0a> derived from the notion of BAR (beyond), which signifies moving Malchut de %0a> Malchut beyond the reception of Ohr Hochma; hence, this part of the Kelim was %0a> locked up by the absence of Light. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVRAHAM %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 45. Rabbi Yosi said, "I heard from the great source of Light, i.e., from Rabbi %0a> Shimon Bar-Yochai, that BARAH is a concealed word, the key to which locked %0a> it up and did not unlock it. And since the key locked up the word BARAH, %0a> there was no world and no possibility of its existence, and nothingness enveloped %0a> all. And when nothingness rules, there is no world, nor its existence." %0a> %0a> 46. So when did this key unlock those gates, and everything became ready for %0a> the existence and evolution of the generations? When Avraham appeared, %0a> as he is the property of Hesed (mercy), of which it is written, "These are %0a> the generations of Heaven and earth Be-Hibar'am (with which He built)." %0a> However, one should pronounce the word not as Be-Hibar'am, but as %0a> Be-AvraHom (in Hebrew, these two words consist of the same letters, but in %0a> a slightly different order). Then, all that was concealed in the word BARAH %0a> was revealed as letters, meaning that the Kelim opened up to listen. And there %0a> appears the Pillar of Procreation, the sacred Yesod, upon which the world's %0a> existence is based, for the word BARAH consists of the same letters as the %0a> word AVAR (passed). %0a> %0a> He asks: "When it is revealed, can one act and produce generations?" This %0a> question includes three questions: %0a> %0a> 1. When will it be revealed? When Malchut descends from the Eynaim %0a> (where she ascended as a result of Tzimtzum Bet) to her previous %0a> place in the Peh, which leads to the revelation of the forty-nine gates %0a> of Hochma; %0a> %0a> 2. When can it be used? When Ohr Hochma clothes in Ohr Hassadim, as %0a> a result of which AHP can receive Ohr Hochma, for unless it is clothed %0a> in Ohr Hassadim, Ml = GE cannot shine within ELEH = AHP, as the %0a> Light is not yet suitable for reception and use by the lower ones; %0a> %0a> 189 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 190 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 3. What does it mean to produce, multiply generations? Generations %0a> are the souls that exist in the worlds BYA, begotten by ZA de Atzilut. %0a> After ZA receives the Lights of Hochma and Hassadim (the Light of %0a> perfection), this Light enables him to make a Zivug with Nukva and %0a> beget the souls of the righteous. %0a> %0a> WORLD OF AK %0a> %0a> WORLD OF ATZILUT: AA of the world of Atzilut %0a> AVI of the world of Atzilut %0a> %0a> ZON of the world of Atzilut produce and feed the souls of the righteous %0a> %0a> — Parsa %0a> %0a> WORLD OF BERIA %0a> %0a> WORLD OF YETZIRA the souls of the righteous in the worlds BYA %0a> WORLD ORASSIYA %0a> %0a> Machsom, the transition from egoism to altruism %0a> %0a> OUR EGOISTIC WORLD %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Avraham is the property of the Sefira Hesed in Partzuf ZA during its Gadlut (bi£ %0a> state), when Hesed ascends and becomes Hochma: Sefirot HGT become HBD: %0a> %0a> PARTZUF ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (Gevura %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hesed ) %0a> %0a> %0a> Tifferet %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Netzah J %0a> %0a> P %0a> %0a> %0a> Yesod %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> HBD {HaBaD) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> HGT (HaGaT) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> NHY(AfeffY) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVRAHAM %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 191 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Before Avraham appeared, everything was concealed in the word BARAH %0a> and nothingness ruled over the world— there was neither Ohr Hochma nor Ohr %0a> Hassadim in ZON. However, when Avraham (the Light of Hesed that descends %0a> to ZA) appeared, the gates were opened for Ohr Hochma, for Malchut descended %0a> from Eynaim to Peh, and YESHSUT merged with AVI into one degree, which %0a> led to the descent of Ohr Hochma to YESHSUT, for Ohr Hassadim of Avraham's %0a> properties was already present in ZA. %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma then clothed in Ohr Hassadim, Ml (GE) joined ELEH (AHP), %0a> the Creator's name ELO-IM was completed, and Hochma filled ZA. Then Malchut %0a> descended from Eynaim to Peh in ZA, and ZA received new AHP from Bina, %0a> thereby entering Gadlut and passing the Light through his Yesod into Malchut, %0a> called the "lower world." As a result, Malchut begets the souls of the righteous. %0a> %0a> 47. When Yesod of ZA joins the word BARAH (Malchut), there occurs a %0a> concealed and supernal division of the Creator's name and greatness, called %0a> MI, and ELEH comes into being. Also, the sacred name MA comes from %0a> BARAH. The sacred concealed ELEH exists just like Yesod. Yet, when Yesod %0a> attains its complete state, the Partzuf attains its complete state, the letter Hey %0a> corresponds to Yesod and the letter Yod— to ELEH. %0a> %0a> Here, The Zohar clarifies which Light is present in ZA, depending on his %0a> states. In the Sefira Yesod of Partzuf ZA there is an end, meaning a place of %0a> contact with Malchut, the place of the covenant between the Creator (ZA) and %0a> the Shechina (the souls of the righteous), also called "Israel" or Malchut. This %0a> place of contact is called Ateret Yesod (encirclement of Yesod) or Keter de ZA (the %0a> crown of ZA). %0a> %0a> The word BARAH signifies Katnut (small state), which comes as a result %0a> of Malchut's ascent to NE. AVI never abandon the properties of GAR de Bina %0a> (properties of mercy); they do not desire to receive. Having ascended and %0a> standing in them, Malchut is called Man'ula (lock), which prevents the Light from %0a> spreading below her. Ateret Yesod de ZA is called Miftacha (key), for it is through %0a> its property that the Light can be received in the Partzufim located below AVI. %0a> %0a> This is possible on condition that ELEH = AHP ascend to MI = GE. Ohr %0a> Hochma can be received in the Kelim ELEH that wish to receive it, but only upon %0a> their ascension above Parsa. However, until the properties of Malchut acquire %0a> the property of Bina, until they are "softened" by this property, there is no way %0a> to receive the Light, and Malchut is called "the 50 th gate." %0a> %0a> Hence, we see that the words MI BARAH ELEH signify not the question, %0a> "Who created these?" but the action: MI = GE BARAH (created) ELEH = AHP by %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 192 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the descent of Malchut from NE back to Peh. As a result, ELEH = AHP ascended %0a> to the Rosh and there received the Light of GAR (Hochma). %0a> %0a> Upon descending to Peh, Malchut is called MA, as that is the name of the %0a> lower world. Her screen in the Peh makes a Zivug, onto which descends Ohr %0a> Hassadim, called "Light of blessing," for it abolishes the prohibition and the lock %0a> imposed on the diffusion of Light. %0a> %0a> 48. When the letters Hey and Yod wished to complement one another, the %0a> letter Mem emerged from them, and the word ELO-HIM = ELE + Hey + %0a> Yod + Mem was formed by the union of both sides. The word AVAR + Hey %0a> + Mem = Avraham originated from ELEH. However, one might say that the %0a> Creator took the words ELEH and MI, joined them and formed the word %0a> ELOKIM, whereas the words MA and AVAR formed the word Avraham, %0a> where the word MI designates the fifty gates of Bina, and the word MA refers %0a> to the numerical value of the holy name, for HaVaYaH with the filling of the %0a> letter Aleph forms the Qematria of MA— 45. %0a> %0a> Both this world and the world to come exist in these two letters, Yod and %0a> Hey. This world is in Yod, and the world to come is in Hey. Hence, the world to %0a> come was created with MI, and this world with MA. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written: "These are the created (Be-Hibar'am) generations %0a> of Heaven and earth," where the letters Be-Hibar'am make up the word %0a> "Avraham," for there was no perfection until the letters formed this word. %0a> Therefore, the Creator's name HaVaYaH is first mentioned in the Torah only %0a> after the name Avraham. %0a> %0a> Ohr Hassadim in MA and Ohr Hochma in ELEH wished to complement one %0a> another and be complemented within one another. As a result, Ohr Hochma %0a> clothed in Ohr Hassadim, and Malchut receives from both Hassadim and Hochma. %0a> In so doing, MA and MI join and create MM, i.e., Malchut that receives Ohr %0a> Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim from Above. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 49. Rabbi Chiya prostrated himself on the ground and kissed it. He wept and %0a> said: "Dust, how hard and heartless you are, how many you have consumed, %0a> all the pillars of Light and all the great souls were consumed by you. And %0a> the greatest of all, Rabbi Shimon, the Light of the entire world, of all the %0a> worlds, who illuminates and governs over the descending Light, upon which %0a> our world exists, is also consumed by you, and yet you govern the world?" But %0a> then he collected himself at once and said: "Do not be proud, dust, for the %0a> pillars of the world will not be betrayed to you, and Rabbi Shimon will not be %0a> consumed by you!" %0a> %0a> Malchut is the sole creation. And this sole creation is nothing but a desire %0a> to receive pleasure. It was made this way, and its essence cannot be changed. %0a> Yet, what can be changed is the intention— for which or whose sake to receive %0a> the pleasure. %0a> %0a> As a result of Malchut's union with Bina with an altruistic will to bestow %0a> delight, give pleasure, Malchut acquires Bina 's desire in addition to her own. That %0a> is, an additional desire appears in Malchut— to bestow, opposite to her nature. %0a> %0a> Only this desire of Bina in Malchut can result in a Zivug and reception of %0a> Light. When Malchut receives all the desires that she possibly can from Bina, %0a> and fills them with Light, only her own initial egoistic property will remain %0a> uncorrected, but even that will be corrected from Above by the Creator Himself. %0a> The order of correction and reception of Light in Bina s properties inside of %0a> Malchut is referred to as the reception on the Zivug of Yesod, and it takes place %0a> sequentially along 6,000 degrees, called "6,000 years." %0a> %0a> Malchut de Malchut of the world of At^ilut cannot receive any Light during the %0a> 6,000 years until all of its parts are completely corrected. All the Zivugim (plural %0a> for Zivug) throughout the 6,000 years are made not on Malchut herself, but on %0a> the properties she received from Bina. The place of such a Zivug is called Yesod %0a> %0a> 193 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 194 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> de Malchut or Ateret Yesod. Whereas Malchut herself (egoistic desires) remains %0a> closed to the Light, and is therefore called the "closed gates." %0a> %0a> The reception of Light during the 6,000 years, correction of the Partzufim, %0a> and the gradual filling of Malchut with the Light, takes place with the help of %0a> Bina's desires in Malchut, which are called Miftacha (Yesod de Malchut), for the %0a> impure (egoistic) force has no power over this part of Malchut. %0a> %0a> Yesod de Malchut means that Malchut only acts with the properties she received %0a> from a Higher Sefira— Yesod, which is free from the influence of the impure forces %0a> (Klipot). All the properties, except for those of Malchut, are altruistic, since they %0a> originate from Bina. However, since we wish to emphasize that a Zivug is made %0a> on an altruistic desire, above the egoistic desire of Malchut, we usually say Yesod %0a> instead of Bina. And since Yesod is the Sefira immediately above Malchut, we say %0a> that a Zivug is made not on the egoistic desires of Malchut, but on Yesod. And %0a> since, upon acquiring the properties of Yesod, Malchut can receive the Light, %0a> such reception of Light on Yesod de Malchut is called "Miftacha" (from the word %0a> Mafte'ach, key)— the key that opens the way for the Upper Light. %0a> %0a> However, since Malchut herself, that is, Malchut de Malchut ("closed gates") %0a> remains inaccessible to the Light for 6,000 years, Rabbi Chiya (a particular %0a> spiritual degree) could not understand how Rabbi Shimon (the spiritual %0a> Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon) could achieve such complete perfection. Indeed, %0a> Rabbi Shimon is a Partzuf of such spiritual height that it receives the Light of %0a> Yechida. And it is impossible to receive this Light without utilizing a Zivug on %0a> Malchut de Malchut itself. %0a> %0a> And yet, this part of Malchut remains uncorrected until the completion of %0a> the 6,000 years (the end of correction), and thus cannot be used. By defying %0a> these desires, it is as though one has already partially corrected it. And all the %0a> prohibitory commandments refer to Malchut de Malchut; hence, the ban imposed %0a> on its use is called "a restriction." %0a> %0a> Yet, if it is impossible to fill the "stony heart" (Lev HaEven), i.e., Malchut %0a> de Malchut (the root of egoism, the basis of creation), with Light, how can %0a> even a single soul achieve complete correction? After all, complete correction %0a> implies the reception of Light in the entire Malchut. Each soul, each part of %0a> Malchut that man is destined to correct contains a part of all the other parts of %0a> Malchut, including a part of Malchut de Malchut, which he may not work with %0a> until the end of correction. %0a> %0a> On the other hand, Rabbi Chiya sees Rabbi Shimon in a state of %0a> complete correction. So how could the latter have attained such state? This %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 195 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> contradiction roused Rabbi Chiya so greatly that he prostrated himself on the %0a> ground and cried out. %0a> %0a> It is impossible to constantly "translate" the words of the Torah or The %0a> Zohar into a language we can understand, that "ground" signifies egoism and %0a> "dust" refers to the impure forces, that "crying out" implies raising MAN, and so %0a> forth. All the words and definitions in the text of The Zohar should be perceived %0a> ;nsuously rather than literally, as physical actions of our world. In other words, %0a> sver The Zohar speaks of is related only to inner, spiritual sensations anc %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> All the worlds constitute the "environment," the spiritual sphere, within %0a> which the Creator made His only creation— man (Adam). Everything else was %0a> created only in order to help man to achieve his spiritual mission of becoming %0a> like his Creator. %0a> %0a> Just as in our world, the world itself and all its inhabitants, except man, are %0a> aerated by their animal nature, rather than creatures with free will, in %0a> lal worlds, all the spiritual beings, except for the soul, are operated by %0a> leir spiritual nature. Upon being born in our world, man, too, is an animal %0a> without freedom to act against his egoistic desire to receive pleasure. He usually %0a> stays that way throughout his existence on earth, being not at all different from %0a> le still, vegetative, and animate levels of nature, automatically following orders %0a> ler master, egoism. %0a> %0a> with the help of Kabbalah can one gradually receive Upper, spiritual %0a> strength, and consequently acquire freedom of choice, that is, liberate himself from %0a> the influence of the impure, egoistic forces, and become free in his desires, like the %0a> Creator. However, such an opportunity is only given to one who can control his %0a> automatically-driven, egoistic nature: according to the strength of his screen, man %0a> ascends (moves inwardly, in his sensations) from this world to the spiritual. %0a> %0a> After creating the spiritual worlds as a home for his future creation, the %0a> Creator created the creature (soul, Adam). The soul constitutes the desire to %0a> delight in the sensation of the Creator, of His Light. The sensation of the %0a> Creator is called "Light." There is nothing else in the entire universe besides %0a> the Light and the soul! %0a> %0a> Although the soul itself is Malchut de Malchut (the only egoistic creation), %0a> the Creator imparted onto it the property of altruism, having created it mixed %0a> with the Kelim (desires) of Bina, thereby demonstrating how wonderful it would %0a> be to be like Him. %0a> %0a> While performing altruistic actions, the soul (Adam) decided to use its %0a> natural egoism, Malchut de Malchut itself, to receive the Creator's Light with %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 196 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> altruistic intentions. Yet, when it began to let the tremendous Light of Yechida %0a> into Malchut de Malchut, it could not resist and wished to enjoy it egoistically. %0a> This change in the soul's desires is referred to as its fall. %0a> %0a> As a result of the fall, Adam's soul split into myriad parts (600,000), all of %0a> which fell into captivity of impure, egoistic forces (acquired egoistic desires). %0a> After the fall, Adam corrected some of the souls (obtained an anti-egoistic %0a> screen), but only partially. And then, of the total number of souls, some were %0a> selected for correction, lowered into this world, and clothed into bodies, %0a> generation after generation. %0a> %0a> The descent (distancing from the Creator) into our world (egoistic %0a> sensations of only one's own desires) occurs as a result of attaching an additional %0a> "makeweight" of egoism to the soul. In the spiritual world, movement (farther %0a> from the Creator or closer to Him) and distance (from Him) are determined by %0a> the correlation of egoistic and altruistic desires within the soul. %0a> %0a> The purpose behind the souls' descent to our world is to transform one's %0a> egoistic desires with the help of Kabbalah, and to return to the Creator with %0a> one's intentions, by performing altruistic actions. The souls' descent continues %0a> until each of them and all of them together achieve complete correction. %0a> %0a> And the most exalted souls that refer to the degrees of Yechida and GAR %0a> of Haya depend on the correction of Malchut herself in Malchut of the world %0a> of Atzilut ("closed gates"). These will only be corrected at the completion of %0a> the 6,000 years, after the correction of all the rest. This is due to the inverse %0a> relationship between the souls and the Light that fills them: the more egoistic %0a> the soul is, and the lower it is located, the greater the Light that enters the %0a> general Partzuf (the common soul) at the time of its correction. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE LIGHT OF SOULS %0a> %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya %0a> %0a> %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> MALCHUT (types of souls) %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This is why these exalted souls are consumed by dust (impure force), i.e., %0a> the impure force rules over them with its enormous and insolent power, for it is %0a> certain that no one and nothing can save these souls from captivity. %0a> %0a> This is why Rabbi Chiya wept: "Dust, how cruel you are!" That the most %0a> exalted souls are "consumed by you without any hope of escaping you!" In other %0a> words, the actual root of creation, the primordial egoism cannot be corrected. %0a> %0a> It turns out that as a result of the exalted souls' captivity by the rule of %0a> the impure forces, all the righteous that bring Light to the entire world cannot %0a> achieve perfection themselves. Since all the souls are interconnected, not a %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 197 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> single individual soul can arrive at the end of correction until all the souls are %0a> corrected. This is why they are susceptible to the ruthless rule of the dust. %0a> %0a> At first, Rabbi Chiya wanted to say that Rabbi Shimon himself was also %0a> consumed by dust, i.e., did not achieve complete correction. He had heard that %0a> Rabbi Yosi also reasons that the closed gates are closed for all. Yet, after some %0a> contemplation, he inquired: "If Rabbi Shimon revives all the worlds and governs %0a> them, how can it possibly be that he has not reached perfection?" %0a> %0a> Therefore, he concludes that Rabbi Shimon was not consumed by the %0a> dust, that he did achieve complete correction and is probably in a state of %0a> absolute perfection. The thing that Rabbi Chiya could not understand, how- %0a> ever, is how any individual soul could achieve the end of correction prior to %0a> (without) the complete correction of all the others. This, Rabbi Chiya could %0a> not explain to himself. %0a> %0a> 50. Rabbi Chiya stood up and started to walk and weep. Rabbi Yosi joined %0a> him. He fasted for forty days so that he might see Rabbi Shimon. He was %0a> told he still was not worthy of seeing him. He wept and fasted for another %0a> forty days. He was then shown a vision: Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi %0a> Elazar were discussing him, Rabbi Chiya, the words he said to Rabbi Yosi, and %0a> thousands are listening in on their discussion. %0a> %0a> Although the fasting that The Zohar speaks of is a spiritual act, in our world %0a> such a description is a good example of how strong a desire should be in order %0a> to be answered from Above. Other spiritual actions include weeping, tears— %0a> the small state (Katnut) of a spiritual Partzuf, in this case referred to as "Rabbi %0a> Chiya." Naturally, Rabbi Shimon and all the other characters of The Zohar are %0a> spiritual Partzufim, rather than people of our world. %0a> %0a> Truth be told, the spiritual level of a person known by a certain name in %0a> our world may coincide with his spiritual root described in the Torah. However, %0a> elucidation of this matter exceeds the scope of this particular article. It is %0a> nonetheless essential to note that Pharaoh in the corporeal Egypt, naturally, %0a> was not a spiritual Pharaoh, the way he is described in The Zohar (the Partzuf that %0a> includes all of Malchut), and Laban, portrayed in the Torah as a villain, is in fact %0a> the Supernal Spiritual Light of Partzuf AB, the Supernal Light of Hochma. This %0a> will be explained later on. %0a> %0a> The strong desire to attain the degree of Rabbi Shimon allowed Rabbi Chiya %0a> to see him, for he was certain that Rabbi Shimon had not been consumed by %0a> the dust. He came to this conclusion precisely because of his conversation with %0a> Rabbi Yosi, and hence passionately desired to see Rabbi Shimon. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 198 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 51. In that same vision, Rabbi Chiya saw several great celestial wings: how %0a> Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi Elazar mounted them and soared to the %0a> Assembly of Heaven, while the wings waited for them. Afterwards, they both %0a> returned to their place and shone brighter than ever before, brighter than the %0a> light of the sun. %0a> %0a> The Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of the angel Matatron. %0a> However, his full name is not pronounced, and the name Matat is used instead, %0a> for pronouncing a name is equivalent to an action, which is not always desirable. %0a> The term Supernal Assembly refers to the Assembly of the Creator Himself, %0a> while the Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of Matat. %0a> %0a> The wings that were waiting for Rabbi Shimon and his son Elazar are angels %0a> (spiritual forces, similar to robots or draft animals in our world), whose task is to %0a> help the souls to ascend from one spiritual degree to another. And just as these %0a> wings must assist the souls in their ascent, they must assist them to descend to %0a> their places. Therefore, it is said that the wings were waiting for Rabbi Shimon %0a> and his son Rabbi Elazar to bring them back down. %0a> %0a> And when Rabbi Chiya saw them returning from the Heavenly Assembly %0a> back to their place (to Rabbi Shimon's Assembly), he noticed a new light on %0a> their faces, and radiance surrounded them that was brighter than the sun. %0a> %0a> 52. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "Let Rabbi Chiya enter and see how much %0a> the Creator renews the faces of the righteous in the world to come. Happy is %0a> he who comes here without shame. Happy is he who stands in the other world %0a> as a rigid pillar opposite all." And Rabbi Chiya saw himself entering, and %0a> Rabbi Elazar and all the other pillars of the world that were there stood up %0a> before Rabbi Chiya. And he, Rabbi Chiya, was ashamed; he entered, bending, %0a> and sat at the feet of Rabbi Shimon. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon opened (opened the way for the Light) and said: "Happy is he %0a> who enters without shame." And all that were present there felt no shame. Only %0a> Rabbi Chiya was ashamed. This is because they had the strength to withstand the %0a> power of the dust, and Rabbi Chiya did not. They were all perfect, whereas Rabbi %0a> Chiya had a flaw— the desire to attain. And this is what he was ashamed of. %0a> %0a> 53. A voice sounded: "Lower your eyes, do not raise your head, and do not %0a> look." He lowered his eyes and saw Light that shone from afar. The voice %0a> returned and said: "The Supernal Ones, concealed and enclosed, who have %0a> eyes that watch over the entire world, look and see: the lower ones are sleeping, %0a> and the Light of their eyes is concealed in their pupils. Wake them!" %0a> %0a> After he followed the instruction to lower his eyes and not raise his head (not %0a> use his desire to receive Light, but only desires to bestow), he merited hearing %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 199 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (Light of Hassadim) the appeal, with the help of which he attained everything %0a> he wished. The voice divides all souls into two groups: the first is a group of %0a> Supernal Holy Ones that are concealed, who merited their eyes to be opened to %0a> behold the entire world, and the second group of souls have the Light of their %0a> eyes concealed in their eye-sockets, which is what blinded them. This is why the %0a> voice called upon the souls of the first group to behold, i.e., to use the reception %0a> of the Upper Light, to draw the Upper Light together with the second group. %0a> %0a> 54. Who among you turns darkness into Light and savors bitter as sweet even %0a> before he came here, that is, while still living in the other world? Who among %0a> you hopes and waits each day for the Light that shines when the Lord distances, %0a> when His greatness grows and He is called the King of all kings of the world? %0a> For he who does not wait for this each day while living in this world, has no %0a> place in the other world either. %0a> %0a> The Creator's goal is for man to fully attain Him while still living in this %0a> world, to feel Him as he did prior to descending into this world, prior to %0a> incarnating in a physical body. From this the division of people of our world %0a> into two groups is clearly evident, and the voice appeals to them. %0a> %0a> The voice emphasizes to each group their main advantage. To the souls %0a> of the first group, it says that they turned darkness into Light. These are the %0a> souls of the world of Atzilut, for the Creator created two opposite systems in the %0a> worlds BYA: the system of darkness and bitterness opposite the system of Light %0a> and sweetness. Therefore, in the Torah of the worlds BYA there is a division into %0a> suitable and unsuitable, pure and impure, permitted and forbidden, holy and %0a> unholy, whereas the Torah of the world of Atzilut, which consists wholly of the %0a> Creator's names, contains nothing impure whatsoever. %0a> %0a> And the sinner Laban is regarded as a holy name in the world of Atzilut, %0a> as well as the Pharaoh. And all the names that represent impure forces in the %0a> worlds BYA become corrected in the world of Atzilut, exalted and pure spiritual %0a> objects and forces with corresponding holy names. Therefore, the souls that %0a> have attained the Light of the world of Atzilut transform all darkness into Light %0a> and all bitterness into sweetness. In other words, the whole difference between %0a> the holy, pure, and good, and their opposites lies in the correction of the desire %0a> and in acquiring an anti-egoistic screen over the will to receive. %0a> %0a> And to the second group the voice said that they're waiting for the Creator's %0a> help, and He will rise (Shechina, His manifestation to the lower ones) from the %0a> dust (in their sensations). But those who do not wait for Him, being preoccupied %0a> with other aspirations, will not rise from the dust, and the sensation of the %0a> Creator will remain concealed from them. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 200 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 55. In his vision, Rabbi Chiya saw many of his friends gathering around the %0a> standing pillars. And he saw them being elevated to the Heavenly Assembly, %0a> some are elevated, while others are lowered. And above them all, he saw Matat, %0a> the owner of wings, approaching. %0a> %0a> As the voice was calling, Rabbi Chiya saw several souls of the righteous, %0a> belonging to the two groups, standing around the two pillars that were already %0a> present in Rabbi Shimon's assembly, and whom he had already seen ascending %0a> to the Heavenly Assembly. Some were ascending, and some were descending; %0a> moreover, this motion ensued in mutually opposite directions. %0a> %0a> This way the two groups help one another according to the calling voice, %0a> which instructs the first group to descend and the second to ascend. Rabbi Chiya %0a> saw also that due to the excitement of all these souls over their aspirations, i.e., %0a> the power of the two groups, Matat descended from the Heavenly Assembly to %0a> the assembly of Rabbi Shimon and swore an oath. %0a> %0a> 56. The angel Matat swore that he heard from behind the curtain how each %0a> day the Creator remembers and grieves over Malchut, cast into the dust. And %0a> when He remembers her, He strikes 390 firmaments, and they all tremble %0a> with terrible fear before Him. And the Creator sheds tears for the Shechina %0a> (Divinity), Malchut that has fallen to the dust. And those tears simmer like %0a> fire, and fall into the Great Sea. And by the power of these tears, the Ruler of %0a> the Sea, called Rachav, is revived, blesses the Creator's holy name, and vows to %0a> swallow up everything, from the first days of creation, and to absorb all within %0a> himself, when all the nations gather against the holy nation, and the waters %0a> will dry, and Israel will walk through dry land. %0a> %0a> This vow signifies that the Creator never forgets, but remembers each day that %0a> the Shechina lies in the dust. However, this does not refer to the entire Holy Shechina: %0a> this, the Creator need not vow, for it is revealed and seen by all who dwell in the %0a> Upper Worlds that everything He does is for the Shechina (Malchut) alone. %0a> %0a> But this refers only to Malchut de Malchut. She is the one Rabbi Chiya thinks %0a> about being held captive by the impure forces, completely abandoned. Hence, %0a> he wept: "Oh dust that consumes all!" And here, the angel Matat, who has come %0a> to the Assembly of Rabbi Shimon, revealed to Rabbi Chiya a great secret— that %0a> the Creator's rule is absolute, and He remembers Malchut de Malchut each day. %0a> %0a> A Zivug (union of the Masach-screen and the Light-pleasure) is defined as %0a> a stroke of Light onto the screen, a result of the desire to enter and cross the %0a> screen's barrier, while the screen restricts and repels it. This act of repelling is %0a> called the Returning (reversed) Light, as it rises from the screen from below %0a> upwards and clothes the coming Light. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 201 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This may be compared to the example of the host (Creator) offering delicious %0a> food (Light) to his guest (Kli), who wishes to enjoy the delicacies. However, as %0a> a result of the shame from being the receiver, the guest refuses to receive, and %0a> the screen repels the food (Light). It is as though the guest (Kli) says to the host %0a> (Creator) that he refuses to receive the pleasure (Light) for himself, for his own %0a> enjoyment. This repelling of the food (Light) forms the Returning Light, for it %0a> stems not just from not wanting to feel shame, as it is in our world, but from the %0a> spiritual Kli's desire to be like the Creator. %0a> %0a> The Returning Light is that altruistic intention, desire. This is also the %0a> spiritual Kli, and only within it can the Light be received; only in this intention %0a> can one feel the Creator. %0a> %0a> After the Kli was able to repel all the pleasure coming to it, and demonstrated %0a> that it could meet the condition of the first restriction (to refrain from egoistic %0a> reception), it began to calculate how much Light it could receive for the Creator's %0a> sake. The Kli receives only the amount of pleasure that it is certain it can receive %0a> for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> The delight that was received inside the Kli is referred to as the Inner Light. %0a> The amount of Light received inside the vessel determines the degree of similarity %0a> to the Creator; the Kli acts like the Creator: just as He desires to bestow pleasure %0a> upon the Kli, so the Kli wishes to bestow upon Him, to the extent of the Inner %0a> Light received. Therefore, the size of the Kli, (from Peh to Tabur, where it receives %0a> the Light) determines the degree of merging with the Creator. In this place, the %0a> Kli is merged with Him in properties and intentions. %0a> %0a> If the Kli's powers of resistance are not sufficient to receive for the Creator's %0a> sake, and it can only refrain from reception, the Kli is considered to be in the %0a> "small" state, Katnut. The Kli that was created by the Creator is the strongest. %0a> However, afterwards, as it begins to descend, its screen gradually weakens until %0a> the Kli can no longer receive for the Creator's sake. It is left with just enough %0a> strength to not receive for itself. This is why from this state onward there is a ban %0a> on reception of Light into the Kli's desires "to receive." The Kli may only use its %0a> GE, but not its AHP. And the boundary beyond which the Light cannot spread %0a> is called Parsa, the firmament. This barrier is built from Above; thus, even if the %0a> Kli suddenly wishes to receive the Light for itself, it will not be able to do so. %0a> %0a> The screen divides the firmament and consists of four parts: Hochma, Bina, %0a> Tifferet, and Malchut (HBTM), the four letters of HaVaYaH. Because Malchut %0a> joined with Bina and thereby corrected her egoistic properties into altruistic %0a> ones, the screen is located not in Malchut, but in Bina. Bina is counted as %0a> hundreds; therefore, the four parts HBTM equal 400. However, there is no Zivug %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 202 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (reception of Light) on Malchut de Malchut itself (after all, it is called the "closed %0a> gates"). This means that Malchut contains ninety Sefirot, and not 100: 9 Sefirot, %0a> each consisting of ten. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the screen that is called "the firmament" and that makes a Zivug %0a> with the Upper Light by reflecting it consists of 390 parts, for the part of Malchut de %0a> Malchut is lacking. The firmament is therefore said to consist of 390 firmaments, %0a> and on it a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made, whereas a Zivug on the dust, %0a> which signifies the ten parts of Malchut de Malchut, is forbidden. The impact %0a> between the screen and the incoming Light resembles shuddering from fear to %0a> receive the Light inside of oneself, beyond the limits of one's restrictions. %0a> %0a> There are five Sefirot in the Rosh (head) of a Partzuf: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> - Galgalta (or Metzach) %0a> %0a> %0a> - forehead %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> - Eynaim %0a> %0a> %0a> - eyes %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> - Awznayim %0a> %0a> %0a> - ears %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> - Hotem %0a> %0a> %0a> - nose %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> - Peh %0a> %0a> %0a> - mouth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Just as the secretion from one's physiological eyes is called tears, the secretion %0a> of the Light of Hochma from the part of the spiritual Kli called "eyes" is referred %0a> to as "tears." Tears constitute the part of the Light that is rejected by the Partzuf %0a> due to the absence of a screen on Malchut de Malchut. All the Light that comes to %0a> a Partzuf wishes to enter and fill it with its pleasure, even the part of the Partzuf %0a> that has no screen to receive with altruistic intentions. Therefore, the screen %0a> immediately repels this portion of the Light. %0a> %0a> But between the strike of the Light from Above and the resistance of the %0a> screen from below, tiny drops of Light seep through the screen, which, due to its %0a> hurry, is unable to repel them. These drops have nothing to do with the level of %0a> Hochma of the Partzuf, as they lack the clothing of the Returning Light. They exit %0a> the Partzuf Hochma and receive the name "tears." But it is nonetheless Light! %0a> %0a> This is similar to a state where we are filled with tears of compassion for %0a> another person. Indeed, all that exists in our world exists because it derives %0a> from its spiritual prototype, and all that transpires in this world, transpires only %0a> because it stems from its Upper, spiritual root. %0a> %0a> After all, the fact that the Upper Light strikes the screen, trying to break %0a> through its restriction, stems from its origin in the Highest Place, the Creator %0a> Himself, and is unrelated to the creature's desire to receive this Light within %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 203 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the bounds of its altruistic capabilities. The Light stems from the world of %0a> Infinity, from the Creator Himself, long before the Kli appeared and wished %0a> to restrict itself. %0a> %0a> The Upper Light wishes to fill the desire to enjoy that it created, as it is said, %0a> "the Creator wishes to dwell in His creatures below." The Light and the Creator %0a> are one and the same; after all, man defines the sensation of the Creator as %0a> spiritual Light. And this Upper Light strives to force its way through the screen %0a> and enter man's desires, but the screen hurls it back. Thus, this repelled Upper %0a> Light becomes Returning Light, which designates man's altruistic intentions to %0a> bestow delight upon the Creator. %0a> %0a> As a result of the collision with the screen, portions of the Light fall %0a> outside, for these tears originate from the Creator's love and compassion for %0a> His creation. In our world, this spiritual action results in an emission of tears %0a> in an individual overwhelmed with suffering and love. However, spiritual tears %0a> do not disappear. %0a> %0a> This is described in Song of Songs (8:6): "For love is as strong as death, %0a> jealousy is as cruel as hell; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, the very flame %0a> of the Lord!" This is because these tears stem from the Upper One's love and %0a> compassion for the lower one. And just as flaming tears shed by someone in our %0a> world burn, so do the boiling and burning Upper tears burn like fire, like the %0a> very flame of the Lord! %0a> %0a> Being related to the property of Hochma, Malchut is called "sea." It is %0a> therefore said that the tears (Light of Hochma without first being clothed in %0a> Light of Hassadim) fall into the sea, Malchut. And it is written that the many %0a> sea waters will not extinguish the Creator's love for His creatures, expressed %0a> in these tears. %0a> %0a> It was said during the creation of the world: "Let the waters be gathered %0a> together unto one place" (Beresheet, 1:9). But the angel that governed the sea did %0a> not wish to swallow these waters, and was hence killed (was emptied of Light). %0a> Now, as the tears fall, he is revived. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that during the creation of the world, Malchut de %0a> Malchut itself had not undergone any kind of correction, as the Creator created %0a> the worlds ABYA in a special correction, called MAN de Bina or Ateret Yesod, %0a> and not MAN de Malchut or Malchut de Malchut. In other words, correction is %0a> possible only if man corrects not Malchut de Malchut itself (his essence), but, %0a> while completely refraining from its use (use of egoism), he acquires higher, %0a> altruistic desires from Bina and receives the Creator's Light in them (in Sefirot %0a> KHB-ZA de Malchut, in 390 Sefirot). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 204 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> These higher, altruistic desires are referred to as desires of Bina or as MAN %0a> de Bina, and the reception of Light in them (Zivug) is made not on egoism %0a> (Malchut herself), but on the will to bestow, called Ateret Yesod. This Zivug is %0a> therefore sufficient to fill only the first nine Sefirot in Malchut, but does not %0a> fill Malchut herself. %0a> %0a> Prophet Yeshayahu (Isaiah) writes in this regard: "Who are you with, %0a> partners? I started the worlds, and you are to complete them!" The correction of %0a> Malchut de Malchut is incumbent solely upon the creatures. Hence, when the sea %0a> ruler was told: "Let the waters be gathered together unto one place," he objected %0a> and did not wish to swallow up the created waters, for due to the uncorrected %0a> state of Malchut de Malchut, the impure forces prevailed and ruled over him. %0a> And that is why he was killed. %0a> %0a> However, these tears correct Malchut de Malchut, and thus revive the sea %0a> ruler so that he would rise from the dead, sanctify the name of the Lord, fulfill %0a> the Creator's will, and swallow up the primeval waters. For then, all the impure %0a> forces, all the evil in the world will disappear and all (desires) will gather in one %0a> place (property), whose name is Atzilut. This is because the world of Atxilut will %0a> spread from the end of the world of AK down to our world, and there will come %0a> the end of correction, for the worlds of BYA will return in their properties to %0a> the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> In the future, at the end of correction, after the correction of the first nine %0a> Sefirot of Malchut, when only Malchut de Malchut, the last, tenth Sefira, remains %0a> to be corrected, when all the nations of the world (Malchut de Malchut) unite to %0a> destroy Israel (the first nine Sefirot of Malchut, the desire to correct all the ten %0a> Sefirot of Malchut), the act of the sea ruler will be revealed in that he will swallow %0a> up all the primeval, evil waters, and the waters (severe restrictions) will dry up, and %0a> the sons of Israel (those who aspire for the Creator) will walk through dry land. %0a> %0a> The prophet Micha (Micah) says of this: "As we fled the land of Egypt, we %0a> saw wonders." However, this was only the beginning, for it was only in the End %0a> Sea (the Red Sea; the Hebrew name signifies the end of Malchut, or Malchut de %0a> Malchut), and only for a limited time. But, at the end of correction, death will %0a> disappear forever. %0a> %0a> This is how Matat explained his oath: the Creator never forgets Malchut, %0a> which is cast in the dust. For even though a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made %0a> on only 390 firmaments, on the nine Sefirot of Malchut and not on Malchut de %0a> Malchut itself, which remains lying in the dust, and, as it seems to us, completely %0a> forgotten by the Creator, nothing could be further from the truth. In truth, %0a> He corrects it with each Zivug, because with each Zivug, as a result of the 390 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 205 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> firmaments being struck, the tears fall outside. And these tears are not lost, but %0a> fall into the Great Sea (Malchut de Malchut), which receives from them slow, yet %0a> gradual corrections, even if it is the Light of Hochma without the clothing of %0a> the Light of Hassadim. As it becomes more and more corrected, the sea ruler is %0a> revived until the tears accumulate to the necessary amount for the correction of %0a> the entire Malchut, so that all of her intentions would be for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> This will occur when all the nations of the world unite to attack Israel. Then, %0a> the sea ruler will rise back to life and swallow up all the primeval waters, for %0a> Malchut de Malchut will receive the lacking correction, for each day the Creator %0a> cares for her until she, His only creation, reaches her final correction. %0a> %0a> And here Rabbi Chiya's delusion was revealed to him: he understood that %0a> nothing disappears in the dust, but, on the contrary, each day Malchut undergoes %0a> corrections, just as Matat swore. %0a> %0a> 57. Through all this, he heard a voice: "Clear this place, clear this place! The %0a> Mashiach (Messiah), the King-Redeemer is coming to the assembly of Rabbi %0a> Shimon," for all the righteous gathered there are the heads of groups and %0a> assemblies, whereas all of the assembly members ascend from this assembly %0a> to the Assembly of Heaven. And the Mashiach visits all these assemblies and %0a> seals the Torah that stems from the mouths of the righteous. And at that %0a> moment, the M.ashiach comes to the assembly of Rabbi Shimon, surrounded %0a> by the heads of all the Supernal assemblies. %0a> %0a> As a result of the great revelation— the end of correction— concealed in the %0a> oath of Matat, all of the righteous present at Rabbi Shimon's Assembly were %0a> elevated, especially the two groups of the righteous that caused Matat to appear %0a> and take his oath. As a result, all of them attained Upper Degrees and reached %0a> the levels of "heads of assemblies," for each assembly has members and a head, %0a> and the difference between them is similar to the difference between VAK, GE %0a> of the degree or Partzuf, from GAR, the complete Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written that the place should be cleared for the Mashiach. After %0a> all, when Matat revealed the secret of the end (of correction), and specifically %0a> how creation will be delivered from egoism, a voice appeared and commanded %0a> to prepare a place for the Mashiach, the King-Redeemer, for the end of correction %0a> is connected to the King-Mas hiach. %0a> %0a> However, only the righteous of Rabbi Shimon's assembly, who are above all %0a> the heads of assemblies, merit his coming, for only those who are on the same %0a> spiritual level as the King-Mashiach (all those who have already corrected all of %0a> their other properties— the first nine Sefirot in their part of desires-Malchut— all %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 206 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of the properties except for the original egoism, Malchut de Malchut) can merit %0a> the revelation of his face. %0a> %0a> The level of the Mashiach is the Light of Yechida. And if all the members had %0a> not reached the level of the heads of the assemblies, the GAR of the degrees, %0a> i.e., corrected all that they could, they would not have merited the revelation %0a> of the Mashiach's face. But the heads of the Assemblies are not GAR of the low %0a> degrees. Rather, they represent a level so high that all the members have merited %0a> reaching the Heavenly Assembly of Matat. %0a> %0a> And now all the members merited becoming the heads of the Assemblies, %0a> wherefrom they merited an ascent to the Heavenly Assembly. Moreover, %0a> thanks to their corrections, they merited the Mashiach himself coming to all %0a> these assemblies to be adorned with their deeds in the Torah. And now all the %0a> members have merited reaching the level of the assemblies' heads. This is why %0a> the Mashiach is adorned with the Torah of the assemblies' heads. Thus, thanks %0a> to them, the Mashiach himself ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a> %0a> 58. At that time, all the members stood up. Rabbi Shimon stood up, too, and %0a> his Light rose to the firmament. The Mashiach said unto him: "Happy are %0a> you, Rabbi, for your Torah has risen in 370 beams of Light, and each beam %0a> divides into 613 beams (properties) that ascend and bathe in the rivers of %0a> the holy Apharsemon (persimmon). And the Creator confirms and signs the %0a> Torah of your assembly, of the assembly of Chizkiyah (Hezekiah), the King of %0a> Judah, and the assembly of Achiyah ha Shiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite)." %0a> %0a> When the Mashiach revealed himself to them and came to Rabbi Shimon's %0a> Assembly, all the members stood up (ascended from the level of VAK to GAR), %0a> and Rabbi Shimon stood on the same degree as the Mashiach. And the Light rose %0a> to the height of the firmament. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon has attained %0a> the Light of the ten firmaments, the previously missing tenth firmament on %0a> account of the closed gates of Malchut de Malchut, and has attained the Light of %0a> Yechida, which he now was able to receive, as he could make a Zivug on Malchut de %0a> Malchut. And the Light of Yechida that shines from this Zivug is called Mashiach. %0a> The "sitting" level is 390, or VAK; the "standing" level is 400, or GAR. %0a> %0a> The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that his Torah gave rise to the Light of %0a> Yechida in Partzuf Atik, because: %0a> %0a> Units (0 - 9) are in Malchut; %0a> Tens (10 - 90) are in ZA; %0a> Hundreds (100 - 900) are in Ima; %0a> Thousands (1,000 - 9,000) are in Aba; %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 207 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Tens of thousands (10,000 - 90,000) are in Arich Anpin; %0a> And hundreds of thousands (100,000 - 900,000) are in Atik. %0a> %0a> Since each Sefira of Atik equals 100,000, the four Sefirot of HaVaYaH (HBTM %0a> of Atik) total 400,000. %0a> %0a> However, in this case, he should have said that the Torah performed the %0a> deed in 400,000; yet, he said that the Light emanated by Ima is not used on %0a> 400, but only on 370, for although the Torah had reached the zenith of the %0a> firmament, it still could not reach GAR of the last, Supernal Hundred. Hence, %0a> there are only 370, while the Upper Thirty are absent in Ima. %0a> %0a> The same applies with regard to thousands— the Light of Aba does not use %0a> GAR of each thousand, but only VAK, i.e., 600 instead of 1,000. Instead of the %0a> GAR of each thousand, it uses thirteen (Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot (paths %0a> of) Hochma"). The number thirteen signifies Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot %0a> Hochma," the weak Light of Hochma, called the holy Apharsemon. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said that the Torah attained 370 Lights, and each of them divides %0a> into 613 beams; thus, in the 400 of Ima, thirty of the Upper Light of Hochma are %0a> absent, which leaves it with only 370. And each thousand lacks the Upper 400 %0a> (GAR of Hochma). Instead of using the thirteen paths of the holy Apharsemon, each %0a> thousand contains no more than 613, for all the supernal secrets are concealed in %0a> Rabbi Shimon's assembly. And the Creator Himself sealed them, for He ascends %0a> and becomes adorned with the achievements of all the righteous in the Torah. %0a> %0a> We know from the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 99:1) that everything the prophets %0a> ever said refers only to the days of the Mashiach's coming, but in the future %0a> (Yeshayahu, 64), everyone will behold the Creator themselves. For all the degrees %0a> and levels that refer to the days of the Mashiach will then be corrected, and all %0a> the secrets of the Torah will be revealed, everyone will attain complete revelation %0a> of the Light, of the Creator, as it is said, everyone will see with their own eyes %0a> (sight implies GAR de Hochma). %0a> %0a> From the aforesaid, it becomes clear that there exists an opportunity to %0a> correct one's individual Malchut de Malchut even before all the souls achieve it in %0a> the future. In such a case, man reaches his individual level of attainment of 400, %0a> although his general level cannot be higher than 370, as in the case of everybody %0a> else. This is the degree that Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Chizkiyah, and Achiyah ha %0a> Shiloni had reached. %0a> %0a> 59. The Mashiach said: "I have come here not to confirm the Torah of your %0a> assembly, but only because the 'owner of wings' is on his way here. For I know %0a> that he shall not enter any other assembly, but only yours." Meanwhile, Rabbi %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 208 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Shimon told him of the oath taken by the "owner of wings." Right then %0a> the Mashiach trembled in awe and raised his voice, and the Heavens shook, %0a> and the Great Sea boiled, and the Leviathan stirred, and the entire world %0a> threatened to overturn. %0a> %0a> At that moment, he saw Rabbi Chiya in Rabbi Shimon's adornments. %0a> He asked, "Who gave man in this world the adornments, garment of %0a> the other world?" (garment of the other world onto the body of this world). Rabbi %0a> Shimon answered, "This is Rabbi Chiya, the cresset of the Torah!" He said %0a> to him, "Gather him and his sons (those who have left this world), and they %0a> shall join your Assembly." Rabbi Shimon said, "Time was granted to him, %0a> he was granted time" (Rabbi Chiya' s time has not yet come). %0a> %0a> The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that he came not for the sake of the %0a> Torah, but because the "owner of wings" has come to the assembly, wishing to %0a> know what Matat had said. For Matat had revealed that the end of correction %0a> would be preceded by terrible suffering for Israel— the Heavens and the Great Sea %0a> would tremble, and the world would be on the verge of collapse, as predicted in %0a> the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 97): "All is broken." Hence, he raised his voice, wishing %0a> to mitigate all this upheaval. %0a> %0a> The Mashiach was surprised to see Rabbi Chiya's garment (that Rabbi Chiya %0a> exists in a physical body of our world, in the property of this world), for if he %0a> had merited the appearance of Matat and his oath, he had attained the degree %0a> of complete correction of all his evil. And since he merited seeing the Mashiach's %0a> face, to receive the Light of Yechida, he had obviously completed his work in this %0a> world, and there is nothing left for him to do here. Hence, he should leave it %0a> and enter Rabbi Shimon's assembly in the Garden of Eden. %0a> %0a> But Rabbi Shimon persuaded Rabbi Chiya that he needs to continue %0a> performing new, additional corrections in this world. And both the Mashiach %0a> and Rabbi Shimon explained to Rabbi Chiya what else specifically he still %0a> needed to do in this world. %0a> %0a> 60. Rabbi Chiya trembled in awe when the Mashiach left, and his eyes fulfilled %0a> with tears. For the Mashiach left Rabbi Shimon's Assembly weeping from the %0a> great desire for the final correction and redemption. And Rabbi Chiya was also %0a> anguished from the fervent desire to reach the end of correction. Rabbi Chiya %0a> cried and said: "Happy is the lot of the righteous in the other world, and happy %0a> is the lot of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who has merited all of this." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 61. Beresheet: Rabbi Shimon opened: "Put my words in your mouth. How %0a> much effort should man exert in the Torah day and night, for the Creator is %0a> attentive to those who study it. And with every word that man attains by his %0a> efforts in the Torah, he builds a firmament." %0a> %0a> The Creator gave the righteous the power of His speech. And just as the %0a> Creator creates the creature by the power of His word, so the righteous create %0a> new Heavens by its power. This is why Rabbi Shimon opened his speech by %0a> explaining the words, "In the beginning, the Creator created Heaven and %0a> earth," as the word Barah (created) also means "closing" and "limiting." And %0a> we must understand why the Creator had created it in such a closed form. %0a> He answers, "To put the correction of Heaven and earth in the words of %0a> the righteous, to make them His partners— participants in the creation of %0a> Heaven and earth." %0a> %0a> There are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth that the Creator %0a> enclosed in the mouths of the righteous: %0a> %0a> 1. The correction of Adam's sin, the correction of the past. Even before %0a> the creation of Adam, the Creator had made a secret correction of Heaven and %0a> earth, as it is described in the beginning of the Torah, in the chapter Beresheet: %0a> ZON de Atzilut ascended to AVI and to AA, while Adam ascended to ZON %0a> and YESHSUT. As a result, Adam received the Light of NRN de Atzilut, for he %0a> clothed YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, i.e., ascended to their level. %0a> %0a> Adam is located within the worlds BYA and he ascends together with these %0a> worlds. All the worlds can ascend above their permanent state or descend to %0a> their places with Adam inside of them. Adam's spiritual level and the Light that %0a> he receives are determined by his location (see page 212). %0a> %0a> 209 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 210 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> DURING ASCENT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> PERMANENT STATE %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Adam - Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT + ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa of the world of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Adam - Yetzira %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Beria %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Adam - Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yetzira %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In other sources, such as the Talmud {Bava Batra, 58:2), this is described %0a> as Adam's ascent to the level of the sun (ZA de Atzilut). This Light is called %0a> "Zihara Ilaa" (Zihara is the Aramaic word for Zohar in Hebrew or "radiant %0a> Light" in English). %0a> %0a> As a result of his sin, Adam fell spiritually to the level of our corporeal world %0a> (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1). And instead of NRN de Atzilut that he used to receive %0a> before his fall, he now receives the Light from the worlds BYA that are below %0a> Parsa. And as a result of Adam's sin, Heaven (ZA) and earth (Malchut) of the %0a> world of Atzilut descended to the level of VAK de ZA and the point of Malchut %0a> respectively, as they descended below Tahur de Partzuf AA. %0a> %0a> And the righteous that live in this world, but already exist spiritually in %0a> the spiritual worlds of BYA, are entrusted with the task of correcting all that %0a> transpired through Adam's fault, and to return, to renew the Heavens and the %0a> earth (ZON de Atzilut) and elevate them to AVI and AA— ZA to AA and Malchut %0a> to AVI, as it was before the sin. And as a result of their work, the righteous will %0a> receive the Light of the world of Atzilut that the corrected Adam is entitled to, %0a> for they (their souls, spiritual Kelim or inner spiritual Partzuf) are his parts. %0a> %0a> 2. However, even before the sin, Adam was not in the perfect state for which %0a> the Creator had created him. Hence, after the righteous correct the consequences %0a> of Adam's sin and attain NRN de Atzilut, which existed in Adam before the sin, %0a> new work awaits them— to receive new Upper Light that has yet to descend. In %0a> other words, if the first goal is to correct the sin, the second is to attain even %0a> more. It is called to "create new Heaven and earth," new properties of ZON, in %0a> which new, Higher Light can be received. %0a> %0a> This new level or degree that has never been present in any Kli is described %0a> as "neither hath an eye seen the Creator beside thee," and the degrees which %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 211 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the righteous attach to the worlds are called "new Heaven" and "new earth," for %0a> they are truly new and have never before existed in reality. %0a> %0a> And this Heaven and earth, which the righteous correct to the level that %0a> preceded Adam's sin, during the creation (Beresheet), are not called new, as they've %0a> already existed and the Creator Himself corrected them even before Adam's sin. %0a> Hence, they are called renewed, and the righteous who correct them are not %0a> called the Creator's partners. %0a> %0a> "Encloses in their mouths" implies reception of such Upper Light that was %0a> neither received by Adam nor emanated from the Creator. And now, by the %0a> actions of the righteous, which are called partners, participants and co-creators, %0a> it comes out and shines in creation. Thus we see that all the righteous are %0a> divided into two groups: those who correct Adam's sin and those who create %0a> new degrees of attainment. The latter are called the Creator's partners. %0a> %0a> ZA is called voice and Malchut is called speech. When a righteous person %0a> studies the Torah and thereby raises MAN (by the voice and speech of his To rah) %0a> from his soul to ZON, his voice ascends to ZA and his speech ascends to Malchut. %0a> The voice of the Torah that ascends with MAN to ZA is called the Creator %0a> (Kadosh Baruch Hu). %0a> %0a> Also, each renewed word in the Torah builds a new firmament. A word %0a> means speech, and any speech that renews the Torah by those who study it %0a> ascends in the form of MAN to Malchut, who is called "word and speech." This %0a> creates a new firmament in the form of a screen, on which a Zivug between the %0a> Creator and the Shechina is made. This is what the righteous, who study the %0a> Torah, attain by raising MAN! %0a> %0a> However, renewal in the words of the Torah does not imply anything new %0a> in the voice of the Torah. For Malchut has to recreate herself for each new Zivug, %0a> for after each Zivug, Malchut returns to the state of virginity thanks to the MAN %0a> raised by the righteous, who constantly renew her properties, her Yesod— the %0a> Kli for the reception of Light from ZA. Hence, it is written that the Torah is %0a> renewed by each word, for a word (Malchut) is renewed by the speech of the %0a> righteous in the Torah, as, after each Zivug, the previous Kli disappears and a %0a> new one appears. %0a> %0a> 62. We have learned that just as the Torah is renewed by one's mouth, that %0a> renewal ascends and appears before the Creator. And the Creator accepts this %0a> wisdom, kisses it, and adorns it with seventy adornments. And the renewed %0a> wisdom itself ascends and settles on the head of the righteous that revive the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 212 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> worlds, and then flies, soaring through 70,000 worlds, until it ascends to Atik, %0a> the Sefira Keter. And all that exists in Atik is concealed, Supernal wisdom. %0a> %0a> When a person raises MAN from his Torah, this word, which is Nukva de %0a> ZA, ascends and connects to the Creator in a Zivug with Him. The Creator takes %0a> this word, kisses, and adorns it, and these are the two types of Zivugim (plural %0a> for Zivug) in ZON: %0a> %0a> 1. Zivug de Neshikin (kisses); %0a> %0a> 2. Zivug de Yesodot (bases/ foundations). %0a> %0a> Each Zivug consists of two Zivugim, for a Zivug on Ohr Hochma must clothe %0a> itself into the Partzuf (garment) of Ohr Hassadim. Therefore, a preliminary Zivug %0a> must be made on Ohr Hassadim, whose role is to become a garment for Ohr %0a> Hochma. This is why each Zivug consists of two Zivugim: %0a> %0a> 1. Zivug on the degree of Hochma, called Zivug de Neshikin, because it %0a> stands at the Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf, at the level of Rosh and GAR. %0a> %0a> 2. Zivug on the degree of Hassadim, called Zivug de Yesodot, because it %0a> takes place at the level of the bodies of the Partzufim. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is said that the Creator took Nukva in this word and kissed her, %0a> i.e., made a Zivug de Neshikin at the level of GAR, and then adorned her, i.e., %0a> made a Zivug de Yesodot at the level of Hassadim. As a result, Ohr Hochma clothed %0a> in Ohr Hassadim, and Nukva received the complete Light. %0a> %0a> IN SEVENTY ADORNMENTS: the complete Light of Nuba is called %0a> "seventy adornments," because Malchut is the seventh day, and when she receives %0a> from ZA, her Sefirot become tens, just as the Sefirot of ZA; this turns Malchut into %0a> 7 x 10 = 70. Mochin (wisdom), Ohr Hochma is called Atara (adornment or crown). %0a> Hence, what she receives is called "seventy adornments." After Malchut receives %0a> the Light of Hassadim, with the help of the MAN of the righteous, she becomes %0a> fit to receive the Upper Light of Hochma, the seventy adornments. %0a> %0a> As was said above, there are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth (ZON): %0a> %0a> 1. When everything returns to the state preceding Adam's sin. In that %0a> instance, Malchut is called the "word of the Torah" ( VAK), where the %0a> Torah is ZA. %0a> %0a> 2. When Heaven and earth are created with a new Light, which even Adam %0a> did not attain prior to his sin. And this attainable word is called GAR. %0a> %0a> It is written (Talmud, Berachot, 7:1) that the righteous sit with adornments %0a> on their heads, for Malchut ascended to adorn the head of the righteous (ZA) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 213 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> in his Yesod, called Chai Qlamim (reviver of worlds), or, rather, in his Ateret %0a> Yesod-the place of circumcision. And this transpires thanks to the MAN raised %0a> by the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light of Adam's Zihara %0a> llaa, just as Rabbi Shimon and his friends have already attained it. %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma is called Ohr Haya. Since ZA desires only Hassadim, he can %0a> receive Ohr Haya only with the help of his Nukva, Malchut. It turns out that %0a> ZA lives, i.e., receives Ohr Haya, only if he is in a Zivug with Nukva, called Olam %0a> (world). That is how the name Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds) originated. %0a> %0a> Also, Nukva, the adornment on his head, becomes important (Keter - crown) %0a> because ZA receives this Light only thanks to his Malchut. Although Malchut was %0a> born from ZA, since it is Malchut and no other that evokes, makes reception of %0a> the Light of Life possible, ZA calls her his mother. Indeed, ZA receives Ohr Ha^a %0a> (the Light of Life) from her. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is written that Malchut flies and soars in 70,000 worlds, and %0a> after her Zivug with ZA on his Atara (adornment on his head), she ascends even %0a> higher, to AA, where the seven Sefirot of Malchut, called 70,000 worlds, become %0a> corrected, as one Sefira of ZA equals 10,000. After that, Malchut ascends higher %0a> still— to Atik. And all of these ascents of ZON to Atilc transpire thanks to the %0a> efforts made by the righteous that raise MAN: a Zivug on Atara elevates ZON to %0a> AVI, from which they ascend to AA (70,000 worlds), and from there to Atik, the %0a> highest possible point of ascent. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written that all the words of Atik 's Supernal wisdom are locked, %0a> since Malchut receives the Upper Light upon ascending to Atik, and each degree %0a> that she receives from Atik is called "concealed," "Supernal wisdom," i.e., GAR %0a> de Hochma. This is because words of wisdom signify the degree of Hochma, and %0a> the words "concealed," "secret," and "Supernal" refer to GAR. Also, they are %0a> revealed only to those who attain the level of Atik, but not below, as Tzimtzum %0a> Bet (the second restriction) already exists in AA. %0a> %0a> 63. And when this hidden wisdom, which is renewed here in this world, %0a> ascends, she joins Atik, ascends and descends, enters 18 worlds, where no %0a> eye has seen the Creator besides you. They emerge from there and appear %0a> before Atik, complete and perfect. Meanwhile, Atik tests her and finds her %0a> most desirable above all else. He then takes her and adorns her with 370,000 %0a> adornments. And she, the renewed Torah, ascends and descends, and is %0a> transformed into a firmament. %0a> %0a> During the ascent of Malchut to Atik, she joins the Zivug that transpires %0a> there, and creates Ohr Hoxer (Returning Light) by accepting Ohr Yashar (Direct %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 214 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Light) at the level of Atik's properties. The ascent of Malchut means that Malchut %0a> elevates Ohr Hozer from herself upwards. Malchut's descent means that she sends %0a> Ohr Yashar from Above downwards. And then Malchut receives the hidden, %0a> secret, and Supernal wisdom. The word "joins" signifies her contact with the %0a> Ohr Hozer and the Ohr Yashar within Atik itself. %0a> %0a> This Zivug is made in Atik on its Yesod, but not on Malchut, since Malchut de %0a> Atik is concealed until the end of correction. Like Yesod de ZA during its ascent %0a> to AVI, this Yesod is called Chai Olamim. The difference between them is that %0a> Yesod de Atik is called "No one else but you can see the Creator," for a Zivug on %0a> Yesod elevates Ohr Hozer and clothes Ohr Yashar with it. This screen is defined %0a> in AVI, below Atik, as wings that block the Upper Light. This shows that the %0a> screen possesses a force of restriction, law, judgment. This is why Ohr Hozer is %0a> also called "the Light of Restriction." Thus, Ohr Hozer exists in AVI. %0a> %0a> Conversely, the screen in Yesod de Atik, of which it is said that there "the %0a> Creator no longer hides from you" (Yeshayahu, 30:20), while it does raise Ohr %0a> Hozer, it does not conceal the Creator thereby, does not have the properties of %0a> wings. This is the reason why it is called Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds). %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, it remains concealed until man attains that level himself, as is %0a> written: "Only your eyes shall see the Creator." There are no wings or anything %0a> else there that conceal Him from outsiders' eyes, for no restrictions are imposed %0a> and everything is revealed. And neither are there any restrictions in Ohr Hozer, %0a> but only mercy and benevolence, as in Ohr Yashar. %0a> %0a> The name Chai Olamim implies that a Zivug is made not on ten Sefirot of %0a> Ohr Yashar from Above downwards and ten Sefirot of Ohr Hozer from below %0a> upwards, and not on the whole of the twenty Sefirot, i.e., not on Malchut herself, %0a> but on Yesod de Malchut. In this instance, there are nine Sefirot of Ohr Yashar %0a> and nine Sefirot of Ohr Hozer, as Yesod is the ninth Sefira: 9 + 9= 18= 10 + 8 = %0a> Yod + Chet, which is pronounced in reverse order as Chet-Yod (Chai), for this is %0a> the Returning Light. The word "life" (Chaim) is derived from the word "alive" %0a> (Chai), for he who is able to make a Zivug on Yesod receives the Upper Light of %0a> life, Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> Tremendous Upper Light manifests in Atik as a result of this Zivug. This %0a> is because all the worlds and all that inhabit them join Nukva, and together %0a> they attain true perfection, the level for which they were initially conceived and %0a> created by the Creator. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is said that word flies in the firmament, which signifies the creation %0a> of Ohr Hozer from below upwards, which leads to Ohr Yashar descending from %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 215 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the Creator, from Above downwards. And the clothing of Ohr Hozer on Ohr %0a> Yashar creates a firmament, because the screen that appears in Malchut for the %0a> creation of Ohr Hozer comes as a result of the good deeds of the righteous, their %0a> MAN (requests for spiritual ascent) aimed at pleasing the Creator. So then, after %0a> this screen makes a Zivug with the Upper Light, it becomes a firmament, with %0a> the help of which, the righteous attain the full height of the degree on which %0a> they have now made a Zivug. %0a> %0a> This occurs because when this degree descends to the righteous through the %0a> firmament, it clothes in Ohr Hozer (garment of this firmament), which, together %0a> with the Ohr Yashar clothed within it, turn over and they descend below the %0a> screen (firmament) and thereby become attainable by the righteous. %0a> %0a> Those righteous that have achieved such perfection that they can raise %0a> MAN to such exalted Zivug have already rid themselves of egoism completely %0a> and have no desire to receive anything for themselves. Instead, they raise their %0a> MAN (request) with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator. Therefore, by %0a> their corrections (MAN), they correct the screen in Malchut, and, by creating %0a> Ohr Hozer in her, which ascends from the screen of Malchut upwards, make her %0a> capable of a great Zivug. This is because all that ascends is altruism, bestowal, %0a> repelling, and rejecting reception for oneself and egoistic pleasure. %0a> %0a> Then there is a Zivug with the Upper Light, and the Upper Light clothes %0a> in the ascending Returning Light. This descending Upper Light clothes into %0a> the Returning Light and enters into the righteous that have raised MAN. The %0a> expression "from below upwards" implies the repelling of Light by a person, and %0a> "from Above downwards" designates a person's reception. %0a> %0a> And since the Upper Light comes to man through a firmament, it takes %0a> the Light reflected from the firmament as its garment, and one receives the %0a> Upper Light clothed in Returning Light. This means that, even after one already %0a> receives the spiritual information of the entire degree, he delights in the Upper %0a> Light that descends to him only to the extent in which he can please the Creator %0a> thereby, i.e., to the extent of his strength, the magnitude of his screen, and the %0a> amount of Returning Light that clothes the Direct Upper Light. %0a> %0a> Such reception of the Upper Light (only to the extent of the magnitude of %0a> Ohr Hozer created by man) is called the reception for the Creator's sake. And %0a> wherever one cannot find a way to bestow upon the Creator, he does not receive. %0a> Hence, his reception is clothed in bestowal: the Upper Direct Light is clothed in %0a> Returning Light, meaning the lower one receives only the clothed Upper Light %0a> from the Upper One, i.e., only through the firmament. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 216 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 64. And thus, every deed creates firmaments that appear before Atik, and he %0a> calls them "new Heavens" or, rather, "renewed firmaments," concealed by %0a> Supernal wisdom. And all the other parts of the Torah that are not renewed %0a> by means of Supernal wisdom appear before the Creator, ascend and become %0a> "the lands of life" (Artzot HaChaim). They then descend and adorn one land. %0a> And it becomes renewed, and a new land comes into being from all that was %0a> renewed in the Torah. %0a> %0a> The righteous are constantly raising newer and newer MAN, and thus %0a> receive newer and newer degrees of attainments from Atik, with the help of the %0a> firmaments created by the Upper Zivug. From these firmaments emerge new %0a> Heavens, which are renewed in the degrees of Atik. These exalted attainments %0a> of the righteous are therefore called the hidden secrets of Supernal wisdom, for %0a> they descend clothed in the garments received from the firmaments. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called "earth" and Bina is called "the lands of life" (Artzot %0a> HaChaim). When Malchut attains all the degrees of Bina, she acquires the name %0a> "the land of life." Malchut is also called the "new land," for she exchanges her %0a> own properties for those of Bina. And everything that was previously Malchut %0a> now becomes Bina. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is written that in the future, BON will become SAG, and MA %0a> will become AB, for Heaven is ZA that now ascended to the degree of Atik (AB %0a> or Hochma). The earth, Nukva de ZA, Malchut, became SAG, Bina. Hence, the %0a> new land and the new Heavens are Malchut and ZA that became SAG and AB, %0a> Atik and AA. %0a> %0a> 65. It is written, "When the new land and the new Heavens, which I make." %0a> It is not written, "I have made," in past tense, but rather "I make," in present %0a> tense, for they are constantly made from the renewal and secrets of the Torah. %0a> And it is written of this: "And I shall place it in your mouth, and in the %0a> shadow of your hands' garments, that I may take the Heavens, and lay the %0a> foundations of the land" (Yeshayahu, 51:16). It is simply said "Heavens," for %0a> it implies the Heavens renewed by the Torah. %0a> %0a> Everything that is described in the Torah is written in the present tense, %0a> as there is no time in the spiritual; everything is written with regard to the one %0a> /ho attains the Torah at that given moment. This is what The Zohar wants %0a> ess here: the matter concerns man's constant work on himself, on his %0a> %0a> the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light continue cr %0a> ver and newer Heavens and lands, as is written, "The righteous ascend frc %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 217 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 66. Rabbi Elazar said, "What is the meaning of 'in the shadow of your hands' %0a> garments?'". He answered, when the Torah was passed to Moshe, tens of %0a> thousands of Supernal angels appeared so as to raise him with the flames of %0a> their mouths, but the Creator protected him. So now, when the renewal in %0a> the Torah ascends and appears before the Creator, He protects it and shelters %0a> the one who performed it, so as to prevent the angels from finding out and %0a> envying him, until new Heaven and earth are made out of this renewal in %0a> the Torah. Hence, it is said, "To take the Heavens and lay the foundations of %0a> the land from the shadow of your hands' garments." It follows that all that is %0a> concealed from the eyes achieves a supernal result. This is why it is said, "In %0a> the shadow of your hands' garments." Yet, why should it be concealed from %0a> the eyes for the sake of a supernal result? Hence, it is immediately said, "So %0a> that I may take the Heavens and lay the foundations of the land." As we have %0a> learned— so that new Heavens and earth will appear out of this concealment. %0a> %0a> The phrase "In the shadow of your hands' garments" alludes to Ohr Hozer, %0a> the garment that stems from the firmament, clothing and covering of the Ohr %0a> Hochma. Like a shadow, this garment conceals Hochma from outsiders' eyes, so %0a> they do not know what is inside. Why are High Degrees concealed from angels? %0a> So they would not envy man, for when the angels, which are made of a very light %0a> material (without egoism), look at one who is righteous and see his negative %0a> properties, they envy him for the High Degree that he has achieved. They then %0a> begin slandering that righteous, the properties that they discover in him. This %0a> brings harm to the righteous. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when a degree clothes into the garment of a firmament (Ohr %0a> Hozer), this garment measures the degree itself, its magnitude, to prevent man %0a> from receiving more than his intention for the Creator's sake allows, i.e., only %0a> to the extent of Ohr Hozer. Thus, he is protected from the angels' envy and from %0a> their ability to harm his spiritual condition, for he becomes equal to them in his %0a> properties: his Returning Light makes him equal. %0a> %0a> Like everything else that fills the worlds, Melachim (angels) are man's %0a> inner properties and forces. In order to avoid harming himself by wishing to %0a> attain Higher Degrees before he has acquired Ohr Hozer, these degrees must %0a> be concealed. However, in addition to Ohr Hozer, one should exercise caution %0a> against his desire. %0a> %0a> This explains the rule: "The eye sees and the heart covets," and man would %0a> not be able to protect his intention, to keep it for the Creator's sake alone, and %0a> would desire to receive for himself. However, once clothed in the garment of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 218 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the firmament, he can be certain that he will not receive above his intention to %0a> receive for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> examine how a desire is conceived m man. %0a> something for the first time, not yet knowing what he is going to see. It is as %0a> if an object accidentally falls into his field of vision. Naturally, no ban can be %0a> imposed on it, as this occurrence is not dependent on man; thus, it is neither %0a> rewarded nor punished. %0a> %0a> However, when looking at it for the second time— here, man already has free- %0a> dom of choice. And if the second look is going to result in the desire to receive %0a> pleasure, it is forbidden. If man cannot restrain himself, and looks for the second %0a> time, his eyes send a signal to his heart, and the heart begins to desire. Thus, man %0a> has the power to decide whether or not to allow the desire to be born within hi %0a> This is the meaning of the phrase: "The eye sees and the heart covets." %0a> %0a> 67. He said to these gates and to the words that were set one upon the other in %0a> the renewed Torah: "Who are you with? You are my partners. Just as I make %0a> the Heavens and the earth with My words, as it is written, 'By the Creator's %0a> word were the Heavens made,' so you create new Heavens and earth by your %0a> labor in the Torah." %0a> %0a> The properties of reception are called "gates," because, like open gates, they %0a> are always ready to receive. "Words" are the properties of bestowal, of raising %0a> MAN to the Creator. The phrase "Set one upon the other" signifies one clothing %0a> the other, and so occurs reception for the sake of bestowal. %0a> %0a> 68. However, if one were to claim that the renovation of the Torah by one %0a> who does not even know what he is saying creates a firmament, then look %0a> at one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah: since he renews the %0a> Torah without having sufficient knowledge, all that he renews ascends, and %0a> the reverse side of man (male part of the impure force), and the false tongue %0a> (from Nukva of the impure force, called Tehom Raba— great abyss) comes %0a> toward him. This reversed man skips 500 Parsaot (measures of distance) to %0a> receive this renewal of the Torah, takes it and makes a false firmament out of %0a> it, called Tohu (abyss). %0a> %0a> As we already know, the righteous raise MAN to please the Creator. This %0a> is called the "words of the Torah," for the words are renewed as a result of the %0a> Upper Zivug, and ZON receive a new Light from this Zivug, to the extent that %0a> they come to merit the renewal of Heaven and earth by their actions. They %0a> thereby become the Creator's partners— fellow workers, for, just like Him, they %0a> renew Heaven and earth with their words. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 219 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Although one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah (the ways of %0a> the Creator) so as to know how to protect himself and to not harm the Higher %0a> Degrees tells himself that his intention is for the exalted goal, he deludes himself, %0a> for he does not know that which his soul surely knows— that his intentions are %0a> for himself. Terrible punishment awaits him, for he allows the impure forces to %0a> destroy those who labor in the Torah. The Zohar explains: if one does not know %0a> the exact meanings of the words, i.e., if he raises MAN to the great Zivug without %0a> a thorough understanding of all the intricate details of the act, the reverse man %0a> and the false tongue capture his word. %0a> %0a> Klipot (one's impure forces) also consist of male and female parts. The male %0a> part is called "fruitless return," and the female part is called "falsehood." The %0a> male part of the Klipa is not as bad as the female part. And when it is by itself, %0a> it does not prompt one to lie by the Creator's name; on the contrary, goodness %0a> strikes his eye, yet the eye itself is evil. And he who falls into the hands of the male %0a> impure force uses the Creator's name in vain, for he detaches himself from the %0a> Creator and receives no Light from Him, i.e., he utters words and seemingly acts, %0a> but fruitlessly, for these actions are not the screen's interaction with the Light. %0a> %0a> Hence, the sages said: "The Creator says of all who is proud: He and I cannot %0a> be together" (Talmud, Suta, 5: 1), for his intentions are to receive everything for %0a> himself, for his own benefit, for his pride and vanity, as the sensation of one's %0a> "I" is the greatest manifestation of pride. Hence, man falls under the power of %0a> the evil eye. Consequently, the MAN that he raises receives no response from %0a> Above, and he utters the Creator's name in vain. Therefore, the male part of the %0a> impure force is called empty, fruitless, false, vain, unsuccessful, and futile, for %0a> the Creator cannot unite with him due to the dissimilarity of their properties. %0a> %0a> If, however, one feels not his similarity to the Creator, but rather his %0a> oppositeness in properties from Him, and perceives himself as the most evil of %0a> all, he can then lower himself before the Creator, suppress all of his properties %0a> out of hatred for them, and the Creator Himself will perform the remaining part %0a> of his correction. However, one who is proud not only fails to understand the %0a> extent of his remoteness from the Creator, he actually believes that he is entitled %0a> to receive more than others, and that the Creator owes him something. %0a> %0a> Nukva de Klipa is called "falsehood." After one falls into the net of the male %0a> part of the impure force, the latter makes a Zivug with its Nukva (impure, bitter, %0a> and evil force), which, as a result of its connection to the male part, falsifies the %0a> Creator's name, descends and instigates man, and then ascends, complaints %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 220 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> against him, and takes his soul. However holy this soul was, Nukva de Klipa grabs %0a> all of it for itself. %0a> %0a> Naturally, this refers to one who works on himself and advances spiritually, %0a> for whom working for the Creator's sake is his life's calling. Yet, he may %0a> occasionally fail to observe precisely all the restrictions, and thus find himself %0a> in such states. An ordinary person, however, who neither works on himself %0a> nor studies Kabbalah, is obviously entirely unrelated to either pure or impure %0a> spiritual forces. %0a> %0a> For example, the male impure force says that one must study the Torah, but %0a> then steals the results of his work for itself. As a result, man loses interest in his %0a> studies, and must once more consolidate himself in his efforts and advancement. %0a> And although he attains the Creator and the revelation of Light to a certain %0a> degree, it is nonetheless fruitless, for all of his attainments vanish from him, and %0a> he gains nothing from them. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Torah refers to it as the "reverse man," for initially he ate %0a> and drank and said "Go," i.e., raise MAN to the Creator and receive the Light %0a> for the sake of the exalted goal, but not for yourself. Thus, it pretends that it %0a> is not the impure force, but its opposite. However, due to its property called %0a> "fruitless return," it then makes a Zivug with its Nukva (the great abyss), which %0a> steals man's soul and destroys him with its falsehood, and man is left without %0a> even the slightest part of his soul that is holy and pure! %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written that he skips through 500 Parsaot: initially, ZON of %0a> the impure forces have only VAfC in ZA and a point in Malchut. Consequently, %0a> they can only be equal to ZON de Atzilut in their Katnut (small state), when %0a> they are also VAK and a point, and have neither the power nor the place to %0a> connect to Bina. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, the male impure %0a> force is given the opportunity to skip through ZAT de Bina, which sustain the pure %0a> and holy ZON. ZON contain Sefirot HGT NH (Netzah-Hod) = 5x 100 = 500, since %0a> a Sefira in Bina equals 100. And this occurs thanks to the MAN raised by one who %0a> is uncertain of his intentions (whether or not he acts for the Creator's sake). %0a> %0a> The "reverse man" then makes a Zivug with his Nukva on this false MAN, %0a> and receives the Upper Light for the construction of his Partzuf, much like the %0a> spiritually pure Heavens that were created on the pure MAN. Also, the new %0a> Heavens created on the impure MAN are called "reverse," "empty." And since the %0a> impure Malchut took part in this, these Heavens are called Tohu (abyss/ chaos). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is Your Partner? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 221 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 69. And this reverse man then flies across the empty firmament, traversing %0a> 6,000 Parsaot in one bound. And as soon as this empty firmament stops, %0a> an impure woman emerges at once, seizes onto this empty firmament, and %0a> partakes in it. She leaves it and slays hundreds of thousands, for as long as she %0a> remains in this firmament, she has the authority and power to fly and traverse %0a> the whole world in an instant. %0a> %0a> All that stems from the empty firmament stems from the impure force, which %0a> is correspondingly opposite the Supernal, holy wisdom of Ohr Hochma. The %0a> Sefira Hochma equals 1,000, and so it is written that it flies across the firmament %0a> in 6,000 = six Sefirot HGT NHY of Partzuf Hochma, each of which equals 1,000. %0a> %0a> After the new heavens of the impure male part, called the "empty heavens," %0a> were completed, the power of its female half, Nulcva ("the great abyss"), was %0a> revealed. Her force attacked the firmament with falsehood by the Creator's %0a> name; she soared through the sky, and the heavens were then called Tohu. %0a> %0a> Since Nukva of the impure forces partakes in this firmament, she becomes %0a> stronger and grows even more than the male level of the impure part. This is %0a> because the male impure part reaches up to VAK of Hochma, which equals 6,000 %0a> Parsaot, whereas Nukva grows to the full ten Sefirot, i.e., the entire world. %0a> %0a> Therefore, she is immensely powerful and can destroy many, for, as Rashi %0a> says, "The Creator created one opposite the other." And just as new, Holy %0a> Heavens and lands are created thanks to the MAN raised by the righteous, new, %0a> impure heavens and lands are created through the MAN raised by those who do %0a> not know exactly how one should work for the Creator. %0a> %0a> 70. It is written of it: "Do not facilitate fruitless transgression." Transgression %0a> is related to the male part, and is as heavy as wagon shafts. What is this %0a> transgression? It is the impure Nukva. With reins she draws the male impure %0a> part to fruitlessness. And then, as a result, a transgression is committed, as %0a> the male part draws itself towards this Nukva, who grows strong and flies off %0a> to slay people. And many does she slay. And who is it that caused all this? It %0a> is those that study the Torah, but do not attain Ohrah and Morah (Light and %0a> bestowal). May the Creator be merciful to them! %0a> %0a> As was already mentioned above, the male impure part is not as evil as the %0a> female part. This is so because it makes itself similar to the holy part of the %0a> creature; hence, it is called fruitless. However, due to this similarity, it has great %0a> power to ensnare man, as, for example, just as the sages do, it encourages people %0a> to study the Torah. Yet, its goals are different from that of the Creator; it wants %0a> to receive wisdom (Hochma), and not to become altruistic. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 222 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> And after one is caught in its toils, the male impure force makes a Zivug %0a> with its impure Nukva, and, like heavy wagon shafts, they pull man into an abyss %0a> so great and dark that he doesn't even realize that he is in darkness. On the %0a> contrary, he considers himself wise and righteous. The male part only catches %0a> man, binds him, and then brings him to the impure Nukva and casts him at her %0a> feet. Only then does he falter, falls into the great abyss and perishes. %0a> %0a> 71. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "I beg of you not to utter any discernments %0a> from the Torah, no matter what you may hear from the Great Tree of Truth, %0a> so that you would not assist the impure Nukva in slaying multitudes of people %0a> for naught." They all opened and mouthed: "Save us, O Merciful One! Save %0a> us, O Merciful One!" %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon said that if you have attained the discernment yourselves, %0a> then you are allowed, but if not, you must listen to the Great Tree (the great %0a> learned sage, whose wisdom and purity can be trusted) to learn how to work %0a> for the Creator. %0a> %0a> 72. Come and see, the Creator created the world by the Torah. And He looked %0a> into the Torah not once, not twice, not thrice, and not four times. Only after %0a> that did He create the world. This should show people how not to err. %0a> %0a> 73. Opposite these four times, the Creator saw, counted, prepared, and %0a> investigated what He had created. It is therefore written, "Beresheet (In %0a> the beginning) Barah (created) Elokim (the Creator) Et (the)"— four words, %0a> corresponding to the four above. And then, it is written: "Heaven"— opposite %0a> all four words, for the Creator looked into the Torah before He began to %0a> manifest His thought into reality. %0a> %0a> The four words signify four time periods or four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M. "Saw" %0a> designates Hochma, "counted"— Bina, "prepared"— ZA, and "investigated"— %0a> Malchut. After these four, the Creator created what He created. %0a> %0a> We find the same in the Torah: Beresheet is Hochma, Barah is Bina, Elokim is %0a> ZA, and Et (the) is Malchut, which includes everything from Aleph to Tav— all the %0a> letters and all the properties. Hence, she is designated in the Torah by the word %0a> Et = Aleph-Tav (from the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, to the last, %0a> Tav). And after these four, He created the Heavens and the earth, i.e., revealed %0a> the next, lower degree, below Malchut. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 74. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, was on his way to visit his father- %0a> in-law, Rabbi Yosi, the son of Lakunya, and Rabbi Aba accompanied him. A %0a> man followed behind them, driving their donkeys. Rabbi Aba said, "Let us %0a> open the gates of the Torah, as it is time to correct our path." %0a> %0a> In Aramaic, the language in which The Zohar was written, "driver" means %0a> "one who pricks." This is because the donkey driver's function amounts to %0a> forcing the donkeys to move by pricking them with the edge of his stick. %0a> %0a> 75. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "It is written: My Sabbaths you are to %0a> observe." Let us see: the Creator created the world in six days. And each day %0a> would reveal His deeds, and gave strength to that day. When did He reveal %0a> His deeds and give them strength? On the fourth day of creation, for the first %0a> three days were concealed completely, and would not be revealed. The fourth %0a> day arrived, and He revealed the deeds and forces of all the days. %0a> %0a> The phrase "He gave that day strength" means that He gave everything to %0a> the day of Shabbat. For the six days are Sefirot HGT NHY that reveal on Shabbat %0a> (Malchut) the work and the forces that were carried out during these days. %0a> %0a> Yet, if the deeds of all the days are concealed, and only reveal at their end, %0a> on Shabbat, then why is it written that they are revealed on the fourth day of %0a> creation? The thing is that Malchut is called both the fourth and the seventh days: %0a> she is fourth with regard to the first three Sefirot HGT, called the "Patriarchs" %0a> (Hesed is Avraham, Gevura is Yitzchak, and Tifferet is Yaakov), and seventh with %0a> regard to the six Sefirot, after three additional Sefirot, called the "Sons": Netzah is %0a> Moshe, Hod is Aaron, and Yesod is Yosef. %0a> %0a> Malchut herself is King David— the day of Sbabbat. Malchut grows and gradually %0a> accumulates her corrections in two principal stages, called Ibur (conception). %0a> The first three days correspond to Ibur Aleph (the first conception), and the %0a> %0a> 223 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 224 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> second three days correspond to Ibur Bet (the second conception, Gadlut, the %0a> reception of Ohr Hochma). %0a> %0a> In other words, Malchut is gradually created from Sefirot HGT of ZA in three %0a> days, and forms on the fourth day as the Sefira Net^ah de ZA. Hence, at this stage in %0a> her growth, Malchut is referred to as fourth from the Patriarchs. And then Shabbat %0a> comes to our land (Malchut is called both land/ earth and Shabbat). The state that %0a> Malchut achieves as a result of her growth from Sefirot NHY of ZA is called Shabbat %0a> on earth. And this state she attains as the seventh Sefira from all the Sefirot of ZA. %0a> %0a> The first three days are not revealed in Malchut, for as long as a Partzuf %0a> lacks Malchut, it is defined as concealed or secret. The weekdays are defined so. %0a> And when Malchut completely attains the degree where she stands, she thereby %0a> attains herself. This state is defined as Shabbat. %0a> %0a> However, if Malchut receives from the six Sefirot de ZA, shouldn't they (the six %0a> weekdays) be more important than Malchut-Shabbat (inferior Sefira with regard %0a> to those she receives from)? %0a> %0a> The truth is that all the weekdays constitute individual degrees of correction %0a> (weekdays' work) that are devoid of Malchut. Hence, they are called "weekdays," %0a> for a Partzuf without Malchut is considered a closed degree, unable to receive %0a> Light, and is therefore deprived of holiness. After all, in the absence of Malchut, %0a> there is no GAR of the Light, Ohr Hochma. And only when Malchut is revealed %0a> in the Partzuf (signifying the arrival of Shabbat) is the holiness of the ENTIRE %0a> degree revealed; ENTIRE, because all six days receive what they have earned, %0a> and the Light shines in all the weekdays thanks to them alone. %0a> %0a> When the first three days of creation HGT emerged before the emergence %0a> of Malchut, these three Sefirot were devoid of Light, i.e., they were concealed. %0a> And when Malchut appeared, the fourth day arrived, and the importance and %0a> holiness of all four days manifested, for Malchut complements the entire degree, %0a> and the perfection of creation becomes revealed thanks to her. In the language %0a> of Kabbalah, this is described in the following way: all six days of creation are %0a> Ohr Hochma, and Shabbat is Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma is present on weekdays, %0a> but cannot shine for lack of Ohr Hassadim, and when Ohr Hassadim arrives on %0a> Shabbat, all the Ohr Hochma shines thanks to this Ohr Hassadim of Shabbat. %0a> %0a> 76. There is fire, water and air— HQT — the three first days of creation. %0a> Although they are the initial Supernal foundations of all that will follow, %0a> their actions are not revealed until the earth, meaning Malchut, reveals them. %0a> Only then does the work of each of the Supernal foundations reveal itself. %0a> Hence, the power of the first three days is revealed only on the fourth. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 225 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 77. However, the third day may be better described as one that reveals the %0a> creation of the first three days, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING %0a> FORTH GRASS. That is to say, the revelation of the earth's (Malchut's) deeds %0a> already took place on the third day. Yet, although it was written on the third %0a> day, Tifferet, it was actually the fourth day, Malchut. Malchut joined the %0a> third day, for Tifferet and Malchut are inseparable. And then the fourth day %0a> revealed its deeds— to elucidate the work of each and every one of HQT, for %0a> the fourth day is the "fourth leg" of the Supernal Throne (the Sefira Bind), %0a> whose four legs are HQTM (Hesed, Qevura, Tifferet, and Malchut). %0a> %0a> Malchut reveals the holiness and spiritual power of the three days. Therefore, %0a> Malchut ascended and joined the third day, so as to reveal by the unity of these %0a> three days (three lines) their exalted spiritual essence. %0a> %0a> It is hence written that the deed is revealed on the fourth day, for Malchut %0a> alone completes their revelation at the conclusion of the three days. And %0a> afterwards, three more days emerge, which are NHY. After the revelation of %0a> the holiness of the first three days, HGT, called the "Patriarchs," which are the %0a> foundation of ZA, ZA enters them (his main part is manifested), and the time %0a> comes for the Sons (NHY, the last three of the six days of creation) to be born. %0a> %0a> This is why it is written that ZA is defined as the fourth leg of the throne %0a> of Bina, and the throne remains imperfect and incomplete until its fourth leg %0a> (foundation) manifests. Indeed, ZA is incomplete until Malchut manifests within %0a> him, i.e., until the fourth day arrives. And only after the emergence of Malchut %0a> can ZA father the Sons— the three final days of creation. %0a> %0a> 78. All of the actions of all the Sefirot, both on the first three days of creation, %0a> HQT, and on the last three, NHY, are dependent on the day of Shabbat, %0a> Malchut, QAR of the entire degree of ZA and its perfection. Hence, it is %0a> written, AND THE CREATOR RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY, %0a> SHABBAT. This refers to the fourth leg of the throne, as the seventh and the %0a> fourth days are both Malchut. Only the fourth day is Malchut that includes %0a> the Sefira Tifferet of ZA, from his chest upwards. Also, the seventh day is %0a> Malchut of the entire ZA, and they merge together face to face in a Zivug. %0a> %0a> Although the first three days, HGT, end with the fourth day (the result of %0a> their actions), they nonetheless remain not entirely complete; their perfection %0a> manifests only on Shabbat, together with the last three days, NHY. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written that Sbabbat is the fourth leg of the throne, even %0a> though it is the seventh day, for, although it emerges after the Sons, it also %0a> completes the deeds of the Patriarchs, as the first three days did not complete %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 226 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> their corrections on the fourth day, and a seventh day, Shabbat, is needed to %0a> complete them. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that on the fourth day, Malchut is in the state of %0a> Katnut, called the small phase of the Moon. As a result, the Moon (Malchut) %0a> returns to the state called Shabbat, when all the Light of all the days of creation %0a> manifest and shine within her. This is why the Light of the first three days of %0a> creation becomes revealed only on Shabbat. %0a> %0a> 79. Yet, if Shabbat is Malchut, then why does the Torah say, "My Sabbaths %0a> you are to observe," implying two? It is written of the two parts of Shabbat'. %0a> the night (Malchut) and the day (ZA) that shines in Malchut. Thus, there %0a> is no division between them, for they merge face to face in a Zivug, and are %0a> therefore called two Sabbaths. %0a> %0a> He asks: two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) of the fourth and the seventh days %0a> are completely separate, as is written, "You shall keep my Sabbaths," implying %0a> two? Yet, when we clarify that the fourth day manifests in perfection only on the %0a> seventh day, it becomes clear that there is only one Shabbat. But what is meant %0a> here is ZA and Malchut that shine in the holiness of Shabbat, for this day is the %0a> male, bestowing part (Zachar) that manifests in the female part (Malchut or Nukva). %0a> Hence, they are called Sabbaths (plural). However, by merging in perfection, they %0a> become a single whole. As a result, ZA also assumes the name of Shabbat. %0a> %0a> 80. Following behind them with the donkeys, the donkey driver asked: "Why %0a> is it said, 'You shall fear sanctity?'" They replied: "This refers to the sanctity of %0a> Shabbat." The donkey driver asked: "What is the sanctity of Shabbat?" They %0a> replied: "It is the sanctity that descends from Above, from AVI." He said to %0a> them, "If that is so, then Shabbatot (plural for Shabbat) are without sanctity, %0a> for sanctity descends on it from Above, from AVI." Rabbi Aba answered him: %0a> "It is indeed so." And it is said: "And call Shabbat a delight, a holy day dedicated %0a> to the Creator." Shabbat and a holy day are mentioned separately. The donkey %0a> driver asked: "If that is so, then what does a holy day mean to the Creator?" %0a> He replied: "That is when sanctity descends from Above, from ZA, and fills %0a> Shabbat, Malchut." The donkey driver objected, "But if sanctity descends %0a> from Above, then Shabbat itself is not a holy day. And yet, it is written, You %0a> shall sanctify Shabbat,' meaning Shabbat itself." Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi %0a> Aba, "Leave this man alone, for there is much wisdom in him, of which we do %0a> not know." So he said to the donkey driver, "Speak, and we shall listen." %0a> %0a> The donkey driver's question is this: if Shabbat is ZA, then why is it described %0a> as holy? After all, sanctity is the property of AVI, and only AVI are called holy. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 227 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, he objected that Shabbat should be separated from sanctity. Shabbat (ZA) %0a> is not holiness in itself, but because it receives holiness from Above, from AVI. %0a> That, which ZA receives from AVI is what is called the Creator's holiness. %0a> %0a> 81. The donkey driver opened and said, "It is written: Shabbatot, i.e., there %0a> are usually two. And this alludes to the border of Shabbat, which is 2,000 %0a> AmaH (cubits) in each direction from the city. This is why the word Et was %0a> added before the word Shabbatot, which designates the plural form— both the %0a> Upper Shabbat and the lower Shabbat joining into one." %0a> %0a> Although it is said: "Man shall not leave his place on the seventh day" %0a> (Shemot, 16), i.e., the singular form is used, in many places in the Torah, the %0a> word Et is used; for example, in the sentence: "Et 2,000 Amah in each direction %0a> from its place." The word Et, consisting of the first and the last letters of the %0a> alphabet, Aleph and Tav, designates Malchut entering into union with ZA, %0a> which signifies the state of Shabbat; hence, the Light of AVI becomes revealed %0a> and shines (as a supplementary luminescence) upon ZON. This is because AVI %0a> are called "two thousand," and so the word Et is present here to designate a %0a> supplement of Light to Shabbat. %0a> %0a> There exist a Shabbat Above and a Shabbat below: the Upper Shabbat is Partzuf %0a> Tvuna, and the lower part of Partzuf Bina, whereas the lower Shabbat is Partzuf %0a> Malchut, Nukva de ZA of the world of Atzilut. In the world of Atzilut, Partzuf Bina %0a> is divided into two Partzuf im: the Upper Part of Bina is called Partzuf AVI and the %0a> lower part of Bina (the part where she receives the Light from the Upper Part %0a> so as to pass it to ZA) is called Partzuf YESHSUT (Israel Saba ve Tvuna) or simply %0a> Tvuna. The relationship between Bina-AVI and Tvuna is similar to that of ZA %0a> and Malchut. Bina is called the "Upper World" and Malchut is called the "lower %0a> world." On Shabbat, ZON ascend to Bina, ZA to AVI, and Malchut to Tvuna. %0a> %0a> On Shabbat, Malchut merges with Tvuna. However, this does not mean that %0a> no difference is left between them, for Malchut receives the Light from Tvuna %0a> only because she ascends to Tvuna 's level. Yet, at her place on the last, lowest %0a> degree of the world of Atzilut, Malchut is unable to receive the Light from Tvuna. %0a> And to the extent that Malchut cannot yet receive the Light from Tvuna in her %0a> regular state, she is defined as "closed." %0a> %0a> Also, Tvuna suffers from Malchut being closed because while in her place, %0a> Malchut cannot receive the Light from Tvuna, for the revelation of Tvuna is %0a> possible only through Malchut. On Shabbat, Tvuna and Ima join to form one %0a> Partzuf, which is not closed. Yet, since its Light shines only when Malchut ascends %0a> to it, Tvuna feels the closed state of Malchut, and suffers, too. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 228 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 82. One Shabbat was left, unmentioned Above, and felt ashamed. She said to %0a> Him, "The Creator of the universe, from the day I was created, I am called %0a> Shabbat, but there is no day without night." The Creator replied to her: "My %0a> daughter, you are Shabbat, and I have given you this name. But now I am %0a> surrounding and adorning you with the most exalted adornment." He then %0a> raised His voice and proclaimed, "Those who sanctify shall fear. And this is %0a> the night of Shabbat that radiates fear." But who is she? It is the merging %0a> together of I (Malchut, the nights of Shabbat) with the Creator Himself (ZA) %0a> into a single whole. And I've heard from my father that the word Et refers %0a> to the boundaries-borders of Shabbat. Shabbatot (two Sabbaths) denote a %0a> circle and a square within, which total two. According to them, there are %0a> two sanctities we should mention during the Shabbat blessing: Vayechulu %0a> consists of thirty-five words, and Kiddush, too, consists of thirty-five words. %0a> Collectively, they make up to the seventy names of ZA, with which ZA (the %0a> Creator), and Malchut (the Assembly of Israel) adorn themselves. %0a> %0a> 83. Since the circle and square are Shabbatot, they are both included in the %0a> instruction, "My Shabbatot you are to observe." However, the Upper Shabbat %0a> is not included in the instruction "Observe," but rather in "Remember." For %0a> the Supernal King, Bina is as perfect as memory. This is why Bina is called %0a> "King," whose perfection lies in peace and in memory. Hence, there is no %0a> contradiction Above. %0a> %0a> Malchut de Malchut is called the central point of creation, and receives no %0a> Light even on Shabbat, as, being a Man'ula (lock), she is closed to the Light. %0a> And the entire Light enters her only in the form of Miftacha (key), into Yesod de %0a> Malchut, in Malchut that joins Bina with her properties, while Malchut herself is %0a> therefore referred to as "locked." %0a> %0a> This central point of creation is the only thing that the Creator created, and %0a> is comprised of all the creatures, including human souls. And she argues with %0a> the Creator that in the beginning of creation, in the world of AK, the entire %0a> Light was revealed and shone upon the creatures thanks to her, for there was no %0a> other Malchut in the world of AK, except for the central point. And only due to %0a> Tzimtzum Bet (second restriction), now in the world of Atzilut, was she restricted %0a> and closed to the reception of Light. %0a> %0a> And this is a great and wonderful secret, for, as Malchut objects, even on %0a> the first day, it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning- %0a> one day." (Beresheet, 1:6) In other words, unity is revealed in both night and %0a> day together. Yet, why is the night of the first Shabbat not mentioned in the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 229 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Torah, and only the words "on the seventh day" are used? The Creator replied %0a> to Malchut that a future Shabbat is implied— Shabbat of the seventh millennium, %0a> when the day of Shabbat will come and remain forever. %0a> %0a> Meanwhile, during the 6,000 years, the Creator elevates Malchut to Bina, and %0a> as a result, she receives Supernal Adornments, greater than the ones she had had %0a> in the world of AK. For there she acted as the end of all Sefirot, but now she has %0a> risen to act in the place of GAR, in AVI, which are called "holy of holies." %0a> %0a> If Malchut is in Yesod, the lack of Ohr Hochma is felt. But if Malchut ascends %0a> to AVI (where Ohr Hassadim is present, and there is absolutely no need for Ohr %0a> Hochma), this state is defined as perfect. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called "fear," for she was restricted to refrain from receiving the %0a> Creator's Light within her desire to receive pleasure. Therefore, she does not %0a> receive the Light from Above within her desire to receive pleasure. Instead, %0a> she receives the Light only in Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), when she refuses %0a> to use her egoism. %0a> %0a> This occurs in the following way: first, Ohr Yashar (Direct Light) comes from %0a> the Creator to Malchut and wishes to enter her (Malchut feels both the delight %0a> and her own desire to receive and enjoy it). Secondly, by wishing to be like the %0a> Creator, Malchut repels the Light (prohibits herself from receiving the delight). %0a> %0a> This renunciation of egoistic pleasure is called Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), %0a> because Malchut repels the Light (pleasure) from her. Thirdly, after Malchut %0a> has created Ohr Hozer, she begins to receive Ohr Yashar in it (her new desire %0a> to receive only because the Creator wants her to). This reception is possible %0a> because Malchut has an anti-egoistic force, will power, called a screen. %0a> %0a> The spiritual world is a realm of sensations, desires, and forces, not vested %0a> in shells-garments, like the corporeal bodies in our world. Similarly, all the %0a> characters depicted in Kabbalah do not designate any images; rather, they %0a> demonstrate interactions of forces and properties. %0a> %0a> Therefore, a circle implies that the Light shines completely unrestrictedly in %0a> every place and to the same extent, so there can be no change in its radiance. %0a> A square or a rectangle indicates restrictions, which create differences between %0a> the sides: right and left, top and bottom. Hence, the head has a round shape %0a> with regard to the rectangular shape of the body, for the Rosh (head) is free of %0a> restrictions, but VAK (body) are not. %0a> %0a> Shabbat is a spiritual state, when ZON ascend to AVI and clothe them. As %0a> a result, the lower Shabbat (ZON) and the Upper Shabbat (AVI) merge into one. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 230 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Upper Shabbat (AVI) is designated by a circle, and the lower Shabbat (ZON) %0a> is designated by a square. On Shabbat, ZON merge with AVI, depicted as the %0a> square's ascent and insertion into the circle. %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma is designated by the letter Ayin. Since Ohr Hochma is revealed %0a> only during the ascent of the lower Shabbat to the Upper, Ohr Hochma is %0a> divided into two parts: one half for the Upper Shabbat, and one for the lower. %0a> Hence, the passage of Vayechulu (Beresheet, 2:1) consists of thirty-five words %0a> that refer to half of the Light of the Upper Shabbat, whereas the blessing itself %0a> consists of thirty-five words that refer to half of the Light of the lower Shabbat. %0a> And the common soul, called the "Assembly of Israel" or Malchut (Shabbat), is %0a> adorned with this Light. %0a> %0a> Since the circle and the square merge and assume the name Shabbatot (two %0a> Shabbats), the Light of both the circle and the square is defined as protecting— %0a> GUARD. And, although the word GUARD alludes to restrictions and borders %0a> that one must observe and fear violating, whereas the Upper Shabbat (designated %0a> by a circle) has no restrictions and borders, due to the joining of the two Shabbatot %0a> into one, there still appeared restrictions and borders. %0a> %0a> The Upper Shabbat is called REMEMBER, and not OBSERVE, as it is %0a> completely free of restrictions. However, since it merged with the lower Shabbat, %0a> called OBSERVE, it, too, needs to GUARD, which normally relates to Malchut %0a> alone. Only due to Malchut 's ascent to Bina did the need to guard, which is %0a> present in Malchut, arose in Bina. But Bina herself remains only in the property of %0a> REMEMBER, for only egoistic desires to receive pleasure need GUARDING. %0a> %0a> The Upper Shabbat (Bina) is designated by the letters MI = Mem-Yod. The %0a> lower Shabbat (Malchut) is designated by the letters MA = Mem-Hey, and has the %0a> form of a square, which implies a presence of controversy between its properties— %0a> the right and the left sides, which give it its square form. %0a> %0a> 84. There are two types of peace below: one is Yaakov (Tifferet), and the other %0a> is Yosef (Yesod). Therefore, PEACE is written twice in the greeting: "PEACE, %0a> PEACE to the distant one and to the near one." "The distant one" refers to %0a> Yaakov, and "the near one" refers to Yosef. Or, as it is written, "From afar I %0a> see the Creator," "Came to a stop far in the distance." %0a> %0a> "Below" signifies ZON, containing one of the properties, Yaakov or the Sefira %0a> Tifferet de ZA. ZON also contain the property called Yosef, or Yesod. Both these %0a> Sefirot indicate the place of a potential Zivug between ZA and Maichut, for Peace %0a> signifies Zivug. The Upper Zivug (Yaakov) is intended for reception of Ohr Hochma %0a> from Above, and the lower Zivug (Yosef) fills Malchut only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 231 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It was already mentioned that it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma without %0a> it being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma or the Zivug that is made on it is %0a> therefore defined as distant, for it must first be clothed in Ohr Hassadim before %0a> it can receive Ohr Hochma. Hence, it is written, "From afar I saw the Creator." %0a> %0a> The lower Zivug is called "the near one," because the Partzuf receives Ohr %0a> Hassadim without any preliminary actions. Furthermore, with the help of this %0a> Ohr Hassadim, the Partzuf subsequently receives Ohr Hochma. This is why the %0a> word "peace" is used twice: "Peace, peace to the far and to the near"— a greeting %0a> to Yaakov and Yosef, respectively, both of whom take part in the great Zivug (the %0a> reception of Ohr Hochma) in ZA. %0a> %0a> These two greetings are defined in ZON as a square, as there is controversy %0a> between them, defined as the controversy between the right and the left sides, %0a> and they end in the letter Hey—Nukva or Malchut, whereas the Upper Nukva %0a> (Bina) ends with the letter Yod, which designates not the female part, but the %0a> male. Hence, there is no controversy in her. %0a> %0a> Even the notions of "near" and "far" do not exist in Bina herself, for %0a> she refers to GAR, perfection, and GAR can receive Ohr Hochma nearby, %0a> meaning they do not need to clothe in Ohr Hassadim beforehand, but can %0a> receive Ohr Hochma without Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it is said that the Upper %0a> Malchut is the King, who has peace. Thus, unlike ZON, two notions of peace %0a> are absent in him. %0a> %0a> 85. "From afar" is the Supernal Point, standing in His palace, of which it is said, %0a> "You are to guard." "You shall fear My sanctity" refers to the point standing %0a> in the center, which must be feared more than anything, for its punishment %0a> is death, as it is written, "All who transgress in it shall perish." Who are these %0a> transgressors? They are those who have entered the space of the circle and the %0a> square, and committed a sin. Hence, it is written, "You shall fear!" This point %0a> is called "I," and there is a prohibition on its revelation, called HaVaYaH. "I" %0a> and HaVaYaH are a single whole. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted %0a> from their donkeys and kissed him. They said, "So great is your wisdom, and %0a> yet you drive donkeys behind us! Who are you, then?" He replied to them: %0a> "Do not ask me who I am, but let us go on and study the Torah. Each of us %0a> will speak his wisdom so as to illuminate our path." %0a> %0a> The distant point refers to the point that opens the way to the Partzuf for %0a> thirty-two streams of Ohr Hochma. And this is the letter Bet in the first word %0a> of the Torah— Beresheet, called the "point in the hall," from which Ohr Hochma %0a> descends to ZON, when ZON ascend to AVI. For then, the two Shabbatot (the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 232 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Upper— AVI and the lower— ZON) merge. It is written about them: "I saw the %0a> Creator from afar," for ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma without being clothed %0a> in Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Hochma and Bina, called the "point in the hall," are referred to as "distant %0a> from ZON," for they need the garment of Ohr Hassadim from the lower world, %0a> Nulcva, called MA. Malchut of the world of AK is the central point, called the %0a> "lock," whereas Malchut of the world of Atzilut (the point in the hall) is the %0a> "key," as the Light from ZATde Bina (YESHSUT) can be received in it. %0a> %0a> The circle is called AVI, the square— ZON. ZON ascend to AVI and thus %0a> the square enters the circle. As a result, two properties appear in Malchut of %0a> AVI: the "lock" (Malchut de Malchut, the central point or Malchut de AVI), and %0a> the "key" (the point in the hall, Yesod de Malchut or Malchut de YESHSUT). %0a> Malchut de AVI is called space, for she is unattainable, and he who wishes to %0a> fill her with Light is punished by death. It is written about it: "You shall fear %0a> My sanctity." %0a> %0a> The point itself is called "I," and AVI is HaVaYaH that merges with it. And %0a> they are defined as a single whole; hence, the point itself is referred to as AVI, %0a> meaning that it is characterized as holy, as the property of AVI. %0a> %0a> As was already mentioned before, The Zohar and the entire Torah speak %0a> exclusively of spiritual degrees, the structure of spiritual worlds, and the %0a> revelation of the Creator's governance to us. There is not a word in the Torah %0a> that refers to our world. The whole Torah is, as it is said, "The Creator's sacred %0a> names." And those who reduce it from its spiritual heights to the corporeal level %0a> their commentaries cast it down completely. %0a> %0a> Rashi says that the Torah only speaks in human tongue, but it tells us of man's %0a> spiritual paths toward his Creator. Therefore, when we read that one Rabbi went %0a> to visit another, the real meaning is that one spiritual degree, called, for example, %0a> Rabbi Elazar, passes to another spiritual degree, called, for example, Rabbi Yosi. %0a> %0a> ZA has his own AVI, who are called the Upper AVI. The wife of ZA (Nukva %0a> or Malchut) contains AVI, too, called YESHSUT. First, ZA attains the AVI of his %0a> wife (YESHSUT or Ohr Hassadim). Then it rises to a Higher Degree and attains %0a> the AVI themselves— Ohr Hochma (also called Ohr Haya). %0a> %0a> The righteous who ascend the spiritual degrees are the constituents of %0a> Partzuf ZA. Since the degree of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba is Ohr Hassadim (the %0a> Light of Neshama), this ascent means it went to (spiritually) see (in Ohr Hochma) %0a> another spiritual degree. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 233 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In the spiritual worlds, the donkey driver constitutes a special spiritual force %0a> that helps the souls of the righteous move from one spiritual degree to another. %0a> Without this help sent by the Creator from Above, it is impossible to exit your %0a> degree and ascend to the next. Hence, the Creator sends a Higher soul from %0a> Above to each of the righteous (those who wish to ascend). Each receives his %0a> own, according to his degree, properties, and purpose. %0a> %0a> And so, at first the righteous fails to recognize this exalted soul; he %0a> considers it low, that it leeched onto him on his spiritual path. Such state %0a> is called Ibur— conception of the righteous' soul. Since the Higher soul has %0a> not yet completed its assistance and purpose, it is not yet perceived by the %0a> righteous for what it really is. %0a> %0a> However, after it completes its task in its entirety, and brings the righteous' %0a> soul to the Upper Degree for which it is intended, the righteous then reveals %0a> the exalted properties of the soul that helped him. This is referred to as the %0a> revelation of the soul to the righteous. %0a> %0a> In our case, the soul that was sent to help the souls of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a> Aba was the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba— a very exalted and perfect soul, the %0a> Light of Yechida. Yet, initially, it is revealed to the righteous in its smallest scope, %0a> called Ibur, conception (in sensations). Hence, they perceive it as the level of a %0a> spiritual donkey driver— a simple soul. %0a> %0a> The Hebrew word for donkey is Hamor, which also means matter, Homer] %0a> Thus, one who can control his donkey, his body, his desires, ascends above matter %0a> as a spiritual being. And since he wishes to ascend above matter in his desires, he %0a> is considered a righteous. However, here, The Zohar speaks of Higher Degrees. %0a> %0a> The donkey driver's task is to take the riders, mounted atop of their donkeys, %0a> from place to place; yet, he walks in front of his donkeys, thereby leading them %0a> through spiritual degrees. Since every word in the Torah has several meanings, %0a> due to the multiplicity of the Upper Roots (wherefrom word notions descend), %0a> the notion of a "donkey driver" is more precisely referred to as a "donkey guide," %0a> and implies properties that are coarse, sinful, and most base. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Rabbi Aba said: "Let us open the gates of the Torah, for the time %0a> has come for us to correct our path," that is, to open their souls with the help %0a> of the secrets of the Torah, so their path would be correct and lead them to %0a> the Creator. Rabbi Elazar then began to discuss a passage from the Torah that %0a> says, "You shall observe my Shabbatot," as he stood at this degree (the Light of %0a> YESHSUT) in his properties. He therefore concluded that Shabbat itself is the %0a> property of ZON, which has not yet reached the property of sanctity, but only %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 234 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> receives the Light of YESHSUT on Shabbat. It is written about this Light, "You %0a> shall fear my sanctity," for when Ohr Hochma passes from YESHSUT to ZA, it %0a> evokes fear in them. %0a> %0a> And here they receive the donkey driver's help, who reveals to them the %0a> secret of Ohr Haya. He explains that the phrase "You shall observe my Shabbatot" %0a> signifies the Upper and the lower Shabbatot, which come together, due to the %0a> ascent of ZON to AVI. As a result, ZON themselves become holy (the square %0a> within the circle) and acquire the properties of Bina: mercy, altruism, Ohr %0a> Hassadim. Hence, it is written with regard to them: fear not and observe. For %0a> Ohr Haya repels foreign, impure forces and desires, and all restrictions are lifted %0a> on Shabbat; hence, there is no fear. %0a> %0a> And, according to the donkey driver's explanation, the phrase "You shall %0a> fear My sanctity" refers only to the central point that is used in GAR de AVI, in %0a> GAR of Ohr Haya, which is unattainable and where fear does exist. %0a> %0a> At that, the soul of the donkey driver has fulfilled its role, for it brought %0a> them to the attainment of Ohr Haya. Only then did they merit the attainment %0a> of the height of the soul that had helped them, since they attained its revelation %0a> and were thus able to appreciate it. %0a> %0a> This is why Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted from their donkeys %0a> and kissed him, for the attainment of the Upper One is defined as a "kiss." %0a> However, this exalted soul has not yet finished aiding them: it must still help %0a> them attain Ohr Yechida. Yet, since the attainment of Ohr Haya already provides %0a> perfection, they've already attained thereby the degree of the son of Rabbi %0a> Hamnuna-Saba. %0a> %0a> The level of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself is the degree of attainment %0a> of Ohr Yechida. Therefore, by attaining only Ohr Haya, they mistakenly %0a> thought that the soul guiding them belongs to the son of Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a> Saba. However, after the donkey driver had revealed to them the secret of the %0a> attainment of Ohr Yechida, they realized that their companion is none other %0a> than Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself. %0a> %0a> And the reason why they could not recognize him before is that the powers %0a> of the helping soul cannot be seen until its role is fulfilled. Hence, they asked %0a> him to reveal his name, but he told them not to inquire about his name, for %0a> without having completed all the corrections, they do not merit the revelation %0a> of the secrets of the Torah. And he must help them in their studies of the %0a> Torah, for he still needs to illuminate their path, as they have not yet attained %0a> the desired goal. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 235 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 86. He said to him: "Who appointed you to walk here and be a donkey driver?" %0a> He replied: "The letter Yod waged war with two letters, Chaf and Samech, for %0a> me to come and join. The letter Chaf did not want to leave its place because it %0a> has to support those who fall, for without a screen, they cannot survive." %0a> %0a> 87. The letter Yod came to me alone, kissed me and wept with me. It said to %0a> me, "My son, what can I do for you? I disappear from many good deeds and %0a> from secret, supernal, basic letters. But I shall return to you and will be of %0a> help to you. And I shall give you two letters that are more exalted than those %0a> that have disappeared— the letters Yod and Shin. They shall become for you a %0a> treasury that is forever full. So, my son, go and drive the donkeys. And that is %0a> why I am here in this role." %0a> %0a> As we already know, the donkey driver is an auxiliary force given to someone %0a> who wishes to ascend to a higher spiritual degree on his path toward the Creator, %0a> just as donkeys carry people on their backs, thereby helping them travel from %0a> one place to another. As this happens, the righteous one falls from his previous %0a> degree and enters the embryonic state of the new degree, just as the soul that %0a> came to help him. However, the property of Ibur-embryo (lbur is also derived %0a> from the word Haavarah, crossing) means that all the Light that it had in the %0a> previous degree disappears upon the conception (lbur) of a new, Higher Degree. %0a> %0a> And that is what they wanted to know of the donkey driver: "How did the %0a> Creator bring you here in the state of lbur, in our state of lbur, as a result of which %0a> the Light in us has disappeared? Who lowers you from the Higher Degrees?" %0a> And that is why the donkey driver replied that the letter Yod waged war against %0a> the letters Chaf and Samech, to join with them. The degree of Hassadim is called %0a> Samech (Ohr Neshama). %0a> %0a> "When the time has come for you to attain Ohr Haya (Yod from HaVaYaH, %0a> the degree from which I descended to help you to attain Ohr Haya), Hochma %0a> really wanted to connect Ohr Neshama (that was previously in you) to me. And %0a> here Yod wages war against Chaf and Samech. Malchut of the Upper Partzuf %0a> clothes in the lower Partzuf, designated by the letter Chaf. There used to be Ohr %0a> Neshama, and now there is Ohr Haya, whereas Yod, which desires Ohr Neshama %0a> as well, merges with it, and rejects the Chaf." %0a> %0a> This is so because the connection between the degrees, from the Highest %0a> Degree in the world of Atzilut to the end of the world of Assiya, is realized only %0a> by Malchut of the Upper One descending to the lower one and clothing in it. %0a> Malchut of the Upper One herself cannot descend from her degree of YESHSUT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 236 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (the degree of Neshama) even for a moment, as the chain connecting the degrees %0a> would be instantly broken. %0a> %0a> The property of Samech is the property of the Light itself, which the soul %0a> receives from Sefirot HBD HGT of AVI (above the Cha^eh), and which AVI pass %0a> to ZON when the letters are in Katnut, and support them (the Hebrew word for %0a> support is Somech, derived from the letter Samech) so that ZON will not fall from %0a> the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> The letter Chaf, Hassadim, is unwilling to leave its place and join Hochma, %0a> as it needs to connect the Upper Partzuf to the lower one. Thus, it must always %0a> remain in its place, for all the degrees are constant, and only the soul changes %0a> while moving from one degree to another within the worlds. This is why the %0a> soul is called the "inner part" with regard to the world (the external part)— the %0a> soul exists and moves about within the world by changing its properties. %0a> %0a> Hence, the Light of the soul did not wish to join the letter Yod (degree of %0a> Hochma, the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba) as it descended to help Rabbi Elazar %0a> and Rabbi Aba. This is because they needed a new Light that would build a new %0a> degree within them, the degree of Ohr Haya, whereas each new degree is built from %0a> scratch, from the state of Ibur (conception). As that happens, the entire previous %0a> degree with all of its Light disappears. Similarly, in their case, the new degree %0a> starts with Ibur and reaches the level of Haya. This resembles a seed that must %0a> first abandon its present form and rot, in order to become a tree afterwards. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written that it came to me without the Light of HBD HGT %0a> de AVI, called Samech, the Light of Hassadim. Samech is the property of mercy, a %0a> selfless desire to give, pure spiritual altruism. Hence, it is unwilling to join Yod, %0a> Ohr Hochma. Yet, Ohr Hochma cannot enter and fill the Partzuf without first %0a> being clothed in Ohr Hassadim, for this clothing of Ohr Hochma in Ohr Hassadim %0a> means that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma not for itself, but for the Creator's %0a> sake. But Ohr Hassadim, Samech, does not wish to receive anything within itself; %0a> it wants nothing to do with Ohr Hochma] This is why the letter Yod wept, being %0a> unable to fill the Partzuf with its Light, for Hassadim refused to accept Hochma. %0a> %0a> It is written in this regard: Hence, I must now disappear, and you, the donkey %0a> driver, go to the state of Ibur, to rebuild the degrees of gradual development of %0a> a new Part?u/-state with you: Ibur (embryo), Leidah (birth), Yenika (nursing), and %0a> Mochin (maturity). %0a> %0a> And know that such is the order of creating (begetting) each new degree: %0a> every time one is to attain a new degree, he must undergo (in his properties) a %0a> complete disappearance of the previous degree (level of attainment, Light), and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 237 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> begin anew. He must receive new attainments, from the lowest new degree, Ohr %0a> Nefesh (Ibur), to Ohr Ruach (Yenika), and so on, as though he had never attained %0a> any spiritual level at all. %0a> %0a> It is impossible to take with you anything from a previous degree. Hence, one %0a> must start anew from the lowest level of Ibur, called THE DONKEY DRIVER. %0a> Ohr Haya de AVI is called YESH (Yod-Shin), where Yod is Hochma and Shin is Bina. %0a> And, of course, they are more important than the Ohr Neshama that was in the %0a> Partzuf before them. %0a> %0a> 88. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba rejoiced, wept, and said, "You sit on the %0a> donkey, and we shall drive it." He replied to them, "Have I not told you that %0a> it is the command of the King that I act as I do, until the other donkey driver %0a> appears" (this hints at the Mashiach, who, as it is said, will appear poor and %0a> riding a donkey). They said to him, "You have not even told us your name! %0a> Where do you dwell?" He told them, "My dwelling place is wonderful %0a> and very precious to me. It is a tower that soars in the air, grand and unique. %0a> Only two live in this tower: the Creator and I. That is the place, in which %0a> I dwell. And I am exiled from there in order to drive the donkeys." Rabbi %0a> Elazar and Rabbi Aba looked at him, and his words were unclear to them, for %0a> they tasted sweeter than manna and honey. They said to him, "Perhaps you %0a> will tell us the name of your father, so that we could kiss the earth at his feet?" %0a> He responded, "What for? It is not my habit to boast of the Torah." %0a> %0a> After they have attained the greatness of the donkey driver's degree, they %0a> could no longer bear his small state of Ibur, which he inhabited for their sake. %0a> Hence, they told him that since they have already attained Ohr Hochma, he has %0a> done enough and can leave the state of Ibur. And should a need arise to add %0a> anything else to them, they would be able to enter Ibur on their own, and he %0a> does not need to suffer for their sake. %0a> %0a> However, the donkey driver warned them beforehand to not ask him his %0a> name, for they still require revelations of secrets of the Torah. Once again, he %0a> hinted that it is the degree of Ohr Yechida that they lack, which is implied here. %0a> This degree signifies the reception of the Light of the King Messiah's face, %0a> which he mentioned by hinting at the poor donkey driver, as described by a %0a> prophet (Zachariah, 9:9). And he is commanded by the Creator to help them %0a> attain Ohr Yechida. %0a> %0a> This is why they asked him about the type of his soul: "For you did not wish %0a> to reveal your name, as we have not yet received from you that which we must %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 238 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> attain. But if so, at least tell us where you live, what is your degree? At least then %0a> we will know what we lack, what else we must receive, attain from you." %0a> %0a> He replied that his place is much higher than his present location, for now %0a> he himself cannot attain his own individual level. This is a result of the Upper %0a> Partzuf descending to the place of the lower one and becoming completely %0a> identical to it, and while there (in that state), the Upper Partzuf can no longer %0a> attain its own level. The tower that soars in the air is Bina, Hassadim. The %0a> Mashiach's tower (the great tower) designates the time (state) of ascent to GAR de %0a> AA, when Ohr Hochma is available. %0a> %0a> 89. But the place of my father's dwelling was in the Great Sea. And he was %0a> a big fish that continually circled the Great Sea, from one end to the other. %0a> And he was mighty and he grew old, until he swallowed up all the other fish %0a> in that sea. And then he released them, and they were thriving and filled %0a> with all of the very best of the world. And it was in his power to swim across %0a> the entire sea in one instant. And He pulled him out and hauled him in %0a> with an arrow, like a warrior, and brought him to the place that I told you %0a> about, to the tower that soars in the air, but he returned to his place and %0a> disappeared in that sea. %0a> %0a> The concealed Zivug is called Shaar HaNun (the 50 th gate). The Great Sea is %0a> Malchut. All the Zivugim from Partzuf Atik de Atzilut and below do not include %0a> the Great Sea in its entirety, all the Sefirot of Malchut, but only the first nine %0a> Sefirot of Malchut. Moreover, none of the Zivugim include Malchut de Malchut. %0a> %0a> This Sefira, Malchut de Malchut, is the only creation, because all the other %0a> Sefirot constitute properties of spiritual forces and desires above Malchut, existing %0a> in and referring to the Creator, the sole purpose of which is the correction of %0a> Malchut de Malchut. The only Zivug on this Malchut exists in Atik, and it will be %0a> revealed to all only at the end of correction. %0a> %0a> Rav Hamnuna-Saba emerged from this concealed Zivug in Atik; hence, the %0a> donkey driver calls him "my father." And he says that his father lived in the %0a> Great Sea, as this Zivug was on the entire Malchut, on Malchut de Malchut, called %0a> the "Great Sea." %0a> %0a> Yet, if one were to argue that all Partzufim make a Zivug on the Light with %0a> a screen that stands before Malchut, then that Zivug was made on the 50 th gate, %0a> on all the parts of the desire, on the full depth of the Great Sea (Malchut), down %0a> to the very last of her desires and properties, from Keter de Malchut to Malchut %0a> de Malchut, from end to end of the Great Sea. Nevertheless, this occurs only %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 239 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, but not below it. And this is not the donkey driver %0a> himself, but his father. %0a> %0a> This occurs because the great Zivug absorbs all the other particular Zivugim %0a> ("swallows all the other fish in the Great Sea") and all the souls in all the worlds, %0a> for they are all much weaker than it. Hence, it is as though they do not exist in %0a> its greatness and might. And since it includes absolutely everything, they are all %0a> called by the name Nunin, from the letter Nun (50). %0a> %0a> This indicates that after all the major corrections that follow this great Zivug, %0a> all those Lights and souls, absorbed during its Zivug, return and are born anew %0a> for eternal life, for they are completely filled with Light as a result of the great %0a> Zivug, when the Light absorbed them completely. %0a> %0a> All the Zivugim below Partzuf Atik stem from unifications of the Sefirot with %0a> one another. These unifications are defined as interruptions in a Zivug, whereas %0a> the Zivug in Atik is direct and without unification. Thus, it is defined as "instant," %0a> for it goes on uninterrupted. It is therefore written that "he crosses the entire %0a> sea in an instant," without any garments-unifications. And it mounts an attack, %0a> for there is great power of reception of Ohr Hochma in this Zivug; hence, he said: %0a> "Begets, like an arrow in the hands of a warrior." %0a> %0a> It is written of this Zivug in Partzuf Atik: "No one else but you saw the %0a> Creator." However, no birth is possible without the forces of resistance, since, %0a> as is written: "The seed that is not shot like an arrow does not beget." (Talmud, %0a> Hagigah, 16). Hence, after he had begotten me and hid me in the Great Tower, %0a> he returned to his concealed Zivug. %0a> %0a> 90. Rabbi Elazar contemplated his words and replied: "You are the son of the %0a> Holy Source, you are the son of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, you are the son of the %0a> Source of the Torah, and you drive donkeys behind us!" They wept and kissed %0a> him, and continued their journey. Then he said: "If it pleases our master, let %0a> him reveal his name to us." %0a> %0a> It is written "looked," because sight signifies Hochma, and no other words, %0a> such as "said," "heard" (Bina) or "thought" could be used in its stead. Since they %0a> have not yet attained to the full extent of perfection what the donkey driver %0a> had told them, and their attainment reached only as high as Ohr Haya, they %0a> were delighted with what was begotten by Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, for Rabbi %0a> Hamnuna-Saba is Ohr Yechida. %0a> %0a> He asked him to reveal his name, that is, to receive his degree, for the %0a> attainment of a name denotes the attainment of the spiritual degree. Therefore, %0a> the saying, "the entire Torah consists only of the Creator's names," means that the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 240 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> entire Torah constitutes the degrees that one must attain, up to the very highest, %0a> called "Love" ("Introduction to The Study of the Ten Sefirot," items 70-71). %0a> %0a> Each degree in the attainment of the Upper Worlds has its own name. All %0a> the Creator's names: Moshe, Pharaoh, Avraham, the Temple, Sinai— every single %0a> word in the Torah— are degrees of perception of the Creator, degrees of attaining %0a> Him, for nothing exists besides man and his Creator. Everything else that exists %0a> in the world, as it seems to us, are the various degrees of our perception of the %0a> Creator Himself. He may appear to us as this world, and He may appear as the %0a> world of Assiya, as Yetzira, Beria, Atzilut, or He may be revealed completely, without %0a> partial concealments of the spiritual world or total concealment of our world. %0a> Thus, the word Olam (world) is derived from the Haalamah (concealment). %0a> %0a> 91. He opened and began. It is written, "Benayahu (Benaiah) Ben (the son %0a> of) Yehoyada (Jehoiada)." This narrative is beautiful, but it serves to show %0a> us the exalted secrets of the Torah. And the name Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada %0a> indicates the secret of the Light of Wisdom, Ohr Hochma. Ben Ish Choi %0a> is the righteous who revives the worlds. Rav Paalim means that He is the %0a> Master of all that transpires, and that all the forces and Supernal Troops %0a> stem from Him. He is called the Creator of Force, the Master of all, and He %0a> is in everything. %0a> %0a> It is written in Prophets: "Benayahu, the son of Yehoyada," (Shmuel II, %0a> 23:20). Here, The Zohar reveals to us the exalted secrets of the Torah, for the %0a> holy name of Yehoyada consists of two: Yod-Hey-Vav, the first three letters of %0a> HaVaYaH, and Yeda (knowledge). %0a> %0a> Keter of the world of Atzilut is called RADLA (unattainable head), whereas %0a> Atik itself surrounds all the other Partzufim of the world of Atzilut— AA, AVI, and %0a> ZON. Atik is called Makif (surrounding), for the other, lower Partzufim cannot %0a> attain it or its Zivug. Moreover, they cannot attain anything that comes from it. %0a> In other words, there is nothing descending from Atik to the lower Partzufim. %0a> Even AA is concealed from them; hence, it is called the "concealed Hochma." %0a> However, it is not defined as unattainable, like Atik, for it contains a Zivug on %0a> Ohr Hochma. Nevertheless, this Light does not descend to the lower ones, but %0a> only a small luminescence from it, called He'arat Hochma, reaches them. %0a> %0a> And all the Light that fills the worlds through the 6,000 years comes from %0a> AVI and YESHSUT, who are called Hochma of the thirty-two paths or thirty-two %0a> forces (Elokim) of creation, i.e., thirty-two types of He'arat Hochma. This Light of %0a> Hochma is the result of Bina's ascent to AA, where she receives Ohr Hochma and %0a> shines downward. Therefore, all the Light of Hochma that is revealed through %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 241 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the 6,000 years, before the end of correction, is no more than the Light of Bina, %0a> which received Ohr Hochma upon ascending to AA. %0a> %0a> AA is called Yeda (knowledge) because it gives Ohr Hochma to Bina, and %0a> knows all the routes of Ohr Hochma into Bina and through her on to the lower %0a> ones. While making a Zivug, AA itself does not pass its Light downwards, but %0a> as AVI ascend to AA, they receive Ohr Hochma, called "thirty-two streams" or %0a> "paths of wisdom," which can be attained by the lower ones. %0a> %0a> Everything that is written in The Zohar refers to all the souls in general. %0a> However, there are exceptions that are not normally studied. There exist special, %0a> exalted souls that merit becoming a Kli, MAN for the great Zivug of RADLA %0a> after their exile, and to receive from this Zivug in the Upper World the degree %0a> of Yechida. These are the souls of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a> Saba and a very few chosen others. These exalted souls reveal themselves to the %0a> righteous in this world, and as a result, the righteous merit delighting in Ohr %0a> Yechida, which shines only in such exalted souls, while still being in this world. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the name of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada indicates that it stems from %0a> the inner wisdom, the unattainable Light of Hochma of Atik. This name also %0a> causes the concealment of the Light of Hochma, for the name Yehoyada: Yod-Hey- %0a> Vav + Yeda means that only he who attains the first three letters Yod-Hey-Vav of %0a> the Creator's name HaVaYaH shall attain Him, and no other shall. %0a> %0a> Therefore, this name remains concealed in its place. At first, the donkey %0a> driver explains the quality of this Zivug in Atik— its height, the power of the Light %0a> that emerges onto it in Rosh de Atik, which the name of this Zivug, "Ben hh Chai %0a> Rav Paalim ve Mekabtziel," indicates. And then he explains what is concealed and %0a> what descends to the souls. %0a> %0a> It was already stated that this Zivug takes place at the end of the correction of %0a> the entire Malchut. Hence, it includes all the individual Zivugim and the degrees %0a> that emerge on them through the 6,000 years. All the Lights accumulate into %0a> one. All the types of MAN combine into one and ascend to ask for this Zivug, %0a> which includes all the suffering and punishments gradually accumulated during %0a> the 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> Hence, the height and greatness of this Zivug and the degree of Light that %0a> emerges from it are infinite, and it destroys all the impure forces once and for %0a> all. Yesod de ZA, from which the Light of this Zivug (the combination of all the %0a> Lights over the full course of the 6,000 years) is emanated, is called "hh Chai Rav %0a> Paalim"— a vivid man of many actions. However, Malchut, which contains within %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 242 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> her all the MAN, suffering, and work performed during the 6,000 years, is called %0a> Mekabtziel (gathering one). %0a> %0a> The Zohar also calls it Tzadik Chai Olamim— the righteous, who revives the %0a> worlds, for it thereby points to the Sefira Yesod, which gives the Light to Malchut. %0a> The Sefira Yesod does not have a place to receive the Light for itself. Hence, it %0a> lives (Chai) only to pass the Light to Malchut. This is why it is called Tzadik (the %0a> righteous one), who revives the worlds (Chai Olamim). %0a> %0a> Its other name, Rav Paalim (performing many actions) indicates that %0a> it includes all the MAD of all the good deeds and all the degrees that were %0a> revealed through the 6,000 years. This is because all these degrees are now being %0a> revealed all at once in a cumulative, integrated Light, as they leave Yesod and %0a> enter Malchut. And since Yesod now gathers all the Light that was emanated %0a> during the 6,000 years into one, and passes it to Malchut, this action determines %0a> its name— Rav Paalim. %0a> %0a> 92. Rav Paalim is also Mekabtziel— the Exalted Tree, gathering and %0a> performing many actions, Supreme Above all. Where did it come from? %0a> From which degree did it originate? Once more, the source indicates— from %0a> Mekabtziel, for it is an exalted and concealed degree that none has seen. %0a> It includes everything, for it gathers all of the Upper Light within it, and %0a> everything originates from it. %0a> %0a> Malchut-Nukva is also named Mekabtziel, for she receives and gathers all the %0a> Light from Yesod within herself. Hence, Yesod is called Rav Paalim. The degree %0a> that emerges onto this Zivug is called the "Supreme and Exalted Tree" that %0a> originated from Yesod and entered Malchut. The Zohar goes on to explain that to %0a> show us the quality and the origin of this exalted degree, the name Mekabtziel %0a> (gathering) is used; Yesod accumulates the Upper Light and passes it to Nukva. %0a> And both Yesod and Malchut are called Mekabtziel %0a> %0a> And the degree that emerges onto this Zivug of Yesod and Malchut is called %0a> "None but you has seen the Creator." This degree emerges after the complete %0a> correction has been achieved, at the moment of attachment of the final correction %0a> that completes them all. Therefore, this degree is defined as all-inclusive, for it %0a> collects all the Light over the full course of 6,000 years, and thereby manifests at %0a> once in its true perfection. %0a> %0a> 93. All of the degrees gather in this Supernal, Sacred, and Concealed Hall, %0a> where everything is concealed. All of the worlds are inside that hall. All the %0a> holy forces are sustained and revived by it, and all are dependant on it. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 243 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar speaks of Rosh de Atik, where all the degrees and all the Light %0a> of all the worlds are concentrated and concealed. It further explains how this %0a> Zivug can occur up to the final correction, so it would combine all the degrees %0a> emerging one after another during the 6,000 years. And it would emerge instantly %0a> during the 6,000 years of the world's existence, when the degrees are in a state of %0a> constant ascents and descents, for as soon as a new degree, a new attainment of %0a> the Creator, of the Light, is revealed, the present degree disappears. This occurs %0a> due to the sin of the lower ones, who cannot retain this degree permanently %0a> (world— Olam, from the word Haalamah— concealment. The complete revelation %0a> of the Creator to His Creatures will take place at the end of the 6,000 years; %0a> thus, the world-concealment will cease to exist). %0a> %0a> So, whenever a degree disappears, it does so only from the sensation of one %0a> who attains a new degree. In reality, this degree ascends to Rosh de Atik and hides %0a> there, so as to, by joining other degrees, be manifested at the end of correction. %0a> %0a> In the same way, Atik gathers all the degrees revealed in the world during %0a> the 6,000 years, and conceals them within itself until the time of the end of %0a> correction comes; WHEN IT CORRECTS THE LAST PORTION OF WHAT %0a> IT MUST CORRECT, AND THUS CANNOT NO LONGER SIN. AND IT %0a> NO LONGER NEEDS TO SIN TO CORRECT THE NEXT PORTION OF %0a> EGOISM; HENCE, THIS FINAL DEGREE REMAINS PERMANENTLY %0a> AND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR. Then, Atik gathers all the degrees, and they all %0a> manifest simultaneously. %0a> %0a> Everyone has his own Partzuf Atik. How can one accelerate his advancement %0a> long the degrees of correction in this world and in the spiritual worlds? It if %0a> ritten in the Talmud that an old man bends as he walks, as if he's looking %0a> jmething that he had lost. %0a> %0a> An old man symbolizes someone of wisdom, Hochma, for even without ha %0a> lost anything, he looks beforehand for things he can correct in himself, and %0a> finds them. Hence, he does not require the previous degree of attainment to %0a> disappear from him. And if one does not discover new egoistic properties in %0a> need of correction within him, his previous degree disappears and a new one %0a> begins. However, this process is considerably slower than when one acts like %0a> old man in search of shortcomings. %0a> %0a> Throughout the 6,000 years, Atik is defined as unattainable. Therefore, its %0a> head is called RADLA (an abbreviation for the Aramaic words, Reisha de Lo %0a> Etiada, the "unattainable head"), whereas the name Atik is derived from the %0a> word Ne'etak (isolated) from the lower ones, for it does not shine upon them. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 244 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> And, although it accumulates within all the Lights that emerge from it itself and %0a> become revealed in the lower worlds, the Light of the end of correction remains %0a> concealed nonetheless. It follows that after each degree disappears due to the %0a> sins of the lower ones, it ascends to Rosh de Atik and conceals itself there. %0a> %0a> However, Guf de Atik, from its Peh downward, is located inside all the other %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, i.e., it is attainable by them. Thus, by clothing %0a> in the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, Atik shines through them and gives the %0a> Light to them and to all the lower worlds of BYA. And any Light that shines on %0a> creation during the 6,000 years comes only from Guf de Atik, and not from some %0a> other spiritual object. %0a> %0a> We usually say that whatever is present in the Rosh of a Partzuf manifests in %0a> its Guf. This is also true with regard to all the Partzufim of the world of AK and %0a> all the other Partzufim in all the worlds, except in Partzuf Atik! This is so because %0a> Atik remains in Tzimtzum Aleph and descends down to our world. However, with %0a> regard to other Partzufim below it, Atik acts as though it is in T^imt^um Bet, making %0a> a special Zivug on itself and the Light from it descends to the lower worlds. %0a> %0a> The Light that comes to revive the worlds is called "sustenance" or Ohr %0a> Hassadim, and the Light that comes to stimulate the growth of the Partzufim, %0a> to turn a small Partzuf (Katnut) into a big one (Gadlut) is called Ohr Hochma. %0a> Both these Lights originate in Guf de Atik. Ohr Hochma, which makes a Partzuf %0a> big, is called the Light that elevates the Partzuf, for the lying position is called %0a> Ibur (embryo), the sitting position is called Katnut (small), and the standing %0a> position— Gadlut (big). %0a> %0a> 94. He slew two— Ariel and Moav (Moab). Two Holy Temples existed thanks %0a> to Atik and received from it: the First Temple and the Second Temple. Since %0a> Atik's disappearance, the process that stemmed from Above had ceased. It is %0a> as though he struck and destroyed them. %0a> %0a> Only Malchut de Malchut must be corrected, and nothing else. All the other %0a> properties do not require correction. This Malchut de Malchut is Malchut of Olam %0a> Ein Sof (the World of Infinity), Behina Dalet, Nukva de ZA or Partzuf BON— the %0a> Creator's only creation, the will to receive (pleasure) for oneself. It is this desire %0a> that caused the breaking of the Kelim (vessels)— the sin of Adam. %0a> %0a> And all the work of the righteous during the 6,000 years concerns the %0a> correction of Malchut, so she becomes precisely as she was prior to the breaking %0a> of the Kelim and the sin of Adam. As a result, the great Zivug on T^imt^um Aleph %0a> in Rosh de Atik will be revealed. The Light of this Zivug enables man to sort and %0a> separate his impure desires from the pure ones, and thus forever rid himself of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 245 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the impure egoistic forces. This is exactly what Prophet Yeshayahu writes about: %0a> "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a> %0a> Since Malchut, Partzuf BON of the world of Atzilut, is completely corrected %0a> already and does not require any further corrections, her Partzuf BON ascends %0a> to the level of Partzuf SAG of the world of AK. Thus, Malchut completely attains %0a> the properties of Bina. %0a> %0a> However, meanwhile, after the great Zivug in Atilc, but before the ascent of %0a> Partzuf BON to SAG, the Light of Atilc stops shining. As a result, the two Temples %0a> were destroyed. The two temples are the two Lights of Hochma: the Light of AVI, %0a> Ohr Hochma de Haya that shines in the First Temple, and the Light of YESHSUT, %0a> Ohr Neshama that shines in the Second Temple. And all the Light that Israel %0a> received from Atilc disappears. %0a> %0a> However, all these destructions and disappearances of Light are corrections %0a> and milestones on the path to deliverance and complete correction. They signify %0a> not devastation, but creation of perfection, as they are precisely those final %0a> corrections that bring BON back to SAG. %0a> %0a> Since all the roots and sources of what transpires in this world exist in the %0a> spiritual realm, and must all manifest once in our world, every spiritual ro %0a> must "touch" its branch in our world, and it does not matter when this oo %0a> In the spiritual world, everything unfolds in accordance with a strict cause-an %0a> effect process, whereas in our world those same consequences can manifest at a %0a> completely different time. %0a> %0a> An example of this is the destruction of the First and the Second Temples. %0a> While this event has already transpired in our world, in the spiritual world it %0a> occurs only when the last stage of correction is attained. Due to the complexity %0a> of time-transcending notions, we will examine this matter in another book. %0a> However, one way or another, only our inner spiritual properties can become the %0a> Temple in which we will feel the Creator and in which He will forever dwell! %0a> %0a> At the end of correction, Ohr Haya and Ohr Neshama will be called the %0a> First and the Second Temples, respectively. Also, until the end of correction, %0a> Ohr Haya, which is received on the Zivug of Malchut and included in Yesod, is %0a> led Shahhat (Sabbath), while Ohr Neshama is called Hoi (weekdays). As wi %0a> ere is absolutely no connection between these Lights and the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> After the destruction of the spiritual Temples (the disappearance of Light), %0a> they will be recreated from Above by the screen of Bina, called "Heaven." This is %0a> because the screen of Partzuf SAG is a property of absolute mercy and is completely %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 246 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> unrestricted in its actions, desiring only to bestow and refrain from receiving Ohr %0a> Hochma. Thus, it is beyond the influence of any restrictions and limitations. %0a> %0a> As a result of this Zivug, the two Temples will be restored forever, and "the %0a> Light of the Moon (Malchut) shall be as the Light of the Sun (Bina)" (Yeshayahu, %0a> 30:26). The Light of Bina, which is now the Light of ZA (called "the sun"), %0a> will be seven times more powerful, as ZAT de Atik. From there, this Light will %0a> descend to AVI and create the first seven days of creation, for ZA (the sun) will %0a> become like AB and contain the Light of Guf de Atik. Malchut will become like %0a> ZA and receive his Light, the Light of the sun. %0a> %0a> At the end of correction, a Zivug on Malchut herself (the primordial, but %0a> corrected egoism) will transpire, and all the particular Zivugim that were made %0a> on all the Lights through the 6,000 years (made not on Malchut, but on her %0a> inclusion in Yesod) will thereby disappear. %0a> %0a> The Temple will be restored from Heaven, for Bina herself does not wish to %0a> receive Ohr Hochma. And it will not occur because she cannot, but because she %0a> does not want to. This degree is referred to as "in the hands of Heaven." For %0a> example, it is written in the blessing on the new moon: "Life, which contains %0a> the fear of Heaven, and the fear of sinning." This life is above our reasoning and %0a> desires, for it is said that faith must be "above reason"; otherwise, sins will ensue. %0a> %0a> Thus, one desires nothing more than to go by faith above his reason and %0a> desires, for he is afraid to sin. However, there exists an even Higher Degree: when %0a> he no longer fears sinning, as he now has a screen, but still prefers to proceed by %0a> faith above reason and desires, for he yearns to be dissolved in the Upper One. %0a> %0a> The reason for the Light's disappearance from Guf de Atik prior to these %0a> corrections is that the two Malchu^ot (Bina and Malchut, called SAG and BON) %0a> no longer exist. After the great Zivug of Atik, BON were annulled along with %0a> the screen of SAG, as Guf de Atik contains the connection between Bina and %0a> Malchut, designed for their interaction during the 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> As a result of such interaction between Bina and Malchut, an opportunity %0a> arises to partially, gradually correct Malchut. In this mutual Zivug with Malchut, %0a> which is merged with Bina (Bina's properties), Atik first creates AA and then all %0a> the other Partzufim of the worlds of Atzilut and BYA. %0a> %0a> And since the screen of Malchut (Masach de BON) now disappears, the %0a> screen of Bina (Masach de SAG) disappears as well, as they are merged together. %0a> In the absence of Malchut and the screen, this Zivug stops, and all the Light of %0a> Guf de Atik emanating from this Zivug on the mutual screen of Malchut and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 247 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina disappears. Therefore, all the Light that descended from its Guf (called %0a> Temples) disappeared. %0a> %0a> In Rosh de Atik there is a Zivug on Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. Merged with %0a> Bina and existing for 6,000 years, the screen of Malchut disappears. As a result, %0a> the Light disappears as well. Malchut has yet to ascend to SAG to receive her %0a> perfection, as there is still no new Light. This complete absence of Light is called %0a> "destruction." However, Malchut then receives the Light of AVI, and the worlds %0a> of BYA merge with the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> 95. And the Holy Throne (Malchut) is overthrown. Hence, the prophet %0a> Yechezkel (Ezekiel) wrote, "I am in exile," signifying that the degree called %0a> "I," which is Malchut, is in exile. Why? "By the river Kevar." Kevar %0a> (already) is the river that had already existed, but has now disappeared. As it %0a> is written, "The river is destroyed and dried up." It was "destroyed" in the %0a> first Temple and "dried up" in the second. Hence, it is written: "He struck %0a> and destroyed both, Ariel and Moav." Moav (or Mi Aw) means "from the %0a> Heavenly Father." They were all destroyed for Him, and all the Light that %0a> shone upon Israel disappeared. %0a> %0a> The word Kursa, derived from the word Kisse (throne) or Kissuy (cover) %0a> signifies the combination of the properties of Malchut and Bina, which leads %0a> to the Light descending to BYA during the 6,000 years. The Holy Throne is %0a> overthrown, because the screen of Bina (Kisse) has been annulled, as it is said, "I %0a> am in exile," where "I" designates Malchut. %0a> %0a> The entire spiritual complex is structured like a ladder, where Malchut of %0a> the Upper Partzuf becomes (descends to) the Keter of the lower one. This is also %0a> indicated in the names: Malchut is called "I" (Ani = Aleph-Nun-Yod) and Keter is %0a> called "no" (Ein = Aleph-Yod-Nun), as it is completely unattainable. Only that %0a> which is perceived within Malchut can be attained; hence, it is called "I." %0a> %0a> Only Malckut of the Upper Partzuf acts as a link between the Partzufim: the %0a> Upper One makes a Zivug on its Malchut, creates Ohr Hozer, and receives (clothes) %0a> the Upper Light within it, and then Malchut of the Upper One descends to the %0a> lower Partzuf in the form of Ohr Hozer. This state of the Upper One clothing in %0a> the lower one is called the exile of the Upper One, for the Zivug with the Upper %0a> Light disappears from it, and the Upper Light disappears from all the Partzufim. %0a> And the river dries up— the corrected screen is called the "river," for it causes the %0a> Upper Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a> %0a> However, now that the screen (river) disappears, the descent of the Upper %0a> Light disappears as well. The destruction of the river in the First Temple causes %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 248 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the disappearance of Ohr Haya; the river in the Second Temple dries up, and %0a> Ohr Neshama vanishes along with it. The river in the First Temple is destroyed %0a> because the Zivug in AVI is stopped; the Light in YESHSUT is exhausted, and %0a> the river in the Second Temple dries up. %0a> %0a> The source of Ohr Haya and Neshama is Aba, called the "Heavenly Father," for %0a> he shines in ZA, called "Heaven," with the Light that elevates ZON to YESHSUT %0a> (the Second Temple) and to AVI (the First Temple). Because the Light stops %0a> shining from Guf de Atik, all of the Light descending to Israel disappears. This %0a> refers not only to the Light of the two Temples, but to all of the Light shining %0a> upon Israel, including Ohr VAK and the Light in the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> 96. Further, He descended and struck the lion. Initially, when this river %0a> rolled its waters down, Israel was in a state of perfection, for they offered %0a> up gifts and sacrifices to atone for their sins and to save their souls. Then, the %0a> image of a lion would descend from Above, and they would see it on the %0a> altar as it trampled the bodies of the sacrifices, devouring them, and all the %0a> dogs (all those who slander Israel) would fall to silence. %0a> %0a> The fire that consumes the sacrifices laid on the Temple altar resembled %0a> a lion, and towered over the sacrifices, like a lion (Talmud, Yoma, 21:2), and %0a> that fire burned the sacrifices laid down by the sons of Israel. However, this is a %0a> corporeal image that a regular person perceives in our world. %0a> %0a> But we shall follow our higher analysis and detach ourselves from this %0a> corporeal image; we will explain the action in the spiritual world that this %0a> language actually alludes to. All the languages in the Torah, including that which %0a> describes a rather corporeal image of sacrifice, speak only of spiritual actions. %0a> The most precise language for the description of these actions is the language of %0a> Kabbalah. However, this language is clear only to those who have ascended to %0a> the spiritual worlds and see both the roots, i.e., the events that transpire in the %0a> spiritual worlds, as well as their corporeal consequences. %0a> %0a> Before the Light of Atik disappeared, when the Upper Light still shone upon %0a> Israel, like a river rolling its waters, Israel was in a state of perfection: by means %0a> of sacrifice, it raised its MAN (request), thus evoking a Zivug on its screen, and %0a> MAD (the Light, abundance) descends on it. As a result of these actions, it grew %0a> closer to the Heavenly Father, and all the impure forces distanced from it, for it %0a> purified its souls, and purification signifies distancing from the impure forces %0a> (desires), the way a soiled garment is cleansed from dirt. %0a> %0a> Hence, the Hebrew word for sacrifice is Korban, derived from the word %0a> Karov (near). Thus, sacrifice signifies a person tearing away a part of his inner %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 249 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> animal egoism for the sake of drawing closer to the Creator. This is what brings %0a> Israel closer to their Heavenly Father. %0a> %0a> And since Israel existed in perfection and raised MAN for the Creator's %0a> pleasure alone, its MAN would ascend to Bina. The Light of Bina is called Ohr %0a> Hassadim, and its form resembles the image of a lion, like the property of bestowal, %0a> Hesed. This means that the lion-Bina receives Israel's good desires and deeds. And %0a> it was seen how Bina consumes Israel's MAN— Ohr Hassadim descends from Bina %0a> onto this MAN, like a lion trampling his prey (MAN) and devouring it. %0a> %0a> A lion devouring its prey is the principal aspect of sacrifice, for it signifies %0a> raising MAN to strengthen a screen and create Ohr Hozer. And since the %0a> magnitude of the received Ohr Yashar is determined by the magnitude (height) %0a> of Ohr Hozer, which creates the screen, it follows that existence and growth of %0a> Ohr Yashar is dependent on the Ohr Hozer. The greater the Ohr Hozer, the greater %0a> the descending Ohr Yashar becomes. %0a> %0a> In other words, to the extent that every one of us desires to "bestow," he %0a> evokes a corresponding response from Above, from the root of his soul. And just %0a> as in our world a living being's life and strength depend on nutrition (it simply dies %0a> without it), the Upper Light depends on the Light reflected by the screen. When it %0a> stops, the Upper Light disappears from the Partzuf, i.e., man stops feeling it. %0a> %0a> The Upper Light descends from Bina as Ohr Yashar (called a "lion"), i.e., in %0a> the form of "bestowal," in accordance with Bina 's nature. And man sees (feels!) %0a> how Ohr Yashar clothes in Ohr Hozer, which ascends from its sacrifice (rejection %0a> of egoism), the lion's nourishment. %0a> %0a> It devours its prey and thereby grows: the extent of Israel's perfection and %0a> their ability to offer sacrifices, to "bestow," determines the magnitude of their %0a> MAN and the force with which the Ohr Yashar strikes the screen, which reflects %0a> the Direct Light (pleasure) from below upwards with all its might. Moreover, it %0a> does so in great fear: for what if it fails to reflect the Light and desires to enjoy %0a> the Light of this commandment selfishly? %0a> %0a> That is precisely where one's work lies. It is called "faith above reason," for %0a> it must rise above one's reason (egoism) and intellect. Conversely, those who %0a> ceive inner confidence that it is enough to advance within one's nature ar %0a> cred still," a pure inanimate (non-developing) being, as such re %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, if the height of Ohr Hozer is great, it is defined as a lion that tears %0a> and devours its prey, as a victor, for it grows and ascends to a higher spiritual %0a> level thanks to the efforts of the lower one (man). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 250 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The impure force, the selfish will to receive pleasure is called "a dog," as it %0a> is written: "The leech has two daughters (who demand): Give-give." (Mishley, %0a> 30:15). They bark like a dog, and demand (to receive) both this world and the %0a> next. And the Higher One ascends, the stronger this impure force, called Klipa, %0a> becomes. And its strongest part corresponds to Ohr Yechida, opposite the lion %0a> devouring its prey). %0a> %0a> The lion represents mercy and bestowal, unwillingness to receive anything %0a> for oneself. As it is written in The Ethics of the Fathers, 95: "A Chassid, the merciful %0a> righteous one, says, 'What's yours is yours, and what's mine is yours,'" so is the %0a> impure force (dog) aimed wholly at reception, and has no aspiration to bestow. %0a> As it is said in the Talmud (Bava Batra, 10:2), "The righteous among the nations %0a> of the world: all their mercy is for themselves alone;" hence, they are connected %0a> to the impure force of a dog. (Under no circumstances should any of this be %0a> interpreted literally, for, as it was repeatedly explained, the whole of the Kabbalah %0a> speaks only of man's-prototype. Israel is one's inner aspiration to the Creator, %0a> and Goy (a gentile) signifies egoism (regardless of and unrelated to one's origin). %0a> Relate this to the above-mentioned corporeal and spiritual Temples, where there %0a> is no connection between rocks and spiritual objects. It is also unclear to the %0a> uninitiated why altruism is the property of a lion, while a dog, a loyal animal, is %0a> the root of egoism and impurity). %0a> %0a> It is therefore said that when Israel was perfect, it acquired the property of a %0a> lion, and all the dogs left it be, for it gave Malchut the strength to raise Ohr Hozer %0a> to great heights (devoured its prey, like a victor), and the impure force, like a %0a> dog, was afraid to come near it, and would hide in fear of the lion. %0a> %0a> 97. Yet, when sins increased, he descended to the lower degrees and slew the %0a> lion. This was because the lion refused to give up its prey as before, and this %0a> is as though he killed it. Therefore, he struck the lion and threw it into a pit, %0a> to the Evil Side (according to his understanding). The Evil Side saw this and %0a> sent a dog to devour the sacrifices from the altar in the lion's stead. What is %0a> the name of that lion? And what is the nickname of that dog? Baladan is its %0a> name; Baladan is formed by the words Bal'Adam, where the letter Mem is %0a> replaced by Nun, for he is not a human being at all, but a dog, and his face is %0a> like a muzzle of a dog. %0a> %0a> ("He" refers to Benayahu Ben Yehoyada Ben Ish Chai, Rav Paalim u Mekabtziel, %0a> in whom the degree of Atik, all of the Light, shines all at once.) Due to the %0a> disappearance of the screens of Malchut (BON) and Bina (SAG), Israel below could %0a> no longer raise MAN (the will to "bestow," the screen, the lion's nourishment). %0a> The Zivug stopped, and the Upper Light (lion) disappeared in its Root Above. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 251 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> "Threw it into a pit"— the root of the desire to receive for one's own sake %0a> is in the eyes, as Rashi said: "The eye sees, and the heart burns with desire" %0a> (The weekly portion Shlach). This will to receive for oneself is called an "empty, %0a> waterless pit" (Beresheet, 37:24). The Upper Light does not fill it. Although it is %0a> empty, it is unworthy of being a vessel for the Light, as it is written: "He and I %0a> cannot dwell in the same abode" (Talmud, Suta, 5). %0a> %0a> Thus, the lion was thrown into a pit, for it was struck before the eyes of %0a> the impure egoistic force, called an "empty, waterless pit." And these pits now %0a> emerge from their hideouts and reveal their power, and in place of a lion appears %0a> a barking dog. %0a> %0a> ZA-MA = 45 is called Adam = Aleph + Dalet + Mem = 1 + 4 + 40 = 45, when %0a> he receives the Light from Bina. The property of Bina is bestowal. Hence, it is %0a> written: "Man is your name" (Talmud, Yevamot, 61), referring only to those who %0a> attain the property of bestowal, but not to the others, of whom it is said: "Even %0a> their mercy is only for their profit" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 10:2), and who are %0a> therefore called Baladan (Bal-Adan). %0a> %0a> 98. On a day of snow, on the day misfortunes descend from the Supernal %0a> Court Above, it is written, "Her household shall not fear snow," that is, the %0a> Supernal Court, called "snow." For her household is clothed twofold, and can %0a> thereby endure a strong fire. So the book says. %0a> %0a> Strictness, judgment (Din) or restriction imposed on the use of egoism in the %0a> male part is called "snow" that stems from the Supernal Court. These restrictions %0a> are very powerful, but are mitigated below the Chazeh, where Malchut receives %0a> them. Nulcva describes these restrictions in the following way: "Surround me %0a> with roses," (Shir HaShirim, 2) referring to two fires: the Upper— Bina, and the %0a> lower, her own— Malchut. %0a> %0a> After Malchut acquires these two fires, she weakens the strictness of the cold %0a> snow with her fire. Hence, it is written in Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) that %0a> her household shall not fear snow (the Supernal Court), i.e., the restrictions %0a> imposed on the male part, for her household is clothed twofold. In other words, %0a> on the contrary, the snow helps her withstand the heat of her fire. And only %0a> now that the screen and Zivug are gone, and the two fires are no more, the %0a> restrictions of the snow return. %0a> %0a> 99. What is written next? "And he struck an Egyptian." This refers to a secret: %0a> every time Israel sinned, the Creator would conceal Himself and restrict them %0a> from receiving all the goodness and all the Light that He shone upon them. %0a> "He struck an Egyptian." "He" refers to Moshe, the Light that shines upon %0a> Israel. For in Egypt he was born, grew up, and attained the Supernal Light. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 252 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah speaks not of man, but of the Light that disappeared and %0a> concealed itself. Hence, it is defined as "slain." Gone is the great Light, with %0a> which Moshe shone upon Israel. And this Light is called the "Egyptian," for %0a> in Egypt Moshe was born, grew up, and attained the great Supernal Light, the %0a> Light that delivered Israel from Egypt. %0a> %0a> 100. A man of mirror. It is written, mirror and man, as it is written, a Godly %0a> man, the husband of that mirror, of the Creator's glory, Malchut. For with %0a> this degree he merited ruling over the entire land in all of his desire— a feat %0a> unmatched by any other. %0a> %0a> The difference between Moshe and the other prophets is that Moshe is the %0a> foundation of ZA, as he constructs and passes the Light from ZA to Malchut, %0a> whereas the other prophets are the foundation of Malchut, and receive from %0a> her. Hence, it is written of him: "Godly man," the husband of Malchut, called %0a> the "Creator's greatness." And why is Moshe called the husband of Malchut 7 . %0a> Because he attained the level of ZA and gives the Light to Malchut. Therefore, it %0a> is written that his attainments are beyond anyone else's, for the other prophets %0a> receive from Malchut, and are therefore ruled by her. %0a> %0a> He who attains Malchut receives from her. The degree called Moshe means %0a> that he who attains it gives the Light to Malchut, instead of receiving from her. %0a> Yet, how can this be? How can one possibly rise above Malchut if all our souls %0a> originate from her and exist in the worlds of BYA? This indicates the state of %0a> ascent above Malchut, which is how Moshe ascends to Bina. %0a> %0a> 101. This is the Creator's staff that was delivered to him, as it is written, %0a> "With the Creator's staff in my hand." This is the staff that was created on %0a> the evening of the sixth day of the creation, before Shabbat. And His Holy %0a> Name is contained in it. And with this staff Moshe sinned by striking it %0a> twice against the rock. The Creator said to him: "Moshe, it is not for this %0a> purpose that I have not given you My staff; thus, it will no longer be in your %0a> possession henceforth." %0a> %0a> The words "evening" and "twilight" signify the state of mitigation of Malchut 's %0a> strictness by the properties of Bina to an extent that it becomes impossible to %0a> distinguish Malchut from Bina. This is because on Shahhat, Malchut ascends to %0a> AVI and becomes Bina. However, on the twilight of Shabbat, Malchut is not %0a> yet Bina, but is no longer Malchut (everything in the book speaks only of the %0a> properties of spiritual objects, for nothing but desires exists in the spiritual %0a> worlds. Only in our world are desires clothed in physical bodies). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 253 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, it is said that ten things were created in the twilight, when there is no %0a> distinction between the thing itself and its origin, Bina or Malchut, for Malchut %0a> herself shows no distinction. And such is the property of the staff that was created %0a> in the twilight, before the world's first Shabbat. Hence, it possesses the holy (special) %0a> property of the Creator's name, an allusion to the properties of Bina, from which %0a> holiness (altruism) descends. And Malchut is ready to receive this holiness. %0a> %0a> And these two properties of Bina and Malchut are contained in the Creator's %0a> staff, utterly indistinguishable from one another, for they were created in the %0a> twilight. Hence, with the help of this staff, i.e., by means of the property of %0a> uniting Malchut with Bina, all the fortunes and wonders, all of the Light can be %0a> brought to Israel, for this is the purpose behind the Light's descent from Bina %0a> to Malchut. With the help of this property (the staff), Moshe merited an ascent %0a> to Bina, up to the degree of "Godly man." Therefore, the staff is called the %0a> Creator's staff, according to the name of Bina. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called Tzur (rock), and upon ascending to Bina, she is called Sela %0a> (another name for a rock). The inner Zivug between ZON (ZA and Malchut) in %0a> the state of their ascent to AVI, when Nukva uses Ima's Kelim, is called "speech." %0a> The outer Zivug between ZON, when they are in their own place, is called "Zivug %0a> de Hakaa" (a Zivug by Striking). %0a> %0a> It is hence written to Moshe in the weekly Torah portion Bashalach: "You %0a> shall strike the rock (Tzur), and it shall bring forth water" (Shemot, 17:6), for %0a> a Zivug de Hakaa occurs within Malchut herself. However, it is written in the %0a> weekly portion Chulcat: "Speak ye unto the rock before all eyes, that it give forth %0a> its water" (Bamidbar, 20:8), for the "rock" is in Bina, and the Zivug within her is %0a> called "speech." %0a> %0a> And herein lies the sin of Moshe: he struck twice: in addition to first %0a> striking the Tzur, he struck the Sela, which lacks the strike, and only has a %0a> Zivug in the form of speech. Since there is no distinction in the Creator's staff, %0a> and it is unclear whether it refers to Malchut or to Bina, he also applied it to %0a> Sela-Bina. And the Creator told him that the staff was given to him to use with %0a> Tzur, but not with Sela. %0a> %0a> 102. At once He descended to him in strictness and wrenched the staff from %0a> the Egyptian's hand, for the moment the staff was taken from him, it was %0a> taken for good. And he was killed by it: because of the sin of striking the rock %0a> with the staff, he died and did not enter the Holy Land. And that Light was %0a> concealed from Israel. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 254 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It was already mentioned in item 94 that as a result of a great Zivug in %0a> Atik, only BON were supposed to disappear, but not SAG, for BON could have %0a> immediately risen and forever become like SAG. However, as SAG and BON %0a> were merged, SAG disappeared together with BON. %0a> %0a> The Light of Moshe disappeared from Israel for the same reason— because %0a> he committed an even greater sin and harmed the union of BON and SAG by %0a> striking the Sela. Hence, harsh judgment descended upon him, which refers to %0a> the disappearance of the Light of SAG. Indeed, SAG is no longer connected to %0a> BON in any way, and the annulment of BON has no influence on it. %0a> %0a> This is the meaning of what is written in Psalms: "He resembled those who %0a> draw axes at a copse of trees, but now all of his adornments are smashed by %0a> hatchets and axes" (Tehilim, 74:5). Due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, and her %0a> correction there, Malchut is like a "copse of trees," for SAG, too, is annulled by %0a> the merging with BON, Malchut's ascent, as if struck with "hatchets and axes." %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written that the staff was taken from the Egyptian, and will %0a> never return to him, for the staff refers to Malchut. So the Light disappears for %0a> good, because BON renews itself afterwards and becomes SAG forever. Thus, it %0a> is no longer necessary to use the staff for striking. %0a> %0a> It is written in this regard that he was slain by the same staff, for had he %0a> been careful and used it only once— striking the Tzur, but not the Sela— SAG %0a> would not have been annulled together with BON, and he would not have died. %0a> Instead, he would have immediately risen to SAG. %0a> %0a> This is why it is written that Moshe shall not enter the Holy Land, Israel, as %0a> Israel is BON in the state of ascent to SAG, and it is called the Holy Land, for %0a> the Light of Bina (called the Holy Light) shines in it. However, until the end of %0a> correction arrives, there are still ascents and descents, which cause destructions %0a> (disappearance of the Light) and revelations (shining of the Light). But at the %0a> end of correction, BON will remain within SAG permanently as Eretz Israel, and %0a> there shall be no more exiles from it. %0a> %0a> 103. "The most respected of the thirty" refers to the Upper One that receives %0a> from Above and passes downward, one that receives and brings closer. %0a> However, he does not go to the first three, but they come to him and give to %0a> him wholeheartedly, but he does not come to them. %0a> %0a> GAR (HBD) are called "thirty," as each of the three Sefirot HBD consists of %0a> ten, which amounts to thirty. And their Light shines in all of the 6,000 years. %0a> The soul of Benayahu appears out of the great Zivug of Atik, which accumulates %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 255 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> all the Zivugim during the 6,000 years. Hence, it is called Rav Paalim (performing %0a> many actions) and Mekabtziel (gathering all into one degree-Part^u/, called %0a> Benayahu Ben Yehoyada). %0a> %0a> Therefore, he receives the Light of all of the Supernal Thirty, which descends %0a> to his soul. Indeed, he consists of particular Zivugim that have transpired through %0a> the 6,000 years, which he gathers into one. And, although they give him the %0a> best of their properties wholeheartedly, he still cannot draw closer to them and %0a> subsequently receive from them. This is because the disappearance of the screen %0a> in ZON made the screen in SAG disappear as well. Hence, he cannot come to %0a> them, raise MAN, and receive from them further. %0a> %0a> 104. Despite not being considered one of them, David heard the meaning %0a> that is never detached from the heart, for they can never be separated. David %0a> paid attention with all his heart, but he did not pay attention to David. For by %0a> the praises, hymns, and mercy that the moon offers the sun, the moon draws %0a> the sun closer so as to be with it. %0a> %0a> David is Malchut; Malchut comes from the word Melech (King). Therefore, %0a> David is King, for his properties are the properties of Malchut (kingdom). %0a> And this is the fourth leg (support) of GAR. Hence, it is written that although %0a> he cannot be together with the thirty (GAR), he nonetheless clings to these %0a> properties, and never detaches himself from them. %0a> %0a> This is because Malchut's entire perfection is revealed in him, for it stems %0a> from the great Zivug of Atik, which destroys all the impure forces of BON, as it is %0a> said: "He destroys evil forever." %0a> %0a> Therefore, David resolved to never part with it again, for it is his perfection. %0a> However, Benayahu Ben Yehoyada paid no attention to David, as David is the %0a> fourth support of GAR. Hence, it is as though he is unable to receive from GAR. %0a> And since he cannot receive from David, he pays no attention to him. %0a> %0a> With the help of the MAN of Malchut (called Se'ara— stormy wind), which %0a> is raised to ZA (called "Heaven"), as a result of the hymns, praises, and mercy, %0a> Malchut receives the Light of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada's soul, which is absolute %0a> perfection, and merges with it for all eternity. %0a> %0a> 105. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell down on their faces before him and could %0a> not see him anymore, then rose and went in every direction, but could not %0a> see him. They sat and wept, and could not even speak to one another. Then, %0a> Rabbi Aba said, "It is true what we have learned, that the Torah accompanies %0a> the righteous on all their paths. The righteous of the other world come to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 256 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> them to reveal to them the secrets of the Torah. And this must have been %0a> Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, who came to us from the other world to reveal these %0a> secrets to us. But before we could recognize him, he vanished." They rose and %0a> wanted to lead their donkeys on, but could not. They repeatedly tried to goad %0a> the donkeys, but still they could not move. They grew frightened and left their %0a> donkeys behind. And to this day this place is called "the place of donkeys." %0a> %0a> Because they could not bear such a powerful Light, which was revealed to %0a> them upon the disclosure of those secrets, they fell (Katnut) and then rose (Gadlut), %0a> for it was so unbearable. After they merited receiving from it such a great degree, %0a> this Light disappeared at once and did not reappear, and they could not attain it %0a> anymore. Hence, they wept (a kind of Katnut) out of great grief that they had lost %0a> such exalted attainment, and they could not speak (absence of Kelim). %0a> %0a> The bitterness of their loss made them realize that it was the degree of %0a> Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself, and not lower, as they had mistakenly thought %0a> before. The forces that they received from the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba are %0a> called "donkeys," with which they can raise MAN, the request to attain Higher %0a> Degrees, Haya and Yechida. %0a> %0a> In other words, the soul is a spiritual force of Light; like a pulling force of %0a> a donkey that helps overcome egoistic desires and move from place to place in %0a> the spiritual world, onto a Higher Degree. To raise MAN means to feel what is %0a> lacking and what needs to be attained— this is what man's work is all about. %0a> %0a> Such is the work of a righteous soul— it helps man by lifting him up onto %0a> his donkey (egoism) and taking the lead (pulling) in order to illuminate (give %0a> strength) for him the path of the righteous. And now, when its role has been %0a> completed, this soul disappears, although they would have very much liked to %0a> continue ascending and riding its donkeys, i.e., they wished to raise MAN anew %0a> to return and attain once more. %0a> %0a> However, they could no longer receive the strength to raise MAN. Thus, %0a> they were struck by fear and left their donkeys in that place, which is hence %0a> called "the place of donkeys," for they could not use them any longer. %0a> %0a> 106. Rabbi Elazar opened and said: "Oh, how great is Your goodness, which %0a> You have hidden away for those who fear You! (Tehilim, 31:20). How infinite %0a> is the goodness that the Creator shall bestow on humankind in the future, %0a> on those sin-fearing, exalted righteous, who study the Torah as they arrive %0a> at that Upper World." %0a> %0a> The words "great goodness" refer to Gadlut, the attainment of the Light of %0a> GAR. For the basis of a Partzuf is its VAK— the amount of Light necessary for its %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 257 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> existence, received from the Zivug of AVI, who make this Zivug and emit Ohr %0a> Hassadim, necessary to sustain the worlds. And all the extra Light, necessary %0a> for existence, is called GAR or Ohr Hochma— the additional, delectable and %0a> great Light. %0a> %0a> This Ohr Hochma, the Light of GAR, stems from Bina, which is called "the %0a> world to come." It is clothed in Ohr Hassadim that emerges from a Zivug of the %0a> Sefira Yesod (Chai Olamim— life of the worlds), and from there descends to the %0a> righteous who fear to sin. %0a> %0a> The Zivug of AVI, when they are at the degree of Bina, gives Ohr Hassadim %0a> to ZA for the sustenance of the worlds. However, when AVI ascend to AA and %0a> beget new souls by their Zivug, their Zivug is inconstant, as it emits Ohr Hochma, %0a> called "new souls." %0a> %0a> 107. The name "great goodness" can be further described as containing all %0a> the secrets of the Supernal wisdom, which descend from ZA to Malchut. %0a> There is a great tree, called ZA or Rav (great, strong), and there is a small tree, %0a> Malchut, which grows from it. And it is elevated to the Highest Firmament. %0a> %0a> In addition to the attainment of the Light of GAR, there is also the inner %0a> part of the Supernal wisdom with its secrets, which become revealed in the %0a> Zivug of Atik at the completion of the 6,000 years, the end of correction. MA %0a> designates the lower world, Malchut. The great and strong tree is ZA in the state %0a> of ascent to Partzuf AB, as in this state he receives Ohr Hochma, and Hochma %0a> signifies strength (not "reason— strength" but the strength of Ohr Hochma lies in %0a> the fact that it allows one to go against reason, in defiance of common sense, in %0a> faith above reason). %0a> %0a> However, when ZA is in his place, he is simply called "a tree," for he lacks %0a> Ohr Hochma and has only VAK, Ohr Hassadim. Malchut is also called a tree and %0a> grows together with ZA; ZA ascends to Aba, to the utmost height, to the Supernal %0a> Firmament— Atik. %0a> %0a> 108. The "great goodness" is the Light that was created on the first day of %0a> creation and concealed so as to be revealed in the future for the righteous %0a> in the other world. Your Deeds are the Supernal Garden of Eden, which the %0a> Creator has created by His act. %0a> %0a> The Light that was created on the first day of creation is the Light in which %0a> Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. Hence, the word "Light" is %0a> used five times in the Torah's description of the first day of creation. This Light is %0a> intended for the righteous in the world to come, for it is concealed in Yesod de Aha %0a> and in Yesod de Ima, which are collectively called "righteousness and justice." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 258 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (In Hebrew, the words Tzedek— justice and Tzadik— righteous/just have the %0a> same root. This name is given to one who attains the Creator's governance and %0a> sees that His governance is just; hence, he justifies all of the Creator's actions, %0a> and is thus called righteous. The other meaning of the word 'righteous' refers to %0a> man's belief that the Creator is righteous, because in spirituality, one assumes the %0a> name of the degree one has attained. If he attains that the Creator is righteous %0a> by receiving this knowledge from the degree onto which he ascends, then he is %0a> already called by the name of that degree.) %0a> %0a> Ohr Hochma can be received only in "precious garments," called %0a> righteousness and justice, that is, only with these intentions. The above excerpt %0a> speaks of an open action, implying unrestricted diffusion of Light, as it will %0a> be after the end of all the corrections. In the Torah, such a state is called "the %0a> Supernal Garden of Eden." %0a> %0a> In the meantime, only the complete and perfect righteous ones, the souls %0a> of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada and others that merited reception of Light from the %0a> great Zivug of Atik, gather all the Light of the 6,000 years. These souls' place of %0a> rest is referred to as the Garden of Eden. %0a> %0a> There exists the lower Garden of Eden of earth, which is VAK, and the %0a> Supernal one, GAR. All the souls dwell in the lower Garden of Eden, and only %0a> on new moons and Sabbaths do they ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden, %0a> and then return to their place. However, there are individual, special persons %0a> (souls), whose place is in the Supernal Garden of Eden. These are the souls of %0a> which Rabbi Shimon says: "I saw them ascending, but their numbers were few." %0a> %0a> 109. All the righteous stand in the lower Garden of Eden, clothed in precious %0a> adornments, similar in quality and form to those which they wore in this %0a> world, meaning in the same form as people in this world and according to %0a> man's actions in this world. They stand there and fly away through the air, %0a> ascend to the Assembly in the Supernal Garden of Eden, fly there and bathe %0a> in the dew of the pure river of Apharsemon (persimmon), then come down %0a> and fly below in the lower Garden of Eden. %0a> %0a> The main difference between GAR and ZAT with regard to both Partzufim %0a> and souls is that GAR (KHB) do not need the garment of Hassadim. They can %0a> receive Ohr Hochma as it is. However, Partzufim of VAK and the souls born %0a> from ZON, whose basis is VAK (Ohr Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim), can only %0a> receive Ohr Hochma when it is clothes in Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> The Ruach de Tzadikim (spirit of the righteous) in the lower Garden of Eden %0a> is clothed in Ohr Hassadim, just as human souls in this world. And with the help %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 259 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of these precious garments, they can ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a> and there receive Ohr Hochma. Afterwards, they return to their place in the %0a> lower Garden of Eden, for that is their permanent place. %0a> %0a> They ascend by the power of Ohr Hassadim, called "air," and fly to the %0a> Supernal Garden of Eden to receive Ohr Hochma, called the river of Apharsemon. %0a> However, they cannot stay there, so they immediately descend from the Supernal %0a> Garden of Eden to the lower. The Zohar compares them to human souls, for %0a> both the Upper and the lower human souls need to receive the garment of Ohr %0a> Hassadim in order to correct themselves and ascend. %0a> %0a> 110. And sometimes these righteous appear as people in order to perform %0a> miracles, like celestial angels, just as we have seen the luminescence of the %0a> Upper Light, but did not merit to see and discover the wisdom's great secrets. %0a> %0a> DID NOT MERIT TO DISCOVER THE WISDOM'S GREAT SECRETS- %0a> for the donkey driver had left them and disappeared. There are special souls %0a> that abide in the Supernal Garden of Eden. They have risen so high that the %0a> souls from the lower Garden of Eden ascend to them only on new moons %0a> and Sabbaths, and, being unable to stay there, immediately descend to their %0a> permanent place. However, they are nonetheless similar to human souls, which %0a> descend from the Supernal Garden of Eden to this world and meet people, just %0a> like the angels that seldom descend to this world. %0a> %0a> Now they have seen the Light of the Supernal Luminary, the Light of Rabbi %0a> Hamnuna-Saba that descended on them from the highest point, the Supernal %0a> Garden of Eden, and was revealed before them in this world (while they are still %0a> living in this world). %0a> %0a> AS PEOPLE refers to the souls that abide in the lower Garden of Eden, %0a> which have the form of people, and the Light of the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a> influences them. They can receive this Light during their ascent on new moons %0a> and Sabbaths, whereupon they merit meeting the souls of the Supernal Garden %0a> of Eden, and then descend to their permanent place. %0a> %0a> However, one may also say that the words AS PEOPLE refer to the people %0a> of our corporeal world, while the souls from the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a> sometimes descend to this world and, like exalted angels, appear before the eyes %0a> of the righteous. %0a> %0a> 111. Rabbi Aba opened and said: "And he who is doomed said to his wife, %0a> 'We shall die, for I have seen the Creator.' Even though he was not aware of %0a> his actions, as it is written, 'He did not know that it was an angel'; however, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 260 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> since it is written, 'Man shall not see Me and live,' we know that he has %0a> died. And we have merited this great Light to accompany us, and the world %0a> exists because the Creator Himself sent him to us, to reveal the secrets of His %0a> Supernal wisdom to us. How joyous is our share!" %0a> %0a> When the angel saw him who was doomed, he did not yet have the proper %0a> level of attainment; thus, the angel was unwilling to reveal his name. Yet, %0a> although he did not know and did not attain him, he still feared the words, %0a> "Man shall not see Me and live" (Shemot, 33:20). %0a> %0a> But we have merited complete attainment, for we came to know his name, %0a> Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And we live and exist in this world. It is therefore clear %0a> that the degree of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba is called "Show me Your glory" (Shemot, %0a> 33:18), Moshe's request of the Creator. %0a> %0a> But the Creator replied: "You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me %0a> and live." From this we see that they have attained more than Moshe. This state %0a> is described by sages as, "There was no prophet more exalted than Moshe, but %0a> there was a sage" (Yalkut Shimoni, the end). It is also written: "A sage is preferred %0a> to a prophet" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 12:1). Thus, they have spiritually ascended to %0a> merit the appearance of such an exalted soul, while still being in this world. %0a> %0a> 112. They walked and came to a mountain. The sun had set. The branches %0a> of the tree on that mountain started rattling and singing. As they were still %0a> walking, they heard a resounding voice proclaim, "Sons of the Holy Creator, %0a> dispersed among the living in this world, illuminated by the sons of the %0a> Assembly, gather in your places and rejoice with your Creator in the Torah." %0a> They grew frightened and stopped, then sat down. %0a> %0a> "They came to a mountain" refers to the words of King David, who said %0a> (Tehilim, 24:3): "Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord, and who shall %0a> stand in His holy place?" meaning who is worthy of it? After they climbed %0a> the mountain, the sun had set (the Light left the Partzuf). But they heard %0a> something from the trees, as it is written: "Then shall all the trees of the wood %0a> sing for joy" (Tehilim, 96:12). %0a> %0a> They heard a voice that told them to return to their place, rejoice in the %0a> Creator and His Torah, and descend from the mountain. And it calls them by %0a> the name of that High Degree, which they've achieved. But it hints that people %0a> are not worthy of being at that degree and in this world simultaneously. Yet, %0a> although they were frightened, they remained on the mountain, sat down, and %0a> did not move. "Grew frightened," "stopped," and "sat down" are the spiritual %0a> states of the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 261 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> We see how The Zohar explains the path of the righteous, those who cross %0a> the Machsom (the barrier that separates our world from the spiritual) and start %0a> ascending the rungs of the spiritual ladder. This path is diverse, and each book %0a> of the Torah describes it in its own way: the language of Kabbalah, legends, %0a> judicial laws, historical accounts of the Pentateuch, etc.. The Zohar draws a vivid %0a> picture for us— like a guidebook for those who will find themselves in the place %0a> of these exalted travelers in the spiritual world. Once there, you will see for %0a> yourselves what is implied by such notions as "mountain," "tree," and "voice." %0a> Then The Zohar will become your true guidebook! %0a> %0a> It is impossible to provide a more detailed description of the Partzufim, i.e., %0a> an inner perception of one who ascends spiritually. This is because the reader %0a> must first have certain analogous sensations of his own. If one could see only %0a> once what the described content (or something similar) really means, one would %0a> be able to clearly imagine what it speaks of. %0a> %0a> It is the same in our world: even if we have never been to a certain country, %0a> we can imagine what others describe to us by analogy with what we already %0a> know. But in this case, there is no analogy. One who sees the spiritual world %0a> for the first time realizes how wrong all of his previous visualizations have been! %0a> Hence, we can say nothing about many of the states described in The Zohar. %0a> %0a> 113. Meanwhile, a voice called out again, "O, mighty rocks, great hammers of %0a> thunder, Bina stands upon a pillar, so enter and assemble." At that moment, %0a> they heard the mighty voice of thousands of trees, which was saying, "The %0a> Creator's voice breaks the cedars." Both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell %0a> down on their faces. Great fear fell upon them. They rose hastily and left, not %0a> hearing anything else, then came down the mountain and kept on walking. %0a> %0a> It was previously said that they could not load their donkeys, meaning that %0a> they were unable to raise MAN, because Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba had already %0a> completed his helping mission. This is why they lost the power of their donkeys, %0a> and could not continue using them to raise MAN and merit Higher Degrees. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Rabbi Elazar said earlier that they did not merit seeing and %0a> attaining the secrets of the Supernal wisdom. The fact is that after they attained %0a> the level of Yechida, i.e., revealed the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada with the %0a> help of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the disappearance of the screen (Masach) of BON %0a> caused the loss of Masach de SAG. Hence, they could no longer raise MAN. %0a> %0a> The Light stopped descending to them from Guf de Atik specifically to %0a> give them the opportunity, or rather the strength to recreate Masach de SAG. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 262 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Consequently, BON will become like SAG, they will resume raising MAN, and %0a> will once more be able to ascend from degree to degree. %0a> %0a> Hence, as soon as both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba left their donkeys, %0a> they lost strength to raise MAN in order to bring BON back to the level of SAG. %0a> However, the voice proclaimed that they are as strong as rock and thunder, for %0a> so far they have endured all the trials. And they will gather strength to endure %0a> the mighty rocks and to overcome all the obstacles as before, until they obliterate %0a> these obstacles, like great hammers of thunder crashing down from Above. %0a> %0a> Bina, though herself colorless, is called "the source of colors." This is because %0a> she is all mercy, whereas all the other properties originate specifically from her %0a> by enduring all the trials, like rocks. From all this, Bina receives new forms, %0a> hence she received the powers of a new screen onto which emerge all the new %0a> degrees and Partzufim. %0a> %0a> Together with the voice that informed them of Bina 's new powers, they %0a> heard another voice, "The Creator's voice breaks the cedars" (Tehilim, 29:5), %0a> which let them know that all the cedars (obstacles) on their path to higher %0a> attainments have been removed. This gave them strength to climb down the %0a> mountain and continue their path onto Higher Degrees. %0a> %0a> 114. Upon reaching the house of Rabbi Yosi, the son of Rabbi Shimon %0a> Ben Yosi Ben Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon BarYochai. They rejoiced. %0a> Rabbi Shimon rejoiced, too. He said to them, "You have traveled this path %0a> of Heavenly signs and wonders correctly, for as I was sleeping, I saw you and %0a> Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, who was sending you two crowns with an old man, %0a> so as to adorn you. I am certain that the Creator was on this path too, because %0a> I see how your faces have changed." Rabbi Yosi said, "Truly, it is said that a %0a> sage is preferred to a prophet." Rabbi Elazar came and put his head on the %0a> knees of his father, Rabbi Shimon, and told him of what had happened. %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar gives an allegorical explanation of two states: first, they merited %0a> attaining the Light of SAG (called Rabbi Yosi) once more, and secondly, now %0a> SAG and AB join in a constant Zivug. We see this from their meeting with Rabbi %0a> Shimon, who signifies Ohr Hochma. In other words, they merited their BON %0a> returning and becoming like SAG in its constant and eternal Zivug with AB. %0a> %0a> Benayahu Ben Yehoyada sent them two crowns through Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a> Saba: Ohr Yechida, called Benayahu Ben Yehoyada himself, and a new Light AB- %0a> SAG, which they have just attained. This Light also came to them by the powers %0a> of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada as a reward for overcoming all the trials, thanks to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 263 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> which they, of all others, merited this degree, which is emanated from the great %0a> Light of his soul. %0a> %0a> Hence, it follows that he sent them two crowns. However, all these descents %0a> on their spiritual path were not failures; rather, the Creator Himself was %0a> leading them to that High Degree, which they have now attained. This is why %0a> it is written: I AM CERTAIN THAT THE CREATOR WAS ON THIS PATH %0a> (with you). However, HOW YOUR FACES HAVE CHANGED, for you have %0a> attained something else, described by the phrase, A SAGE IS PREFERRED %0a> TO A PROPHET. %0a> %0a> 115. Rabbi Shimon was frightened and wept. He said, "I have heard the %0a> Creator and I am awed." This verse was spoken by the prophet Havakuk %0a> (Habakkuk), when he saw his death and his resurrection by Elisha. Why was %0a> he named Havakuk? Because it is written that at around this time there would %0a> be a HOWEK-ET-a son will be embraced. For Havakuk was the son of the %0a> Shunamit. And there were two embraces: one from the mother and one from %0a> Elisha, as it is written, "He put his mouth to his." %0a> %0a> First, it is unclear how the prophet Elisha could pass a seed in his blessing %0a> to the Shunamit, for this seed cannot exist (procreate). Indeed, Elisha was the %0a> greatest prophet after Moshe and his soul came from the Supernal Garden of %0a> Eden. Hence, his BON (in Hebrew, the words Ben— son and BON are spelled the %0a> same way: Bet-Nun) was already absolutely pure and perfect. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when he passed his son to her, he tied him to the male side, %0a> whereas he tied Havakuk only to the female side. And since the female side, %0a> Nukva, is closer to the impure force, it clung itself to him, and he died. Thus, %0a> the reason for his death lies in the exalted level of the prophet, for his BON is %0a> pure and free from the clinging of impure forces. %0a> %0a> Hence, the prophet prayed: "The Creator has hidden it from me and had not %0a> told me!" (Melachim II, 4:27). In other words, he had not the slightest clue that he %0a> could die by being connected only to BON. That is why it was necessary to return, %0a> revive, and attach him to the Upper World, to the resurrection of the dead. %0a> %0a> The essence of the embryo is the white (Ohr Hochma) in it, as it is written %0a> (Talmud, Nidah, 31:1) that Aha (father) is Hochma, for Hochma is called %0a> "white," as it is said, "He made everything with Hochma (wisdom)" (Tehilim, %0a> 104). However, there is also a need for clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the intention %0a> "for the Creator's sake," as it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma, the Light %0a> of Wisdom, attainment and delight, without the clothing of Ohr Hassadim, %0a> without an altruistic intention. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 264 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> So the mother must provide the red, the screen, which provides Ohr %0a> Hassadim, required for the clothing of Ohr Hochma in it. As a result of the Ohr %0a> Hassadim embracing (clothing, enveloping) Ohr Hochma in itself, an embryo can %0a> exist. And here the embryo's entire embrace came only from the mother, the %0a> Shunamit, i.e., only from the female side (BON). %0a> %0a> Hence, when Elisha revived him, he gave him the white (Hochma) and the %0a> red (Hassadim) once more. It follows that it was Elisha himself who embraced %0a> him the second time. It is hence said that there were two Havakuks (from the %0a> word Hihuk— embrace): one from the mother and the other from Elisha. %0a> %0a> 116. 1 have discovered in the book of King Solomon that the name Havakuk %0a> consists of seventy-two names. Elisha created it with words. Each word consists %0a> of three letters, for the letters of the alphabet that the Father confirmed to him %0a> initially flew away when he died. But Elisha embraced him and confirmed in %0a> him all these letters in his seventy-two names. In all, there are 216 letters in his %0a> seventy-two names, three letters in each. %0a> %0a> The embryo is built of 216 = RYU (Reish = 200 + Yod =10 + Vav = 6) letters, %0a> designating Ohr Hochma, which descends to YESHSUT. This means that the %0a> embryo has RYU letters, which amounts to the Gematria of RE'IYAH = Reish- %0a> Aleph-Yod'Hey, i.e., the Light of vision. Re'iyah means vision in Hebrew, and %0a> vision is possible only in Ohr Hochma, for "seeing" means "attaining," and the %0a> Light of the eyes is the Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> When a growing Partzuf attains Gadlut, receives the clothing of Ohr Hassadim %0a> of the Upper World from AVI, and RYU clothe in Ohr Hassadim, this Partzuf is %0a> called AB (72) names, as each three letters join into one and RYU = 216 letters %0a> turn into AB = seventy-two groups with three letters in each group, or AB = %0a> seventy-two names. %0a> %0a> When Ohr Hassadim, the clothing of the Partzuf, comes only from the lower %0a> world, it is defined as RYU = 216 letters. And when it attains AB, Hassadim %0a> of the Upper World, each three letters form a group, and this results in AB = %0a> seventy-two names, as it is written, HE CONFIRMED IN HIM ALL THESE %0a> LETTERS. When Elisha revived Havakuk, the son of the Shunamit, he created %0a> the name Havakuk, AB = seventy-two letters from RYU = 216, for he gave him %0a> Ohr Hassadim of the Upper World from AB. %0a> %0a> Because of it, all 216 letters made groups of three and formed three lines %0a> from Above downwards: right, left and middle. A cell made of three letters— the %0a> right, left, and middle lines, situated horizontally (referring to the same screen %0a> and type of Kli)— is regarded as one. Therefore, AB (seventy-two) letters is used %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 265 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> instead of AB (seventy-two) names, because each letter is considered to include %0a> three, merged into one. When Ohr Hochma enters these seventy-two cells, the %0a> Partzuf is called AB and is said to have the complete Light of Hochma. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> One cell. In all, there are 72 %0a> such 3-letter cells (names) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Ohr Hassadim is the Light that brings peace in the state of the Partzuf at a %0a> given moment, for its property is not to wish anything for itself, but to bestow. %0a> However, Ohr Hassadim received from the lower world is merely comfort "for %0a> want of something better," whereas Ohr Hassadim received from the Upper World %0a> creates such a powerful property of "bestowal" that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma, %0a> thereby showing that although it has Ohr Hochma, it still prefers Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> This is similar to a person in our world, who says that he needs nothing. Yet, %0a> there is a distinction: does he say this in a state when he has nothing and can %0a> have everything he wants, but still wishes to restrict himself to bare essentials %0a> and to give away the rest? %0a> %0a> Therefore, when the growing Partzuf (the son— BON) had only Ohr Hassadim %0a> from the lower world, it could not receive Ohr Hochma in it, and was thus called %0a> RYU letters. But since the impure forces still cling to them and tempt the Partzuf %0a> to receive Ohr Hochma for itself, Ohr Hochma cannot be clothed within them. %0a> %0a> These RYU letters that Havakuk had since the day of his birth FLEW AWAY %0a> WHEN HE DIED. Hence, it was essential to give him RYU letters and AB %0a> names once more. And Elisha did just that by HIS SPIRIT, for he was obliged %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 266 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to recreate in him RYU letters in order to combine them into AB cells with %0a> the help of the Upper Hassadim (combine everything into three lines), when %0a> everything unites into AB names. %0a> %0a> 117. Elisha confirmed all of these letters in the soul of Havakuk so as to revive %0a> him by the letters of the seventy-two names. And he called him Havakuk, for that %0a> is his complete name, which describes all of his properties, as it alludes to two %0a> Havakuks and to the 216 letters of the Holy Name, as the Qematria (numerical %0a> value) of the name Havakuk is 216, from which the seventy-two names were %0a> formed. By AB names he revived him and brought his spirit back, and by RYU %0a> letters he revived his body and let it live. This is why he is called Havakuk. %0a> %0a> Havakuk = Chet + Bet + Kuf + Vav + Kuf = 8 + 2 + 100 + 6 + 100 = 216. %0a> The word Havakuk indicates two embraces (Hibukim, plural for Hibuk). Like %0a> all Hebrew names, it refers to the property of its bearer. For instance, Yaakov %0a> is derived from "Akev" ("got around" Esav), and Avraham signifies Av —father, %0a> Am— of the nation). %0a> %0a> The first embrace came from Ima, but it did not yet allow Ohr Hochma into %0a> the Partzuf, into RYU letters, for the impure force clings to the red in Ima. But %0a> then Elisha embraced him with Hassadim of the Upper World that came from %0a> AVI. This united the letters into groups (names), and Ohr Hochma entered and %0a> filled these names permanently, since the impure force cannot cling to Hassadim %0a> of the Upper World. %0a> %0a> As in the above example, even if all the Ohr Hochma were to be offered, the %0a> Partzuf, upon receiving protection in the form of a desire for Hassadim of the %0a> Upper World, receives such great strength (desire) to bestow that it never wants %0a> Hochma. This is precisely why Hochma can fill it for all eternity. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the name Havakuk denotes two Chihukim (embraces): one from %0a> the mother and one from Elisha, thereby imparting him with perfection from all %0a> sides: from both the Ohr Hochma and the Ohr Hassadim. "Embraces" signify Ohr %0a> Hassadim that stems from AVI, and Ohr Hochma received within Ohr Hassadim %0a> is called "the secrets of RYU." %0a> %0a> It is hence written that HE REVIVED HIS SPIRIT BY AB NAMES AND %0a> HIS BODY BY RYU LETTERS. And he was revived by Elisha's embrace, for %0a> RYU letters had formed names, that is, the three lines, in which Ohr Hochma %0a> could be received, thanks to the reception of Ohr Hassadim from AVI (the %0a> Upper World). %0a> %0a> The impure forces (man's egoistic desires) cannot attack in this Light. %0a> Hence, death (the result of receiving Ohr Hochma for oneself) does not exist. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 267 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Subsequently, he receives Ohr Hochma, which yields the complete correction %0a> of his Guf. %0a> %0a> However, the Partzuf '(son of the Shunamit) had RYU letters from the moment %0a> of birth, and they left him when he died. Then why is he called Havakuk (two %0a> embraces)? After all, the first embrace of Ima (mother) left him the moment %0a> of his death, and Elisha revived him from death by embracing him only once. %0a> Thus, does he not contain only the embrace of Elisha? %0a> %0a> The thing is that Elisha has given him nothing new at the time of resurrection, %0a> except for the embrace, the Light from the Supernal Ima— SAG, whose Light %0a> evokes the resurrection of the dead. And RYU letters were simply revived by his %0a> lower mother— BON. These are the same RYU of BON with which he was born. %0a> Otherwise, it would have been an entirely new soul, of which one would not %0a> have been able to say that it was dead and then resurrected. %0a> %0a> Therefore, now he truly has two embraces, for the first one has now been %0a> revived as well, when BON ascended to SAG. And since BON is in the place of %0a> SAG, his Hassadim are regarded as those of the Supernal Mother. They completely %0a> neutralize the impure forces and death, for their properties (desires) are only of %0a> bestowal, which the impure force cannot bear. Thus, they can no longer tempt %0a> man. This is why he is called Havakuk, after the action of the two embraces. %0a> %0a> 118. He said, "I have heard the Creator and I am awed by His Name." I %0a> have heard of what I had and have had a taste of the other world at the %0a> moment of death, before Elisha resurrected him, and I am awed. He began %0a> asking for mercy for his soul. He said, "O, Creator, the deeds that You %0a> have performed for me throughout the years were my life." And whoever %0a> connects to the past years (the name of the Sefirot of Atik), connects to life. %0a> Throughout the years, bestow life upon the degree that has no life of its %0a> own, upon Malchut de Malchut. %0a> %0a> His fear comes from the past, previous states, for now he has become perfect %0a> on all his sides, and therefore fear has no place. This fear remained from the past, %0a> when he left the world. This describes the state between death and resurrection. %0a> However, he continues receiving fear from the past state, so it would help him %0a> create a screen for raising MAN. It is precisely this fear from past times (states) %0a> that stimulates him to raise MAN (request for mercy). %0a> %0a> This is the secret of the future screen, after BON becomes SAG. For then %0a> "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8), and there will be no force %0a> evoking fear of death and suffering or able to cause harm to one's purity and %0a> holiness. Hence, there will be no need to shun, no one to beware of or avoid. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 268 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> So if one has attained such an exalted spiritual state, where could he possibly %0a> acquire fear? After all, he will not be able to ascend without it! Only if he takes %0a> fear from his past states! For the Partzuf retains the memories, records, recollec- %0a> tions of past states, even after its ascent to SAG, when BON become like SAG. %0a> %0a> If not for the recollections of fear from the past states, the Partzuf would %0a> not have been able to create a screen in a state when it has nothing left to fear. %0a> While explaining this, Rabbi Shimon told them of Havakuk, to teach them how %0a> to acquire fear, just as Havakuk did by taking fear from the past. %0a> %0a> THE DEEDS THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED... THROUGHOUT %0a> THE YEARS... WERE MY LIFE-because he lived through two periods: the %0a> years preceding his death and the years following his resurrection. Between %0a> these two periods, there was a state of exiting this world, death (during which %0a> he existed in the other world). That is to say, because I remember the time of %0a> my death, I thereby connect to life of the Upper World, which Elisha bestowed %0a> by resurrecting me. %0a> %0a> ZATde Atik is called the "past (sometimes ancient) years," since they receive %0a> their Light from Malchut of the world of AK, Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. %0a> However, ZAT de Atik do not shine upon the lower Partzufim and worlds with %0a> their Light of Tzimtzum Aleph. ZAT de Atik shine downward during the 6,000 %0a> years with diminished Light, restricting it according to the laws of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a> Only at the end of correction will they begin to pass down all of their Light. It is %0a> written in the Torah that the Light that Atik had passed during the 6,000 years %0a> is designated with the small letter Hey in the word Avraham. %0a> %0a> However, because Havakuk's death has purified him completely, since at the %0a> end of correction he merited merging with the "past years" of Atik, he received %0a> the required strength in Elisha's embraces and resurrection. It is hence written %0a> that after he has purified himself and felt fear at the moment of his death, the %0a> power of this fear enabled him to establish contact with ZAT de Atik and receive %0a> the Light called "eternal life." %0a> %0a> For having purified himself through death, BON received complete %0a> correction, upon ascending and becoming SAG at the time of death. Subsequently, %0a> it reaches the degree of Malchut de Malchut, a Zivug on which can only be made %0a> at the end of correction, and attains this degree, the Light of his life. %0a> %0a> 119. Rabbi Shimon wept and said: "And I have seen from the Creator what %0a> I have heard." He raised his hands above his head, and said: "But you have %0a> merited seeing Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the Light of the Torah, face to face, %0a> while I have not." He fell on his face and saw him who uproots mountains and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Donkey Driver %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 269 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lights candles in the Temple of the King (Mashiach). He said to him, "Rabbi, %0a> in the other world we shall be neighbors with the heads of the assemblies %0a> before the Creator." From here on, he called his son Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a> Aba by the name Pnei'el (the face of God), as it is written: "For I have seen %0a> the Creator face to face." %0a> %0a> He praised himself for using the same fear from the past, just like Proph- %0a> et Havakuk. %0a> %0a> All corrections are already ready and waiting in the hall of the King %0a> (Mashiach), down to the very last detail. They must all be revealed at the end of %0a> all corrections, with the appearance of the King. And the souls in that hall are %0a> those who merited completion of their individual corrections, for there is an %0a> individual correction and a general one. %0a> %0a> Malchut de Malchut is the only creation, and it is divided into parts called %0a> souls. These parts merge with people of our world, and each of them, while %0a> existing within man, must attain one's own correction, i.e., gradually replace %0a> one's properties (desires) with those of the Creator. This is considered the soul's %0a> individual or personal correction. So then, the souls that have attained their %0a> individual correction reach and exist in the state called "abiding in the hall of %0a> the King-Mashiach." %0a> %0a> The Light in that hall (the Light of the Torah), also called Hamnuna-Saba, %0a> completely liberates man from the impure forces, i.e., purifies him from all his %0a> primordial egoistic desires and corrects Malchut de Malchut, which "appears to %0a> the righteous as a high mountain" (Talmud, Sota, 52). This correction is made %0a> by creating a new SAG-like screen with the purpose of raising MAN (the request %0a> for final correction). MAN is called Me'orei Esh (sparkles of fire), as it is written: %0a> "Man's soul is the Creator's candle" (Mishley, 20:27). %0a> %0a> The light of the sun designates the Light's descent, MAD, just as sunlight %0a> descends upon us from Above, whereas a fire's flame signifies Ohr Hozer %0a> that rises from below upwards, like candlelight. The Zohar therefore says that %0a> these two corrections, aimed at destroying the impure forces and ascending to %0a> light the candles in the hall of the King-Mashiach, are in the hands of Rabbi %0a> Hamnuna-Saba. %0a> %0a> And the perfect righteous in need of these two final corrections merit %0a> receiving them only through revealing the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And %0a> he stated that they (the disciples of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba) will merit the %0a> honor of serving in the hall of the King-Mashiach after their death, and will %0a> become his neighbors and the heads of the Creator's Assembly. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Two Points %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 120. Rabbi Chiya began and opened, "The beginning of Hochma (wisdom) is %0a> fear of the Creator, and those who observe this rule receive all the goodness." %0a> He asks, "The beginning of wisdom? One should rather say that the end of %0a> wisdom is the fear of the Creator, for fear of the Creator is the property %0a> of Malchut, which is at the end of Hochma (wisdom)." He replies, "Yet, %0a> M.alchut is the beginning of the entrance to the degrees of reception of the %0a> Supernal wisdom." Hence, it is written, "Open to me the gates of justice," %0a> meaning that the gates of M.alchut, called "justice," are the Creator's gates. %0a> And if man does not enter these gates he shall not reach the Supernal King %0a> through any other, for He is concealed and detached, and has erected many %0a> gates on the path to Him. %0a> %0a> Fear of the Creator is the Sefira Malchut. Yet, how can Malchut serve as an %0a> entrance if she is the last of the ten SefirotJ Indeed, she may be called the end of %0a> Hochma or of a Partzuf, but not the beginning. However, this is not an allegorical %0a> expression, but the essence itself, for HE IS CONCEALED AND DETACHED %0a> and no thought of man can attain Him. Hence, He has put up many gates %0a> ON THE PATH TO HIM, and thanks to these gates He grants sufferers the %0a> opportunity to draw closer to him, the opportunity for attainment. %0a> %0a> This is precisely what the verse, "Open to me the gates of justice," (Tehilim, %0a> 118) alludes to; these are the very gates that the Creator made, through %0a> which people can come to Him. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF ALL THE %0a> GATES ERECTED A SPECIAL GATE WITH MANY LOCKS. This gate is %0a> Malchut de Malchut, the ultimate point of all creation, the ultimate point of %0a> all Supernal gates. %0a> %0a> And this last gate (from Above downwards) is the first gate to Supernal %0a> wisdom (from below upwards), for it is impossible to attain the Supernal Hochma %0a> %0a> 271 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 27 2 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (wisdom) without attaining precisely this final gate, as it is the first gate with %0a> regard to attainment of the Supernal wisdom. It is therefore written (Tehilim, %0a> 111:10): "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom," as fear of the Creator %0a> is called the final gate, which stands first on the path to Supernal attainment. %0a> %0a> 121. And at the end of all the gates He erected a special gate with several %0a> locks, several entrances, and several chambers, one atop of the other. And He %0a> said, "Whoever wishes to reach Me, let this be the first gate on his way to Me. %0a> Whoever enters through this gate— will enter." Only this is the first gate to the %0a> Supernal wisdom, the gate of fear of the Creator, Malchut, which is hence %0a> called "beginning." %0a> %0a> The locks, entrances, and chambers are three successive processes of %0a> attainment, of realizing the spiritual in one's inner sensation. The thought that %0a> created the world was the Creator's thought to make a creation (the human %0a> soul) in order to fill it with delight. However, it is impossible to feel delight as %0a> long as one is removed from the Creator, for He is the only One in existence. %0a> And He has created us in such a way that the nearer we come to Him, the greater %0a> delight we feel, whereas the farther we are from Him, the more we suffer. %0a> %0a> Those of us who live in and perceive only this world can only accept the above %0a> words on faith or reject them. However, Kabbalists, who ascend spiritually and %0a> draw closer to the Creator, make these assertions and describe their attainments %0a> for us. And as to how and when we shall travel the same path to the Creator and %0a> attain complete unity with Him, this depends on us alone. However, regardless %0a> of whether we want to or not, we will need to travel the entire path from our %0a> world to complete unity with the Creator while still existing in this body, during %0a> one of our lifetimes in this world. This is the purpose of creation, and until it is %0a> fulfilled, man must reincarnate and return to this world, as the sages said: "The %0a> Creator wished to dwell in the lower ones." %0a> %0a> Our world is built completely opposite from the Creator, as it was created %0a> in the property of egoistic will to receive pleasure, and this property is the exact %0a> antithesis to the Creator's property (desire) to delight us. Additionally, there is %0a> no trace of a will to receive pleasure in the Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> It is hence said about a person in our world: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" %0a> (lyov, 11:12). Therefore, to those who live in this world, the Creator's governance %0a> seems completely opposite to the purpose of creation— to delight the creatures. %0a> After all, that is how we perceive His rule over us, and feel the surrounding %0a> world in our egoistic sensations. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Two Points %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 273 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ding to the Creator's plan, one must correct his egoistic desires %0a> m altruistic, whereupon the Creator fulfills them with superr %0a> t (to the extent of their correction). Until one attains this stat %0a> esire to enjoy either this world or the spiritual. %0a> %0a> These sensations are called "gate locks," for all the numerous contradictior %0a> to the oneness of the Creator's actions that we feel in this world separate us %0a> from the Creator and prevent us from drawing closer to Him. However, when %0a> we exert to observe the To rah and Mitzvot with love, with our heart and soul, %0a> as devotedly as it was prescribed for us, with the sole intention of pleasing the %0a> eator and without any benefit for ourselves, all of the forces that separate %0a> Him and every contradiction that we overcome on our path to Him %0a> a gate of attainment of His Supernal wisdom, of Ohr Hochma. This is %0a> because every contradiction reveals its own uniqueness in the attainment of the %0a> Creator's governance. %0a> %0a> Thus, those very questions and contradictions, which initially seemed %0a> to prevent us from accepting the oneness of the Creator's governance, then %0a> turn into knowledge, thanks to which we come to understand and attain the %0a> oneness of His governance. %0a> %0a> And those who merit this transform darkness into Light (within themselves) %0a> and bitterness into sweetness. This is how they feel their attainments— in precisely %0a> those past sensations of darkness and bitterness. For the forces that repel us %0a> from the Creator, that form our minds and are perceived by the body as bitter %0a> turn into gates of attainment of Supernal Degrees. This way, darkness becomes %0a> Light and bitterness becomes sweetness. %0a> %0a> And the more negative the Creator's governance is first perceived, %0a> deeper man eventually comes to realize the perfection of His governance. At %0a> last, the entire world ends up on the scale of merit, for every force and insight %0a> now serve as SHAAREY TZEDEJC (the gates of truth), through which one can %0a> enter and receive from the Creator everything that He intended to bestow at the %0a> Thought of Creation. Thus, it is written about such contradictions that turn %0a> into realization of unity: "These are the gates to the Creator; the righteous shall %0a> %0a> Hence, until one merits turning his will "to receive for himself into the will %0a> "to receive for the Creator" with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot, all the gates %0a> to the Creator have sturdy locks (the sensation of imperfection in the Creator's %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ome %0a> , the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 274 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> eator. And they are called locks, for they lock the gates of > %0a> •eator and distance us from %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ;fore we %0a> Creator's %0a> yeetness %0a> ; e goism %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> awever, if we make efforts to overcon %0a> ikening our love for the Creator, we %0a> entrances, darkness into Light, and bitterness into sweetness. This is because %0a> for every lock we receive a special degree of attainment of the Creator. These %0a> degrees become entrances that lead to the degrees of sensation of the Creator %0a> Himself. And the degrees themselves turn into halls or chambers of wisdom. %0a> %0a> Thus, we see that locks, entrances, and chambers constitute the three types %0a> of perception of one material, our will to receive or egoism. Indeed, before we %0a> xe egoistic desire to receive into reception (of pleasure) for the Create %0a> ltruism, this material transforms Light into darkness and swe %0a> less, in accordance with our (egoistic) taste. In other words, %0a> finds suffering in the same types of influence that bring pleasure to altruism. %0a> Therefore, to perceive the Light (delight) that surrounds us, we only need %0a> to change our senses. But until we do, this Light will be perceived by us as %0a> darkness and suffering. %0a> %0a> Initially, whatever examples of the Creator's governance we see, they distance %0a> us from Him. This is because we perceive them negatively; at that very moment, %0a> our egoism (will to receive pleasure) begets locks. However, once we transform %0a> our desires to "reception for the Creator's sake," these locks become entrances, %0a> and entrances turn into chambers— vessels of wisdom, Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> As we already know, the end of all the degrees, i.e., the very last degree, %0a> below which nothing can possibly exist, is called Malchut de Malchut. To attain %0a> Supernal wisdom, one must first overcome this last gate, which turns into %0a> the first gate to ascend from below upwards, toward the chamber of Supernal %0a> wisdom, the Sefira Hochma. All gates become entrances and chambers of the %0a> Creator's wisdom. This is why it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (the first %0a> words in the Torah), for IN THE BEGINNING signifies fear of the Creator, %0a> the last gate (Malchut), which becomes the first on the path to attainment of the %0a> Supernal wisdom. %0a> %0a> 122. The letter Bet in the word BERESHEET (IN THE BEGINNING) %0a> indicates that the two are joined together in Malchut. Both are points: one %0a> is concealed, while the other is revealed. However, since there's no division %0a> between them, they are called THE BEGINNING, which signifies only one, %0a> rather than two, for he who takes one, takes the other as well, and all is one, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Two Points %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 275 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> for He and His Name are one, as it is written, "And you shall know that this %0a> is the Creator's only name." %0a> %0a> The Hebrew letter Bet has a numerical value of two, indicating two points. %0a> These two points symbolize the correction of the egoistic point of Malchut, %0a> onto which the point of mercy (Bina) imposes a restriction of use. Correction %0a> is achieved when Malchut (strictness) ascends to Bina (mercy), as it is written, %0a> "So they both walked" (Rut, 1:19), i.e., Bina and Malchut. Hence, the screen in %0a> Malchut consists of both points, and they are thereby joined together as one. %0a> %0a> It is explained in Megilat Rut (The Book of Ruth) how Malchut (Ruth) merges %0a> with Bina (Naomi), which then leads to the correction of Malchut and the %0a> birth of David, the first King (the word King (Melech) is derived from Malchut %0a> (kingdom) of Israel). %0a> %0a> HOWEVER, ONE IS CONCEALED, WHILE THE OTHER IS %0a> REVEALED, for the judgment in the point of Malchut is concealed, whereas %0a> only the property of mercy in the point of Bina is revealed. Otherwise, the world %0a> could not exist, as it is written, "In the beginning, He created the world with %0a> the property of judgment, but seeing that it cannot exist, He attached to it the %0a> property of mercy" (Beresheet Raba, item 1). %0a> %0a> Although the restriction is concealed, this does not mean that a Zivug is not %0a> made on it, since these two points merge into one, and the point of Malchut %0a> receives a Zivug together with the point of Bina, though it participates in it %0a> secretly. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING, for the word "beginning" %0a> indicates one point, which includes two that are as one. %0a> %0a> Because Malchut participates with Bina in all the Zivugim that are made %0a> during the 6,000 years (albeit secretly), she corrects herself to such an extent that %0a> at the end of all the corrections, even her property of restriction is corrected, %0a> and she acquires the property of Bina. It is written of this state that on that day %0a> He and His Name will be one. %0a> %0a> Since the properly of restriction is also concealed within the letter Bet of %0a> the word BERESHEET (in the beginning), this property is called RESHEET %0a> (first) in Hochma (wisdom). However, the correction of this property occurs %0a> only at the end of corrections, when the Supernal wisdom is revealed, as the %0a> prophet said: "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Creator" %0a> (Yeshayahu, 11:9). This is because the last gate will become the first. Hence, it is %0a> written, "That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the Lord, the %0a> Most High over all the earth," (Tehilim, 83:19) for the Creator's wisdom will be %0a> revealed in our world to all. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 276 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 123. Why is Malchut called "fear of the Creator?" It is because Malchut is the %0a> Tree of Good and Evil: If man merits, it is good, but if he does not, it is evil. %0a> This is why fear dwells in that place. And this gate leads to all the goodness %0a> that exists in the world. ALL THE GOODNESS signifies two gates, two points %0a> that are as one. Rabbi Yosi said that ALL THE GOODNESS refers to the Tree %0a> of Life, for it is entirely good and completely without evil. And because it is %0a> without evil, it is entirely good, without evil. %0a> %0a> It is written of the last gate: THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS FEAR %0a> OF THE CREATOR. So why is it called "fear of the Creator?" Because this %0a> is the secret of the Tree of Knowledge, by which Adam sinned, for the use of %0a> that point (egoistic desires) is punishable by death (disappearance of the Light). %0a> And great fear is needed to refrain from touching (using) it before all the other %0a> desires have been corrected. Nevertheless, at the end of correction, when even %0a> this point is completely corrected, death will cease to exist for all eternity. That %0a> is why it is called "fear." %0a> %0a> The Creator created one creation— the egoistic Malchut. The goal of creation %0a> is to fill her with the Creator's Light using an altruistic intention. As a result, %0a> Malchut merges with the Creator and receives limitless delight. %0a> %0a> Malchut, the only creation, consists of five parts: KHB ZAM. Her parts %0a> KHB ZA, excluding Malchut de Malchut, have altruistic properties, which they %0a> received from the Light. %0a> %0a> As a result of her decision to refrain from receiving Light into egoistic %0a> desires, called T^imt^um Aleph (the first restriction), Malchut receives the Light %0a> only in her first four desires: KHB-ZA. Malchut de Malchut remains inaccessible %0a> to the Light. So how can she be corrected? %0a> %0a> To correct Malchut de Malchut's properties (desires), the Creator creates %0a> the conditions under which Bina and Malchut mix, and consequently, Malchut %0a> acquires the properties of Bina. %0a> %0a> This process needs to occur more than once, so that all of Malchut 's parts %0a> will be mixed with Bina. Every time it takes place in an increasingly deeper layer %0a> of Malchut, it is called the breaking of holiness, for Bina descends and passes %0a> her properties to Malchut, but she herself breaks during this mixing, as though %0a> losing her altruistic properties. %0a> %0a> Thus, we can conclude that all the shattering of vessels, the breaking of %0a> Adam's soul, the ruin of the First and Second Temples, and other spiritual %0a> disasters take place not as punishment, for punishment (as we understand it) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Two Points %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 277 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> does not exist in the spiritual, but only so as to enable the altruistic desires of %0a> Bina penetrate deeper into the egoistic desires of Malchut. %0a> %0a> The last point of Malchut, the yet uncorrected Malchut de Malchut, is that %0a> very point the use of which is punishable by death (the Light's disappearance is %0a> considered death). It is forbidden to use Malchut de Malchut until all the other %0a> properties of Malchut (KHB-ZA) have been fully corrected. Or rather, if man %0a> refrains from using egoism (the point of Malchut de Malchut), and uses only %0a> his other altruistic desires, he gradually constructs a "non-reception" screen on %0a> Malchut de Malchut. %0a> %0a> Having filled all of his corrected desires with Light, man achieves the end %0a> of correction— of what he could correct by himself. As soon as that happens, %0a> i.e., as soon as one receives the Light in all of his soul's first nine Sefirot (KHB- %0a> ZA, excluding Malchut), the Light called Mashiach descends from Above, which %0a> imparts Malchut de Malchut with the altruistic property of bestowal, of acting for %0a> the Creator's sake. This concludes the entire correction process of man's soul, %0a> and he attains complete unity with the Creator. The Creator's goal is for man %0a> to attain this state while still living in our world and in his physical body, to %0a> combine all the worlds, spiritual and material, within himself. %0a> %0a> AND THIS GATE LEADS TO ALL THE GOODNESS, for there is nothing %0a> better than the revelation of the Supernal wisdom in the world, included in %0a> the Thought of Creation. And since fear of the Creator is the last gate to the %0a> Supernal wisdom, it also constitutes the gate to all the goodness. %0a> %0a> THESE TWO GATES ARE AS ONE refers to the two points, Bina and %0a> Malchut, which are united in the letter Bet of the word BERESHEET (IN THE %0a> BEGINNING), the first word in the Torah. And the two points are mentioned %0a> because they allude to the state following the correction, when these two points %0a> are called "the two gates," for both turn out to be good and free from evil, %0a> thereby bringing man only perfect goodness. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, until the end of correction, one must strain to separate within %0a> him the desires that refer to the point of Bina from those that refer to the point %0a> of Malchut, to reject the desires of Malchut, and, in defiance of egoism, use %0a> the desires of Bina. During man's work on self-correction, called "6,000 years," %0a> these two points are referred to as "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a> %0a> RABBI YOSI SAID-Rabbi Yosi does not object to the words of Rabbi Chiya. %0a> They are talking about two different states: Rabbi Chiya alludes to a state past %0a> the end of correction of Malchut, when both points become a gate, and there %0a> is no more evil within them. And Rabbi Yosi explains a state in the correction %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 278 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> process, when the two points, Bina and Malchut, exist within us as our Tree of %0a> Knowledge of Good and Evil. Hence, he tells us that ALL THE GOODNESS %0a> IS (can only be found in) THE TREE OF LIFE. %0a> %0a> ZA filled with the Light of Ima-Bina is called "The Tree of Life," for he %0a> possesses only good properties. And the two points of good and evil, Bina and %0a> Malchut, remain within Malchut until the end of correction; hence, Malchut is %0a> called "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a> %0a> 124. To all those who act, it is the faithful mercy of David that upholds the %0a> Torah. Those who keep the Torah seemingly create it themselves. All those who %0a> study the Torah— there is no action in them as they study, but those who keep %0a> the Torah— in them there is action. And the world exists by this force, eternal %0a> are the wisdom and the Torah, and the throne stands just as it should stand. %0a> %0a> It was previously said that fear of the Creator constitutes the last gate, though %0a> it is the first gate to the Supernal wisdom. It turns out that ALL THOSE WHO %0a> STUDY THE TORAH have already corrected the last gate, and the two points %0a> become for them two entrances, all goodness without evil. Hence, it is said that %0a> THERE IS NO ACTION IN THEM, i.e., no analysis of good and evil, for they %0a> have already corrected everything. %0a> %0a> However, those who have not yet reached the end of correction are referred %0a> to as those who keep the Torah. There is action in them, for they have not yet %0a> corrected good and evil in everyone's Tree of Good and Evil— not everyone has %0a> realized in one's inner tree (in all of one's properties) what is good and what is %0a> evil with regard to the spiritual truth. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said that THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH SEEMINGLY %0a> CREATE IT THEMSELVES. As a result of man's effort to refrain from their %0a> use, all the distracting and impeding forces (thoughts and desires) of the point %0a> of Malchut become gates, all the locks become entrances, and all the entrances %0a> become chambers of wisdom filled with Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> It follows that all the wisdom and the entire Torah become revealed only %0a> through the efforts of those who keep the Torah. Hence, they SEEMINGLY %0a> CREATE IT THEMSELVES. The forces of good and evil are combined within %0a> them, and they become those who keep the Torah, for the Torah is revealed %0a> thanks to their inner work of separating and correcting good and evil. %0a> %0a> Such people are called "those who act," for they seemingly create the Torah %0a> by themselves. After all, without perceiving the Creator (The Torah, Light) as %0a> concealed, and then overcoming this concealment, thereby turning it into gates, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Two Points %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 279 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The perfection of the Creator's actions lies in the fact that by creating man %0a> so paltry (with such insignificant egoistic desires, completely opposite to the %0a> Creator in his properties, and utterly powerless to change himself), the Creator %0a> gave man an opportunity to become like Him (in properties, greatness, and the %0a> sensation of creating himself), to create within and by himself all of the worlds %0a> and the Torah. By revealing the Light, it is as though man actually creates it. %0a> %0a> Thus, since these individuals reveal the Torah, they are regarded as its %0a> creators. The word is SEEMINGLY used to indicate that the Torah was created %0a> before the creation of our world (Talmud, Pesachim, 54:1), and of course, it is the %0a> work of the Creator Himself. Yet, without the good deeds of those who keep the %0a> Torah, it would not have been revealed to the world. Hence, they are regarded %0a> as the makers and creators of the Torah. %0a> %0a> The wisdom and the Torah are eternal; that is, they exist even after the %0a> end of correction, for fear of the Creator is needed even then. However, once %0a> the entire egoism is corrected, there is no place from which to take this fear, %0a> for the Tree of Good and Evil becomes only good, and can no longer furnish %0a> fear of the Creator. %0a> %0a> However, because they received fear in the past, they can continue using it %0a> in the present, after the end of correction, when there is nothing left to fear, as %0a> there are no restrictions in Malchut. And the only reason they can do so is that %0a> during the correction they worked on creating within them the sensation of the %0a> Creator's absolute rule and the eternity of the Torah. And since this fear is never- %0a> ending, the Creator's throne remains forever standing in their attainment. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 125. Rabbi Shimon was sitting and studying the Torah on the night when the %0a> Bride, Malchut, unites with her husband, Zeir Anpin. And all the friends %0a> present in the bridal chamber on that night, the eve of the holiday of Shavuot %0a> (Pentecost), must stand together with the bridegroom under the Huppah %0a> (wedding canopy), and be with him this whole night, and rejoice with him %0a> in the corrections of the Bride, i.e., study the Torah, then Prophets, then %0a> Holy Scriptures, and finally the wisdom, for these corrections are the Bride's %0a> adornments. And the Bride receives corrections, adorns herself with them, %0a> and rejoices with them all of that night. And on the next day, on the holiday of %0a> Shavuot, she only comes to the Huppah together with them. And her friends, %0a> who studied the Torah all night long, are called the sons of the Huppah. And as %0a> she approaches the Huppah, the Creator asks about them, blesses and adorns %0a> them with the Bride's adornments. Happy are those who merit this! %0a> %0a> All the days of exile are called night, for this is when the Creator's face is %0a> concealed from Israel, as the impure forces rule and separate His loyal servants %0a> from Him. Yet, this is the time when the bride unites with her husband (in %0a> Hebrew, "husband" and "master" are the same word, so one must keep in mind %0a> the second meaning of the word as well). The Huppah is a wedding canopy, under %0a> which the ritual of union between a bride and a bridegroom (their merging in %0a> a Zivug) takes place. %0a> %0a> The union between the bride and her husband (The Zohar uses the word %0a> "husband" instead of "bridegroom") occurs thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot %0a> (commandments) of the righteous, referred to as "those who keep the Torah." %0a> And all the Supernal Degrees, called "secrets of the Torah," become revealed %0a> thanks to them alone, for they are also called MAKERS (as though CREATING %0a> the Torah itself), as is described in item 124. Therefore, the time of exile is called %0a> the NIGHT WHEN THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER HUSBAND. AND %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 281 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 282 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ALL THE FRIENDS, THE SONS OF THE BRIDE'S JOY, ARE CALLED %0a> THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH. %0a> %0a> And after THE END OF CORRECTION and complete deliverance, of %0a> which the prophet Zachariah writes (14:7): "And there shall be one day, which %0a> shall be known to the Creator, neither day nor night, but it shall come to pass %0a> come evening time: there shall be light." THE NEXT DAY, THE BRIDE AND %0a> HER HUSBAND ENTER THE HUPPAH, for BON will become like SAG and %0a> MA will be like AB (see item 64). %0a> %0a> This state is therefore defined as the next day and a new Huppah. Whereas %0a> at this time (in this state), the righteous are called SONS OF THE HUPPAH, %0a> in whom there is no action, for then, as it is written: "They shall not do evil %0a> upon My holy mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the %0a> Creator, as waters cover the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a> %0a> And since these righteous elevated BON to SAG by their actions, i.e., made %0a> its properties similar to those of SAG, they are considered to have made a new %0a> Huppah, they are called "sons of the Huppah." %0a> %0a> The night of Shavuot (Pentecost) is when THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER %0a> HUSBAND, for the Huppah takes place on the next day, the day of Shavuot, the %0a> day of the reception of the Torah. On that day, all of creation achieves the state %0a> of the end of correction, as it is said: "He will swallow up death forever; and the %0a> Creator Himself will wipe away the tears off all faces" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a> %0a> The Torah describes this state as "engraved upon the scrolls" (Shemot, 32: 16). %0a> In Hebrew, the word "engraved" is Harut, but it should be pronounced Herut %0a> (freedom), freedom from the angel of death. However, the sin of the golden calf %0a> followed and the High Degree was lost. Since Shavuot is the day when the Torah %0a> was received, it is also regarded as the end of correction. %0a> %0a> Therefore, all the necessary preparations (the corrections carried out %0a> during the concealment period) are completed beforehand, on the night %0a> before the holiday of Shavuot. This night is hence defined as the night when %0a> the bride unites with her husband so as to enter the Huppah the following %0a> day, on the holiday of Shavuot, when all the corrections are completed and %0a> liberated from the angel of death, thanks to the actions of the righteous, who %0a> erect a new Hu£>£>ah. %0a> %0a> All of the bride's friends, those who keep the Torah, also called "sons of %0a> the bridal chamber," must be merged with the Shechina-Malchut (the bride) all %0a> of that night, called "exile." Only then do their acts in the Torah and Mitzvot %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 283 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> correct and purify the good in her from the taint of evil, so she would emerge %0a> with the properties that contain only good, without evil. %0a> %0a> Hence, those who keep the Torah should rejoice together with the bride %0a> for all the great corrections that they've made in her. Then they joyously %0a> continue with their corrections in THE TORAH, then in PROPHETS and %0a> finally in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. All the degrees and revelations of the %0a> secrets of the Torah, which make up the framework of the Shechina herself at %0a> the end of her correction, are made exclusively by the righteous, who keep the %0a> Torah during the exile. %0a> %0a> Therefore, all the degrees that emerge at the time (state) of the exile are %0a> called the bride's corrections and adornments from the Torah, Prophets and %0a> Holy Scriptures, for Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet constitute the Torah, Sefirot %0a> Net^ah, Hod, and Yesod are the Prophets, and Malchut is the Holy Scriptures. The %0a> Light of VAK is called Midrashim and the Light of GAR is called "the secrets of %0a> the Torah." And all these corrections must be made in Malchut (the bride) on %0a> the night when she completes her corrections (precisely in the darkness of exile %0a> from the spiritual does man carry out the work of his inner correction). %0a> %0a> It is known that the end of correction does not bring anything new or that %0a> was previously unknown. Rather, all the MAN and MAD, along with all degrees %0a> and Zivugim that have emerged consecutively during the 6,000 years will merge %0a> into one degree and become corrected with the help of the Light of Atik. %0a> %0a> The bride will then enter her Huppah, and THE CREATOR WILL ASK %0a> ABOUT EVERYONE, about every man who had even once raised MAN for the %0a> Supernal, final Zivug. For the Creator waits for all the small Zivugim to assemble, %0a> as though asking about and waiting for each of them. And when they've %0a> gathered, a great Zivug will unfold, called RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL (HE %0a> WHO BLESSES AND ADORNS HER). And when all the creatures are blessed %0a> and adorned together, correction comes to an end. This is referred to as "the %0a> adornment of the bride's crown." %0a> %0a> 126. This is why Rabbi Shimon and all of his friends stayed up that night, %0a> and each of them renewed the Torah again and again. Rabbi Shimon was %0a> joyous, and so were his friends. Rabbi Shimon said to them: "My sons, how %0a> blessed is your lot, for it is you who shall accompany the Bride tomorrow %0a> to the Huppah, for all those who correct Her and rejoice in Her this night %0a> shall have their names recorded in the Book of Remembrance. And the %0a> Creator shall bless them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns %0a> of the Upper World." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 284 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Book of Remembrance, mentioned by the prophet (Malachi, 3:15): "You %0a> will say, 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's %0a> will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all? And now %0a> we regard the wicked as blessed: they have settled in their wickedness, tried the %0a> Creator, and were liberated.' Then those who feared the Creator spoke with %0a> each other, and the Creator hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance %0a> was recorded before Him for those who fear the Creator and honor His Name. %0a> 'They shall become chosen for Me on the day that I shall determine, and I shall %0a> spare them, as a man spares his own son, who serves him.'" %0a> %0a> But how can we understand that when they spoke ill of the Creator, %0a> they referred to fear of the Creator, as the prophet says? Moreover, they were %0a> inscribed in the Book of Remembrance as those who "feared the Creator and %0a> honored His Name?" %0a> %0a> The thing is that at the end of correction, when the great general Zivug %0a> of AtiJc manifests, great Light will be revealed in all the worlds, and in this %0a> Light everyone will return to the Creator in absolute love. The Talmud (Yoma, %0a> 86:2, "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot") says: "He who attains the %0a> repentance from love shall have his sins turned to merits." %0a> %0a> Here, the prophet refers to the sinners claiming the futility of spiritual %0a> work: on the great day of the end of correction, when the Light of repentance %0a> from love shall shine, all the most malicious and deliberate, worst imaginable %0a> sins, will turn to merits, and their words shall be deemed not slight, but fear %0a> of the Creator. %0a> %0a> Therefore, all the sins, as well as all the good deeds, are recorded before the %0a> Creator, for He will need them on that great day of His miracle: all the merits %0a> gather and complete the Kli, which receives the Light necessary for the final %0a> correction. Hence, it is said that the Creator shall record the names of those %0a> who fear Him in the Book of Remembrance, for He will need them on that day %0a> to complete the common Partzuf. This is exactly what the prophet says: those %0a> who remain shall be close to the Creator, like sons who served Him. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said that everyone and everything will be recorded in the %0a> Book of Remembrance, even the sins. However, The Creator will record them %0a> as though they are merits, as though they served Him. These are the words of %0a> the prophet. %0a> %0a> The number seventy signifies the Light of Hochma, GAR, adornment, a %0a> crown, and the Light of Hassadim is called "a blessing," for the world was created %0a> with the letter Bet (blessing), as it is written: "The world was built by mercy" %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 285 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (Tehilim, 89:3), which is VAK. But at the end of correction, the Light of Hassadim %0a> will also be like seventy crowns, like the Light of Hochma, for MA and BON will %0a> ascend to AB and SAG. Therefore, The Zohar says that the Creator will bless %0a> them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns of the Upper World. %0a> %0a> 127. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "The Heavens declare the Creator's %0a> greatness. I have already explained this, but when the bride awakens to enter %0a> the Huppah on the following day, with all the friends who rejoiced with her %0a> through that night, she rejoices with them, corrects herself and shines with %0a> her adornments." %0a> %0a> 128. And on the following day, a multitude of masses, hosts, and legions %0a> join her. And she, together with all these masses, hosts and legions, awaits %0a> all those who corrected her by studying the Torah on that night. This is so %0a> because Zeir Anpin unites with Malchut, and she sees her husband, and %0a> it is said: "The Heavens declare the Creator's greatness." "The Heavens" %0a> alludes to the Bridegroom (ZA), who enters the Huppah. "The Heavens %0a> declare," i.e., shine, like the luminescence of a sapphire, upon the entire %0a> Malchut, from end to end. %0a> %0a> The day of the end of correction is called "tomorrow," as it is written in %0a> the Talmud: "Do today, and receive the reward tomorrow" (Eruvin, 22:1). The %0a> masses are the worldly masses who do not serve the Creator, the hosts are those %0a> who serve the Creator, and the legions are chariots of warriors in armor— the %0a> Supernal groups of angels that accompany the souls, as it is said: "For He bid %0a> His angels to guard over you on all your paths" (Tehilim, 91:11). Just as the %0a> Creator waits for everyone, as was previously stated, so does the Shechina. %0a> %0a> "Heavens" is the bridegroom entering the Huppah— the state of the end of %0a> correction, of which it is written: "And the light of the moon (Malchut) shall %0a> be as the light of the sun (ZA)" (Yeshayahu, 30:26). The Creator is called the %0a> "Heavens," and at the end of correction He is referred to as the "bridegroom," %0a> as it is said: "Just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so shall your Creator %0a> rejoice over you." (Yeshayahu, 62:5). %0a> %0a> Wherever it is said that the Creator descends, it indicates His strictness %0a> and judgment, for it speaks of diminishing His greatness in the eyes of the %0a> lower ones, as it is said: "His might and greatness are in His place." But at the %0a> end of correction, when all sins turn to merits, for it will become clear that all %0a> the spiritual descents were nothing other than spiritual ascents, the Creator %0a> becomes the "bridegroom" and the Shechina becomes his "bride." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 286 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Hebrew word for "bride" is Kalah, as in the words KalatMoshe (Bamidbar, %0a> 7), which describes the completion of the altar. Hence, in the Torah, the word %0a> Kalah signifies the end of construction. The Hebrew word for "bridegroom" %0a> is Hatan, and it signifies the descent along spiritual degrees, as it is said in the %0a> Talmud: "Descends the steps" (Yevamot, 63:1). However, this descent is greater %0a> than all the previous ascents, for it takes place on the way towards the bride at %0a> the moment of the end of correction. %0a> %0a> The Huppah represents the total of all the Returning Light received on the %0a> MAN raised by the righteous in all the Zivugim at all the times during the 6,000 %0a> years. This is because now they have all gathered into one great Returning Light, %0a> rising and soaring over the Creator and the Shechina, over the bridegroom and %0a> his bride, like a Huppah— wedding canopy. %0a> %0a> In this state, the righteous are called "Sons of the Huppah," for each of %0a> them has a part in this Huppah, to the extent of the MAN they raise to the %0a> screen of Malchut, which evoked, produced the Returning Light, corresponding %0a> in magnitude to this MAN. At the end of correction, the Creator is called Hatan %0a> (bridegroom), for He Nechit Darga— descends from His degree to his bride, and %0a> enters the Huppah. %0a> %0a> At this time (in this state), the Heavens say— this is a great Zivug of the future, %0a> as the Talmud says: "The wife speaks to her husband" (Berachot, 3:1). The word %0a> "speaks" (Mesaperet) implies a Zivug, and is derived from Sapir (sapphire), the %0a> name of the Shechina, as it is said in the Torah, "...and under His feet— like a %0a> pavement of sapphire" (Shemot, 24:10). %0a> %0a> THE LUMINESCENT SAPPHIRE is the Returning Light, ascending from %0a> below upwards. LUMINESCENT, LIKE LUMINESCENCE— The Returning %0a> Light, LUMINESCENT is equivalent to the Direct Light, LUMINESCENCE. %0a> This great Zivug gathers all of the Returning Light from all the Zivugim made %0a> during the 6,000 years, and the Direct Light will shine in it, as it is said, FROM %0a> END TO END. %0a> %0a> 129. The Creator's glory = EL— is the bride, Malchut, called EL, as it is %0a> written: "EL rages each day." She is called EL on all the days of the year. And %0a> now, on the holiday of Shavuot, when she already entered the Huppah, she %0a> is called GREATNESS and she is called EL, greatest of the great, luminescent %0a> out of the luminescent, dominion over dominions. %0a> %0a> El is the name of great mercy. Yet, here it says: "El rages each day," which is %0a> contrary to mercy. The Torah says: "And there shall be evening, and there shall %0a> be morning, one day." The Shechina is a small star, the Moon, which reigns at %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 287 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> night. It is called "fear of Heaven," for it is the property of the righteous, who %0a> must raise MAN through their aspiration to be corrected, thereby evoking the %0a> Returning Light to descend on Malchut from Above and correct her. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written: "The Creator hath made it so man would fear Him" %0a> (Kohelet, 3:14). This is so because it is impossible to raise the MAN without fear. %0a> The absence of fear of the Creator is referred to as Malchut's reign at night, in %0a> the state of darkness. In the absence of Light, all the restrictions and suffering %0a> are revealed, as they are opposite to the property of day, mercy. Thus, fear of the %0a> Creator emerges; were it not for this fear, the property of morning and day could %0a> not be revealed. %0a> %0a> So it is written: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, %0a> one day." Night also enters morning, for without a night, there would be no %0a> morning, and one cannot do without night. It is hence written that EL RAGES %0a> EACH DAY. After all, the property of mercy, called EL, is revealed only with the %0a> help of the night, through the property of RAGE. Hence, this property is also %0a> regarded as mercy; and consequently, the Shechina is called EL. %0a> %0a> This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S GREATNESS = EL-IS THE %0a> BRIDE, MALCHUT, CALLED EL, for it is impossible to achieve the state of %0a> "day" without the state of "night." So it is in each of the six days of creation, of %0a> which it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one %0a> day." We see that the night is included in the name "day." And just as they are %0a> all called the six DAYS of creation, the 6,000 years are called "night" in the %0a> property of mercy. %0a> %0a> And in the great Zivug at the end of correction, a day shall come; the light of %0a> the moon will become like that of the sun, as the prophet said (Zachariah, 14:7): %0a> "It shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light." This will cause %0a> the degrees of Malchut to increase twofold, for even during the 6,000 years, the %0a> light of the moon was according to the aforesaid, "And there shall be evening, %0a> and there shall be morning." %0a> %0a> And at the end of correction, when the moon becomes like the sun (ZA), %0a> the moon will be twice as great as before, as it will become greatness itself, for %0a> its greatness will equal that of ZA, of which The Zohar says: THE GREATEST %0a> OF THE GREAT, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS. Although it merged %0a> with the light of the morning during the 6,000 years, as it is said, "And there %0a> shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one day," now that it is as big %0a> as the sun (ZA), it becomes Light, itself, LUMINESCENT OUT OF THE %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 288 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> LUMINESCENT. Previously, its Light was solely the result of the inclusion of %0a> the properties of Higher Sefirot into it. %0a> %0a> Also, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS, for during the 6,000 years, its %0a> reign was that of a small star, reigning only at night. Now, however, it also reigns %0a> during the day, for it is as big as the sun. %0a> %0a> 130. The hour when the Heaven (ZA) enters the Huppah and shines upon %0a> MalcHwt, all of her friends, who corrected her by studying the Torah, are %0a> known by their names, as it is said: "The Heavens declare the work of His %0a> hands." "The work of His hands" refers to the members of this covenant, %0a> called "the work of His hands." As you say: "Confirm for us the work of our %0a> hands," which is the mark of the covenant, imprinted on man's body. %0a> %0a> "Friends" are those who keep the Torah, which includes both good and %0a> evil deeds, even those parts of them that are still evil and uncorrected; EACH %0a> IS KNOWN BY A NAME (his corrected part), as it is said: THE HEAVENS %0a> DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. "Heavens" is the Book of Remem- %0a> brance, which constitutes the Light of the great Zivug that leads to repentance %0a> (correction) out of love, when sins become merits (Talmud, Yoma, 86:2). %0a> %0a> And even those who were speaking ill things, it is said about them: "Then %0a> they shall impart their fear of the Creator upon one another" (item 126). %0a> Therefore, the action defined as "upholding the Torah," which includes both %0a> good (for the worthy) and evil (for the unworthy), now becomes completely %0a> good and holy. And it turns into THE WORK OF HIS HANDS-the Creator's %0a> actions, for THE HEAVENS SPEAK even of the unworthy. It turns out that all %0a> the friends have performed only good deeds and carried out holy work, for they %0a> would all correct Malchut, and ALL ARE KNOWN BY THEIR NAMES. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said: CONFIRM FOR US THE WORK OF OUR HANDS %0a> (Tehilim, 90:17). However, it is unclear whose hands are meant: His or ours? Only %0a> one thing is meant here— that the covenant is referred to as "the work of our hands," %0a> for its confirmation is Yesod (Yesod is not only the name of a Sefira, it also means %0a> "basis," "foundation" in Hebrew), the foundation of the entire construction. %0a> %0a> The correction of Yesod is Brit Milah (circumcision). Hence, it is said that %0a> the existence of the covenant is called "the work of our hands," for we separate %0a> the Orlah (foreskin) from Yesod through the work of our hands. But this only %0a> concerns the period up to the end of correction. And at the end of correction, %0a> THE WORK OF HIS HANDS will be revealed. In other words, the Creator %0a> Himself will detach the Orlah from us, and THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE %0a> WORK OF HIS HANDS. But until that state comes, we are entrusted with the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 289 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> correction of the circumcision. Therefore, we ask: CONFIRM FOR US THE %0a> WORK OF OUR HANDS. %0a> %0a> 131. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba then said as follows: "Do not let your mouth cause %0a> your body to sin," i.e., one must not allow his mouth to get close to evil and be %0a> the cause of sin for the sacred flesh, which bears the mark of the holy covenant %0a> with the Creator. If he does so, he shall be dragged to hell. And the ruler of %0a> hell, called Domeh, stands at the gates of hell with hundreds of thousands of %0a> angels, but he is forbidden to approach those who have kept the holy covenant %0a> in this world. %0a> %0a> There is a warning here: let each man be careful of what he utters, so that %0a> his prayer is pure when he raises MAN with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a> If the impure force clings to his prayer, it will receive his MAN. As a result, %0a> man will develop a grudge against the Creator and foreign thoughts, thereby %0a> causing the Orlah to once again cling to the holy covenant. Consequently, %0a> his holy soul will fall into the captivity of the impure forces, and they will %0a> drag it to hell. This is similar to what Rabbi Elazar said about falling into %0a> Lilit's hands (item 68). %0a> %0a> THE SACRED FLESH, WHICH BEARS THE MARK OF THE HOLY %0a> COVENANT alludes to the holy soul guarded by the holy covenant, as it is said: %0a> "From my flesh I shall see the Creator," i.e., from my nature, my properties. Yet, %0a> doubts evoke the return of the impure force of the Orlah. It touches the holy %0a> covenant, and the Divine soul is instantly driven away. Hence, "The Tree cried %0a> out: Sinner, do not touch me," for this Tree is Yesod, Ateret Yesod (foreskin— the %0a> very essence of creation, egoism), the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a> %0a> DOMEH, THE RULER OF HELL— DOMEH is derived from Dmamah- %0a> lifelessness, for he robs man of his soul and leaves him lifeless. This is the angel %0a> that fills man's heart with doubts regarding the Creator's greatness, and creates %0a> within him a sinful desire to perceive His plans as though they were plans of one %0a> born of a woman, i.e., as though they were of this world. And since he likens the %0a> Creator's thoughts in man's perception to those of man, he is named so (Domeh %0a> also means likeness, similarity). %0a> %0a> At first, man understands that the Creator's thoughts and ways are different %0a> from ours, for the created mind can grasp neither Him nor His thoughts nor %0a> His governance, as our mind is inferior to His. But, through sin, the angel %0a> Domeh plants a silly spirit within man, which forces him to say that the mind %0a> of one born of a woman is similar to the Creator's. This leaves man open to %0a> doubts, which DRAG HIM TO HELL. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 290 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, the power of the angel Domeh is in his name, as it is said: "Who %0a> is as mighty as You, who is LIKE You, the King that kills and resurrects?" This %0a> indicates that the connection with the one who is LIKE him leads to death, %0a> whereas in the realization that there is none like Him, man finds life. %0a> %0a> However, the doubts and thoughts that man receives from the angel Domeh %0a> are countless, as The Zohar says, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANGELS %0a> ARE WITH HIM, and they are all standing at the gates of hell, through which %0a> man is dragged there, though the gates themselves are not yet considered hell. %0a> %0a> BUT HE (THE ANGEL) IS FORBIDDEN TO APPROACH THOSE %0a> WHO HAVE KEPT THE HOLY COVENANT IN THIS WORLD. And even if %0a> one did not fully keep (observe) the covenant, and there is still good and evil in %0a> his deeds, he is nonetheless regarded as one who has kept the holy covenant. So, %0a> unless one comes to doubt, the angel Domeh is forbidden to drag him to hell. %0a> %0a> 132. When this happened to King David, fear enveloped him. Right then, %0a> Domeh ascended before the Creator, and said: "Master of the world, it says in %0a> the To rah (Vayikra, 20:10): 'And the man that commits adultery with another %0a> man's wife...' David broke his covenant, is it not so?" The Creator replied to %0a> him: "David is righteous, and his holy covenant remains pure, for it is known %0a> to Me that Bat Sheva was destined for him since the creation of the world." %0a> %0a> Although David committed no sin, as the Talmud explains (Shabbat, 56: 1) that %0a> he who says that David sinned is wrong, he was enveloped with fear nonetheless, %0a> as if he really had sinned, for Domeh cited the Torah in his complaint. %0a> %0a> However, Bat Sheva had been destined for David since the creation of the %0a> world (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 107:1); thus, he did not violate his covenant. Yet, if Bat %0a> Sheva had been destined for David, why was she first married to Uriah? After all, %0a> a wife is half of her husband's body. And if she is half of David's body, how could %0a> Uriah have taken her, if there is nothing in him that corresponds with her? %0a> %0a> The fact is that Bat Sheva is David's true Nukva (female) from the day of the %0a> creation of the world, for David is the male part of Malchut, while Bat Sheva %0a> is the Nukva in Malchut. But since, as the world was being created, Malchut %0a> ascended to Bina to receive the property of mercy (bestowal) from her, Bat Sheva, %0a> too, required this correction in GAR. Without it she could not have given birth %0a> to the soul of King Solomon. %0a> %0a> And Uriah the Hittite was an exalted soul, the properties of GAR, wherefrom %0a> the name "Uriah," which consists of Ur = Ohr (Light) and i(a)h = i (Yod) + h (Hey) = %0a> the first two letters of the Creator's Name HaVaYaH, is derived. In other words, %0a> Uriah signifies "the Creator's Light." And the fact that his name contains only %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 291 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the first two letters Yod-Hey = Hochma-Bina, and lacks the last two letters Vav- %0a> Hey = ZA-Malchut indicates that his Light is the Light of GAR. Therefore, to %0a> correct Bat Sheva in the property of mercy, she was joined with Uriah. As a %0a> result, she became fit for queenship, and became the Queen of Israel. %0a> %0a> 133. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, what is revealed to You is %0a> concealed from him." The Creator answered: "Whatever David did was done %0a> with My permission. For no man goes to war without first giving his wife a get %0a> (document of divorce)." Domeh then said: "But if this is so, David should have %0a> waited three months, which he did not." The Creator replied: "This extension %0a> is only necessary to make certain that the woman is not pregnant from her %0a> previous husband. But it is known to Me that Uriah never went near her, for %0a> My Name is imprinted in him as testimony. Indeed, Uriah is Ohr'lah, the %0a> Creator's Light, though it is written Uriahu = Ohr + i + a + hu (Yod-Hey-Vav), %0a> without the last Hey, MalcHut, which proves that he did not use Malcfutt." %0a> %0a> The letters Yod-Hey in Uriah's name (Aleph-Reish-Yod-Hey) indicate that he %0a> had never touched Bat Sheva. This is because Uriah refers to GAR without %0a> VAK. And The Zohar emphasizes that whenever VAK is used, the name Uriahu %0a> is applied. However, it is written here that Uriah was Bat Sheva's first husband, %0a> meaning that he had nothing of VAK in him, but only GAR— the Light of Hochma %0a> without the Light of Hassadim, for Vav signifies Hassadim. This is why he could %0a> not come near Bath Sheba. %0a> %0a> 134. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, this is exactly what I have %0a> said: if You knew that Uriah had never laid with her, then who revealed it to %0a> David? He should have waited three months. And if You will say that David %0a> knew that Uriah had never laid with her, why did he send Uriah to his wife, %0a> saying: 'Go down to your house, and wash your feet?'" %0a> %0a> Usually the readers of the To rah give this example of "a love triangle %0a> evidence of King David's less than exalted qualities and of the inconsistent %0a> the Creator's judgment— how He forgave David for "killing" Uriah, and so forth. %0a> We must remember that the Torah speaks only of the spiritual worlds and their %0a> laws, which have no obvious consequences in our world. There is a cause-and- %0a> effect connection: whatever occurs in our world is a result of a Higher cause, but %0a> no way is it vice versa, i.e., whatever is described in the Upper World does not %0a> sarily need to manifest in ours. To consider the Torah a narrative abo %0a> relegates the Torah of the world of Atzilut, the Creator's holy na: %0a> the Creator's Light, to the lowest level of creation, which is strictly forbid %0a> "Do not make an idol for yourself." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> le" as %0a> icy of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ibout %0a> im e S , %0a> Iden: %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 292 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 135. He replied to him: "Of course, David did not know, but he waited more %0a> than three months, as four months had passed." As we have learned, on the %0a> 15 th day of Nissan, David ordered all the people of Israel to prepare for war, %0a> Yoav— on seventh day of Nissan. They conquered the lands of Moav and %0a> remained there for four months, until he went to Bat Sheva in the month %0a> of Elul. And on Yom Kippur, the Creator forgave him his sin. But there are %0a> those who say that David dispatched his orders on the seventh day of Adar, %0a> the troops assembled on the 15 th day of lyar, he went to Bat Sheva on the %0a> 15 th day of Elul, and on Yom Kippur the Creator forgave him and spared him %0a> from death at the hands of the angel Domeh. %0a> %0a> Domeh is in charge of adultery. And since David was forgiven on the Day of %0a> Atonement, he thereby escaped death at the hands of Domeh. However, death %0a> was a consequence of Uriah's death at the hands of Amon's sons, as is recorded %0a> in the book of Kings (Melachim, 1, 15:5), "For David did that which was right in %0a> the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded %0a> him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." %0a> %0a> 136. Domeh said: "Master of the World, I have nonetheless one claim %0a> against him: why did he open his mouth and say: 'The Lord is righteous, %0a> for a mortal does so,' thus condemning himself to death. Hence, I have the %0a> power to bring death upon him." The Creator replied to him: "You are %0a> not allowed to bring death upon him, for he has repented and confessed: 'I %0a> have sinned before the Creator,' even though he did not sin. But he did sin %0a> in one matter— the killing of Uriah. I have recorded his punishment, and %0a> he had received it." Then Domeh immediately gave up his complaints, and %0a> returned, despondent, to his place. %0a> %0a> The last letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH has two points— restriction %0a> (strictness) and mercy. And all the corrections of Malchut with the help of the %0a> covenant (circumcision) are intended to conceal strictness and reveal mercy. %0a> Then, the Creator's name descends into Malchut. Even though Malchut exists %0a> there under the ban of the first restriction (strictness and judgment), and all %0a> the impure forces cling onto her, this point is nonetheless concealed, and only %0a> Bina's property of mercy is revealed. Thus, the impure forces-desires, which are %0a> foreign to holiness and spirituality, are powerless and cannot cling to her. %0a> %0a> To violate the covenant means to reveal the strictness and judgment in %0a> Malchut (the letter Hey). As a result, the impure forces immediately cling to her, for %0a> this is their property— a part of them. The holy soul, the Creator's name, thereby %0a> disappears at once, as it is written (lyov, 4:9): "By the breath of God they perish." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 293 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> David himself is the part of Malchut related to Malchut's property of mercy. %0a> Hence, he requires special care so as to prevent Malchut's property of strictness %0a> from being revealed in him. For he who reveals the property of strictness and %0a> violates the covenant with the Creator, surrenders himself to the impure forces, %0a> which condemn him to death. This is because the property of strictness reveals %0a> itself within him before the impure force (the angel Domeh), who wished to %0a> cling to David's soul and drag it to hell. %0a> %0a> Although he was innocent, David begged the Creator's forgiveness for adultery, %0a> and received it. But with regard to David sending Uriah to his death, Domeh had %0a> no right to ask the Creator for punishment, as he is only in charge of adultery. %0a> %0a> 137. And David said to this: "Were it not for the Creator's help, Domeh had %0a> nearly claimed my soul." "Were it not for the Creator's help" means "had the %0a> Creator not been my guard and guide against the angel Domeh." "Nearly" %0a> means that only the distance as thin as a thread remained for Domeh to drag %0a> my soul to hell. %0a> %0a> David is Malchut, of whom it is written (Mishley, 5:5): "Her feet descend to %0a> death," for she is the end, conclusion of holiness (the spiritual). The impure %0a> forces originate in Malchut, and she sustains them, as it is said (Tehilim, 103:19): %0a> "His kingdom rules over all." %0a> %0a> However, when Malchut exists in her corrected property of mercy (item 122), %0a> she is defined as consisting of two points: her own point of judgment and the %0a> point of mercy that she received from Bina. Her point of judgment is concealed, %0a> while the point of mercy is revealed. And thanks to this correction, all that the %0a> impure forces can get from Malchut is a Ner Dakik (tiny luminescence), which %0a> only sustains their existence, but does not allow for their spreading. %0a> %0a> Ner Dakik, the source of existence for the impure forces, is also known as %0a> Hoteh Dakik, a small sin, the root of sins, as it is written (Talmud, Sukkah, 52:1): %0a> "Initially, the impure force seems as thin as a spider web, but then grows as %0a> thick as a shaft." And it is called small (Dakik), for judgment and restrictions are %0a> concealed within the property (point) of mercy. %0a> %0a> However, he who violates the covenant causes the point of judgment in %0a> Malchut to be revealed. As a result, the impure forces cling to Malchut and draw %0a> much Light from her, thus receiving the strength to spread and expand. And he %0a> who does so is said to be forsaking his own soul, as it is written: "By the breath %0a> of God they perish" (lyov, 4:9). %0a> %0a> And when he merits returning to the Creator, he returns and corrects %0a> Malchut with the property of mercy. This is why this process is called Teshuva %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 294 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (return), from the word of Tashuv (to return) + "A," where "A" (Hey) designates %0a> the Creator. In other words, it is the return to the property of mercy, whereas %0a> the property of judgment goes back to being concealed in the property of mercy, %0a> like a small candle, and nothing more. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written: WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, %0a> referring to His acceptance of my return and repelling the angel Domeh by %0a> bringing Malchut back to her place (to the property) of mercy, reducing the %0a> property of judgment to a mere small candle, a hair's-breadth fire, whose LIGHT %0a> SEPARATES ME FROM THE IMPURE FORCE. %0a> %0a> This is that minimal Light that must always remain between Malchut and %0a> the impure force, so as to allow Malchut to exist and be sustained by this small %0a> Light, called "small sin," so small that DOMEH WOULD NOT DRAG MY %0a> SOUL TO HELL FOR IT. %0a> %0a> It is precisely the magnitude of this Light that saved me from the hands %0a> of Domeh, for had the property of judgment not returned to Malchut in the %0a> measure of a small sin, I would have fallen into the hands of Domeh. %0a> %0a> 138. Therefore, man should be careful not to say what David said, for one %0a> cannot say to the angel Domeh that "It was an error" (Kohelet, 5:5), as it was %0a> with David, when the Creator won the dispute against Domeh. "Why should %0a> the Creator be angry over your word" (Kohelet, 5:5), i.e., for what you have %0a> said. "Destroyed the work of your hands" (Kohelet, 5:5) i.e., the sacred flesh, %0a> the holy covenant, which you have broken, and are therefore to be dragged to %0a> hell by the angel Domeh. %0a> %0a> There are two ways to return to the Creator ("Introduction to the Study of %0a> the Ten Sefirot," items 45, 59, 64; Talmud, Yoma, 86:2): %0a> %0a> 1) Repentance out of fear, when intentional sins become unintentional, %0a> %0a> 2) Repentance out of love, when intentional sins become merits. %0a> %0a> Before the end of correction, when the forces of strictness, restriction, and %0a> judgment are still needed in the world, as it is written (Kohelet, 3:14), "The %0a> Creator hath so made it that man should fear Him," Malchut must sustain the %0a> existence of the impure forces as Ner Dakik, so they will not disappear from %0a> the world. %0a> %0a> Therefore, at such a time (in this state), Malchut's corrections are made in %0a> two points: mercy and judgment. However, judgment is concealed, while mercy %0a> acts openly. This is why the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is feared: if %0a> man is worthy— it is good, if not— it is evil (items 120-124). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 295 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, DURING THE 6,000 YEARS, WE RETURN TO THE %0a> CREATOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR, which causes our intentional sins to turn %0a> into unintentional ones— errors. As a result of our repentance, we bring Malchut %0a> back to the property of mercy. But strictness and judgment are concealed in her %0a> to the extent of a small candle (small sin), since Malchut must still remain in the %0a> property of fear. Hence, this return is called "the return out of fear." %0a> %0a> The small sin that must remain is also called "unintentional sin," an "error," %0a> a "mistake," for it is not regarded as a sin in and of itself. Rather, it only leads %0a> man to commit an unintentional sin. Man sins intentionally only after having %0a> first committed an unintentional sin: he committed something unintentionally, %0a> but it turned out that he has sinned. %0a> %0a> Thus, this small sin remains in Malchut, but although it remains, it is not %0a> really considered a sin. Yet, through this concealed judgment and strictness %0a> we come to intentional sins. This is why it is said: "Initially, it is as a hair's- %0a> breadth," i.e., like a small sin. But then, unless we properly guard our covenant, %0a> it "becomes as thick as a shaft," as the property of strictness and judgment %0a> becomes revealed in Malchut. %0a> %0a> It is hence said that Domeh stands at the gates of hell, as the power of a %0a> small sin is only an entrance, for it is said that it looks as thin as a spider web. %0a> Therefore, our repentance is called "forgiven sins," which turn into unintentional %0a> errors, as though they were mistakes. For a small sin remains, which is capable %0a> of leading us to intentional sins. %0a> %0a> All this refers to the repentance out of fear, whereas the second kind is the %0a> repentance out of love, when intentional sins turn to merits (item 126). %0a> %0a> Therefore, MAN SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY WHAT DAVID %0a> SAID, i.e., not to utter the word that causes the property of judgment in Malchut %0a> to be revealed (as David had done). FOR ONE CANNOT SAY TO THE ANGEL %0a> DOMEH THAT IT WAS AN ERROR, for he is unsure as to whether he can %0a> return to the Creator right away, so that his sin would be forgiven and made %0a> unintentional, AS IT WAS WITH DAVID, WHEN THE CREATOR WON %0a> THE DISPUTE AGAINST DOMEH. %0a> %0a> It happened with David because throughout his life all of his actions before %0a> the Creator were pure, he had committed no crimes, and the only exception was %0a> his act toward Uriah. Hence, the Creator became his defender, and helped him %0a> return to Him at once, and his sin was turned into an error, as it is said in The %0a> Zohar (item 137): WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, DOMEH %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 296 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> HAD NEARLY CLAIMED MY SOUL. But other people should fear this angel, %0a> for an unintentional sin may lead them to hell at the hands of Domeh. %0a> %0a> DESTROYED THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS, THE SACRED FLESH, %0a> THE HOLY COVENANT, WHICH YOU HAVE VIOLATED, AND ARE %0a> THEREFORE TO BE DRAGGED TO HELL BY THE ANGEL DOMEH. %0a> The correction in us called "the holy covenant" is regarded as "the work of %0a> our hands," as it is written: "Confirm the work of our hands." The holy soul %0a> is called the sacred flesh, as it is said, "Out of my flesh shall I see the Creator" %0a> (lyov, 19:26) (item 131). Because of the revelation of the property of strictness %0a> and judgment in Malchut, the correction of the covenant was corrupted, and %0a> Domeh drags the soul to hell. %0a> %0a> Therefore, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS %0a> (item 130). In the end of correction, the Heavens will declare the work of His %0a> hands, as the reward for all these corrections will be revealed. It will become %0a> clear that this was THE WORK OF HIS HANDS, and NOT OURS', and THE %0a> HEAVENS DECLARE this. And the great Zivug RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL %0a> will be made on these actions (corrections) (item 92). DECLARE refers to the %0a> Light's descent from Above. %0a> %0a> Know that this is the only difference in our world before and after the end of %0a> correction. Before the end of correction, Malchut is called the Tree of Knowledge %0a> of Good and Evil, for Malchut is the revelation of the Creator's governance over %0a> this world. And until people achieve the state where they can receive His Light %0a> (as He conceived and prepared for everyone back at the Thought of Creation), %0a> the world will be ruled by good and evil, by reward and punishment. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that our Kelim de Kabbalah (vessels of reception) are %0a> impure, stained by egoism, which (i) prevents the Creator's Light from filling %0a> theses desires, and (ii) separates us from the Creator. And the infinite goodness %0a> that He has prepared for us may only be received in altruistic desires, for these %0a> delights are not limited by the bounds of creation, like egoistic pleasures, in %0a> which fulfillment instantly douses the pleasure. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written: "The Creator hath made everything for His own glory" %0a> (Mishley, 16:4), i.e., all the deeds in the world were initially created by Him %0a> so that we could please Him. Therefore, people in our world are engaged in %0a> things that are totally opposite from what they should be doing, according to the %0a> purpose of their creation. After all, the Creator clearly states that He created the %0a> world for Himself: "I have created it for My glory" (Yeshayahu, 43:7). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 297 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yet, we claim the exact opposite— that the whole world was created for us, %0a> and we desire to swallow it whole, for our own pleasure, satisfaction, indulgence, %0a> and exaltation. So it is no surprise we are unworthy of receiving the Creator's %0a> perfect goodness. And thus He rules over us through good and evil, in the %0a> form of reward and punishment, for one depends on the other: reward and %0a> punishment give rise to good and evil. %0a> %0a> Because we use our desires to receive (pleasure), thus becoming opposite %0a> m the Creator, we perceive His governance towards us as evil. This stems fn %0a> at man cannot perceive obvious evil from the Creator, as this w %0a> dermine the creatures' perception of the great and perfect Creator, fo %0a> one cannot create evil. %0a> %0a> Therefore, to the extent that man feels bad and evil, and denies the Divine %0a> Providence, a veil immediately falls over him, and the sensation of the Creator's %0a> existence disappears. This is the worst punishment in the world! %0a> %0a> Hence, the sensation of good and evil in the Creator's governance gives us %0a> a feeling of reward and punishment. This is because he who exerts efforts not to %0a> lose faith in the Creator's existence and governance, even if he tastes evil in His %0a> governance, is rewarded with finding strength to not lose faith in the governance %0a> and good purpose of the Creator's "evil" influence. But if he had not yet merited %0a> the opportunity to exert efforts in believing that the Creator pursues a definite %0a> purpose by sending him unpleasant sensations, he is punished with remoteness %0a> from faith in the Creator and the sensation of His existence. %0a> %0a> Therefore, although He has done, is doing, and will do all the deeds in the %0a> world, it remains semi-concealed from those who perceive both good and evil. %0a> For when they perceive evil, the impure force is allowed to conceal the Creator's %0a> governance and faith in Him. Thus, man suffers the worst punishment in the %0a> world— the sensation of detachment from the Creator— and becomes filled with %0a> doubts and denial of the Creator's existence and governance. And when he %0a> returns to the Creator, he receives a corresponding reward, and is able to unite %0a> with Him once again. %0a> %0a> But through this very governance of reward and punishment, the Creator %0a> has prepared for us the opportunity to utilize this governance in order to achieve %0a> the end of correction, when all people attain their corrected Kelim (desires), and %0a> use them to bring pleasure to the Creator, as it is written that He has created %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Then the great Zivug of Atik will be revealed, we will all return to the Creator %0a> out of love, all our intentional sins will turn to merits, all evil will be felt as %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 298 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> infinite goodness, and His Divine Providence will be revealed in the entire %0a> world. Thus, ALL SHALL SEE that only He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a> the deeds in the world, and that no one acts besides Him. After the sensation of %0a> evil and punishment is turned to one of goodness and reward, and our egoistic %0a> desires become altruistic, we are given the opportunity to attain the Maker, for %0a> we conform to the work of His hands by blessing and exalting Him above all evil %0a> and all punishments we had once suffered. %0a> %0a> However, the most important point to stress here is that until the end %0a> of correction, all the corrections were considered as THE WORK OF OUR %0a> HANDS. This is why we receive rewards or punishments for them. But in the %0a> great Zivug at the end of correction, it will be revealed that all the corrections %0a> and all the punishments are THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a> %0a> Thus, it is said, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a> This is because the great Zivug signifies what the Heavens will declare, that all %0a> the deeds are the work of His hands, that He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a> the deeds in the whole of creation. %0a> %0a> 139. Thus, "the Heavens declare the work of His hands." These are the friends %0a> who have united in the bride (Malchut) by studying the Torah on the night %0a> of the holiday of Shavuot. They are all participants of the covenant with her, %0a> and are called "the work of His hands." And she praises and notes each and %0a> every one of them. What is Heaven, firmament? It is the firmament, where %0a> the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiac are located. This firmament is %0a> called the Book of Remembrance, and it declares and records them, so they %0a> shall become the sons of His palace, and He will fulfill all their desires. %0a> %0a> Yesod of Zeir Anpin, onto which a Zivug is made for the revelation of all %0a> the Supernal Degrees, called the sun, the moon, the stars, and the signs of the %0a> zodiac, is referred to as the "firmament." All of the Supernal stars exist on the %0a> firmament, called Yesod of Zeir Anpin. And everything exists thanks to it, for it %0a> makes a Zivug with Nukva, called earth, and shines upon her with all these stars, %0a> i.e., gives these stars to her. %0a> %0a> It turns out that Malchut is smaller than the sun (ZA). But at the end of %0a> correction, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light %0a> of the sun will be seventy times greater than before— Malchut will become as %0a> big as Zeir Anpin during the six days of creation. When will this be? Rabbi %0a> Yehuda answers: on the day when death disappears forever, and the Creator %0a> and His Name are as one. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 299 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Heaven or the firmament (ZA) is HaVaYaH, called "the sun." Malchut %0a> (Nukva) receives from it, and is called "the moon." During the 6,000 years, %0a> Malchut receives the Light from the six days of creation, but Zeir Anpin does not %0a> reveal that the Creator and His Name are one. Hence, the moon is smaller than %0a> the sun. Its lesser size is a result of Malchut's consisting of both good and evil, %0a> reward and punishment. %0a> %0a> There is a considerable difference between "Him" and "His Name." "His %0a> Name" is Malchut, where all the Zivugim, and all the states of unification and %0a> separation are accumulated. But at the end of correction, when death is said to %0a> disappear forever, HaVaYaH and His Name will be one. The Name (Malchut) %0a> will be like the Light of Zeir Anpin— only goodness without evil, and the private %0a> governance will be revealed in her, which means that the light of the moon will %0a> become equal to that of the sun. %0a> %0a> Therefore at this time (in this state), Nukva will be called "the Book of %0a> Remembrance," for all human deeds are recorded in her. Yesod of Zeir Anpin is %0a> called "remembrance," for it remembers the deeds of the entire world, studies, %0a> and analyzes all the creatures that receive from it. %0a> %0a> During the 6,000 years before the end of correction, the Book of %0a> Remembrance exists sometimes together and sometimes separately. But at the %0a> end of correction, these two degrees will merge into one, and Malchut herself %0a> will be called "the Book of Remembrance," when ZA and Malchut become a %0a> single whole, for Malchut's Light will equal that of ZA. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the firmament is a place where the sun, the moon, the stars, %0a> and the signs of the zodiac are located. The firmament is Yesod of ZA, which %0a> emanates all the Light of the world and sustains all existence. It passes the Light %0a> onto Malchut when she is smaller than it, and the state, "He and His Name are %0a> one" has not yet been achieved. And at the end of correction, it will be exactly %0a> like Malchut, who is hence called the Book of Remembrance. %0a> %0a> Thus, when Malchut receives all the properties of Zeir Anpin (the firmament, %0a> called "Remembrance"), she will become the Book of Remembrance, i.e., she %0a> and the firmament will be one. %0a> %0a> 140. Day after day brings Omer— a sheaf. The holy day out of those days %0a> (Sefirot) of the King (Zeir Anpin) praises the friends, who study the Torah %0a> on the night of Shavuot. They say to each other, "Day after day shall bring %0a> a sheaf," and praise it. And the words "night after night" refer to all the %0a> degrees, Sefirot of Malchut, that reign in the night, praise one another by %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 300 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> each receiving from a friend, from another Sefira. And the state of complete %0a> perfection makes them beloved friends. %0a> %0a> Having explained that THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS %0a> HANDS is THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE. The Zohar continues to clarify the %0a> writings in the Book ofMalachi (3:14-16): "You have said, 'How futile it is to serve %0a> the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted %0a> before Him— what is the use of it all? And now we regard the wicked as blessed: %0a> they have settled in their wickedness, tried the Creator, and were liberated.' Then %0a> those who feared the Creator spoke WITH EACH OTHER, and the Creator %0a> hearkened and heard, and a BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE was recorded before %0a> Him for those who fear the Creator (every day) and honor His (holy) name. %0a> And they shall become chosen for Me,'— the Lord said,— 'on the day that I shall %0a> determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,— on %0a> the day that I shall work a miracle, on the day of the end of correction.'" %0a> %0a> Before the end of correction, before we prepare our desires "to receive" only %0a> for the Creator's sake, and not for self-gratification, Malchut is called "The Tree %0a> of Knowledge of Good and Evil," for Malchut governs the world in accordance %0a> with man's deeds. Inasmuch as we are not yet ready to receive all the delight that %0a> the Creator prepared for us in His Thought of Creation, we have no choice but %0a> to submit to Malchut's governance of good and evil. %0a> %0a> And this very governance prepares us for the eventual correction of our %0a> desires to receive (Kelim de Kabbalah) into desires for bestowal (Kelim de Hashpaa), %0a> thus achieving the goodness and delight that He conceived to bestow upon us. %0a> %0a> As was previously stated, the sensation of good and evil creates in us a %0a> feeling of reward and punishment. Therefore, when one tries to retain his faith %0a> in the Creator while he is feeling evil, but still continues to observe the Torah %0a> and Mitzvot as he did before, he is rewarded. %0a> %0a> And if he cannot overcome this test and is distanced from the Creator, he %0a> becomes filled with doubts with regard to the good governance. Alternatively, he %0a> stops believing that the Creator governs the world altogether, or feels resentment %0a> towards the Creator in response to these unpleasant sensations. The Creator pun- %0a> ishes for all thoughts, just as He does for all actions (Talmud, Kidushim, 40:1). %0a> %0a> It is also said that one's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his %0a> sin. But sometimes man's doubts are so overpowering that he regrets even the %0a> good deeds he had previously done, and says (Malachi, 3:14): "You have said, %0a> 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, %0a> and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all?'" He becomes %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 301 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> a complete sinner, who regrets his righteous past (complaining that he wasted %0a> time and effort instead of enjoying this world like the others!), and his doubts %0a> and regrets cause him to lose all of his good deeds, as the Torah warns us: %0a> "One's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his sin." %0a> %0a> Yet, even in this state, man can return to the Creator. However, he is said %0a> to be beginning on his path anew, as though he is a newborn, for all of his past %0a> good deeds are gone. %0a> %0a> One should not take the aforesaid literally, even in its spiritual context, for %0a> he who works to achieve unconditional altruistic deeds constantly experiences %0a> descents and ascents, is filled with doubts, and tries to overcome them. Only %0a> one who advances in this manner feels that he is starting his work every time %0a> anew, that he understands no more than a newborn baby. Conversely, one who %0a> belongs to the masses— who works in his egoistic desires— is constantly filled with %0a> self-reverence and thinks that on each new day, he adds to the previous one, and %0a> nothing seems to disappear. This makes his spiritual growth impossible. %0a> %0a> Only one who truly ascends the spiritual degrees feels like a newborn baby %0a> before his Creator at each moment. After all, as he ascends from one degree to %0a> the next, the previous state (degree) disappears, and until he attains a Higher %0a> Degree, he is in total darkness and feels that he is starting from scratch, rather %0a> than supplementing his assets, which is how the spiritually inanimate (Domem %0a> de Kedusha) feel. %0a> %0a> The governance of good and evil causes us to ascend and descend— each in %0a> his own way... Each ascent is considered a separate day (sensation of Light). As a %0a> result of the great descent that he has just undergone by regretting his past good %0a> deeds, man moves into a state of ascent, as one who is born anew. %0a> %0a> Therefore, at each ascent, it is as though one starts over on his path to the %0a> Creator. Thus, each ascent is regarded as a separate day, for there is a break (night) %0a> between these states. And each descent is hence considered a separate night. %0a> %0a> This is what The Zohar tells us: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A %0a> SHEAF— in each ascent we draw nearer to the Creator's greatest day (the end %0a> of correction), HE PRAISED THE FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD SPEAK %0a> WITH EACH OTHER. This is because through the great Zivug at the end of %0a> correction, they will all merit returning to the Creator out of love, for the desire %0a> "to receive" will be completely corrected, and they will begin to receive only for %0a> the Creator's sake, so as to bestow delight upon Him. %0a> %0a> In this great Zivug (unity), we will reveal all the supreme goodness and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> delight of the Thought of Creation. And we will tl %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> th %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 302 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> its would %0a> he direct %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lose punishments we experienced in the states of descent, which %0a> t and regret the efforts exerted in the Torah, all those punishments %0a> rrect and purify us. And now, at the end of correction, they are the %0a> se for our sensation and reception of the Creator's goodness. %0a> %0a> Had it not been for the terrible suffering and punishments, we would not %0a> have been able to achieve the state of being filled with perfect delight. Therefore, %0a> even these intentional sins turn into merits, as it is said: DAY AFTER DAY %0a> ULL BRING A SHEAF— each ascent in Malchut, up to the end of correction, %0a> %0a> This day is revealed by the word, which supports the Torah in all its greatness. %0a> What is this word? When they say, "How futile it is to serve the Creator! When %0a> we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what %0a> is the use of it all?" %0a> %0a> These words brought punishments that have now become merits, for all %0a> the perfection and magnificence of that great day can now be revealed thanks %0a> to these very punishments of the past. Thus, those who uttered these words are %0a> now regarded as those who fear the Creator and praise His Name. (And these %0a> words could only have been spoken by those who made efforts to advance on %0a> the Path of Truth, and felt frustrated upon receiving uncorrected egoism of a %0a> Higher Degree. In other words, frustration comes only to those who truly work %0a> for the Creator's sake.) %0a> %0a> Hence, it is said about them: "The Lord said, 'On the day that I shall %0a> determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,'" %0a> for all the nights— states of descent, suffering and punishments, which sever %0a> their connection with the Creator— now become merits and good deeds. And %0a> the night turns into day, darkness turns into Light, and there are no divisions %0a> between days, and all 6,000 years gather into one great day. %0a> %0a> And all the Zivugim that were made one after another, revealed the ascents %0a> and the separate, consecutive degrees, have now gathered into one degree of %0a> one great Zivug— Unity, which shines in the world from end to end. Hence, it %0a> is written: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A SHEAF, that is, the intervals %0a> between days now become magnificent glory, for they have been turned into %0a> merits. Thus, everything becomes the Creator's one glorious day! %0a> %0a> And the words "night after night" refer to all the degrees that reign in the %0a> night. They praise one another, and each receives everything that man feels as %0a> suffering in a state of descent— this is called night. And through such sensations, %0a> intervals are formed between the sensations of day. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 303 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> , now %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the whole, each degree is separated from one another. Night %0a> to attain the Creator. And while each night is full of darkness, %0a> all the nights (states of feeling emptiness, hopelessness, heaviness of efforts, the %0a> Creator's concealment) gather together and form a unified vessel of reception %0a> of Supernal wisdom, which fills the entire earth with Knowledge of the Creator, %0a> and the nights shine like days. %0a> %0a> For each night receives its own part of Knowledge only by joining with the %0a> ther nights. Thus, each night is said to help the other nights in the Knowledge, %0a> differently, man is ready to receive the Knowledge only if he joins with th %0a> nights. %0a> %0a> And since night is a feeling of lacking knowledge, attainment, and sensation %0a> )f the Creator by uniting, they form a perfect vessel of reception of the Knowledge %0a> of the Creator. And they praise one another, for each has received his share of %0a> the Knowledge of the Creator thanks exclusively to his friend, through uniting %0a> 1. Only in unity do they merit reception of the Supernal Knowledge, %0a> aid that through the perfection achieved by all, the nights becam%3c %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 141. Does he speak of the others in the world who do not obey the Creator, %0a> and whom He does not wish to hear? But they made lines through all the %0a> earth, that is, these things make a line out of those that reside Above and out %0a> of those that reside below. From the first— firmaments are made, and from the %0a> second, from their return— earth. And should you say that they revolve around %0a> the earth in one place, it is said that they are also at the end of the world. %0a> %0a> Thus far, we have discussed the most terrible punishments and suffering in %0a> the world— being detached from the Creator and losing faith in Him. Moreover, %0a> The Zohar tells us that all the punishments, all the suffering of hell and of the %0a> body, which stem from personal sins and fill this world, also gather and are %0a> included into one great Zivug, as it is written: "And it shall come to pass, that as %0a> the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will %0a> rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you" (Devarim, 28:63). %0a> %0a> All will gather and become one great Light, and everything will turn to %0a> great joy and bliss. It is therefore said that THERE IS NO SHEAF AND NO %0a> THINGS IN THE OTHER WORDS OF THE WORLD, which man perceives %0a> in this world as suffering. But they will turn to joy and bliss, and thus the holy %0a> King, too, shall wish to hear them. %0a> %0a> So, all the suffering during the 6,000 years will gather at the end of correction %0a> and will become a tremendous delight, as the prophet said: "In those days and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 304 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> in that time, said the Lord, even if the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, there %0a> shall be none" (Yirmiyahu, 50:20). %0a> %0a> Everything will turn to merits, so much so that they will ask and search "for %0a> the past sins that can be included in the Zivug, and which can be laughed at, %0a> for they were felt as suffering and now they are joy and bliss," but they will not %0a> find any. There will be no more suffering in its true form, as it was in the past, %0a> although they greatly desire to find it and feel it, for all suffering will have now %0a> been turned to great Light. %0a> %0a> This Supernal Degree, created by the great Zivug out of all the souls and all %0a> the deeds, both good and evil, is now defined as a pillar of Light, which shines %0a> from one end of the world to the other. And this unity is perfect, as is said by %0a> the prophet (Zachariah, 14:9): "And the Creator shall be one (for all), and His %0a> Name one"— all the senses will grasp the Creator's complete and perfect name, %0a> "the Infinitely good." %0a> %0a> Precisely because this most Supernal Degree is achieved as a result of %0a> bringing together all the suffering and punishments, it fills the entire universe %0a> with Light, including earth. However, it should be noted that the suffering of %0a> which The Zohar speaks is not the suffering of the body's lack of pleasure. It is %0a> the suffering caused by the absence of unity with the Creator! %0a> %0a> But if suffering is so useful, why is it written, "neither them nor the %0a> reward for them?" Suffering is necessary, for it is correction. However, the %0a> true suffering, for which man can receive the degree of the end of correction, %0a> is caused by temporary distancing from the Torah and Mitzvot as a result of %0a> feeling the pain of suffering, and this pains the Creator. Thus, the Shechina %0a> suffers, for when man suffers in his heart, he speaks ill of her, willingly or %0a> unwillingly. Although the Torah tells him to be patient, to endure and have %0a> faith above reason— selfless faith that all of this is the correction that he must %0a> undergo— he debases the Shechina by being unwilling to endure them and %0a> achieve the end of correction. %0a> %0a> Man's soul is also a Partzuf consisting of ten Sefirot. In its initial, spiritually %0a> undeveloped, unborn state, the soul is defined as a point, as a potential future %0a> spiritual body. If man works on himself, this point within him gradually acquires %0a> a screen, and he makes a Zivug on it. He repels all the pleasures for the sake of %0a> the Creator's desires, and receives Light in this point. Thus, he "amplifies" it to %0a> the size of a Partzuf and transforms it into a body, a newborn Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Afterwards he continues to cultivate his screen, gradually nurturing the %0a> small state into the big one, until he receives all of the Light destined for him %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 305 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> by the Creator within his spiritual body. This state is called "the end of the %0a> personal correction." When all the personal corrections merge into one, the %0a> general correction of the entire world (of Malchut) will occur. Malchut is a Partzuf %0a> that consists of separate souls; each soul, the Partzuf of each soul, is part of %0a> Malchut, and Malchut is a collection, the sum of all the Partzufim that are to be %0a> made by all the people. To make a Partzuf is to acquire a screen and become %0a> filled with Light. %0a> %0a> THOSE THAT RESIDE ABOVE AND THOSE THAT RESIDE BELOW %0a> refers to the order of time in the spiritual, eternal world, which is different from %0a> ours. When the Creator wished to create the world, He immediately created %0a> everything: all the souls filled with Light in a state of absolute perfection, called %0a> "the end of correction," where all the creatures receive the infinite delight that %0a> He envisioned. %0a> %0a> This ultimate state was born with the Creator's first thought to create the %0a> world, and it exists in its final form from the very first moment, for the future, %0a> present, and past are merged in the Creator, and the factor of time does not %0a> exist in Him. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 1. Change of time: the stretching of time into infinity, i.e., when time %0a> stops and the present merges with the past and the future; when %0a> time reverses its course or disappears. Yet, time is the only thing that %0a> provides us with a perception of existence. By "switching off time, we %0a> stop perceiving that we exist! %0a> %0a> 2. Transformation of space: expanding and contracting of space into %0a> point; space taking other forms, other dimensions; infinity and tota %0a> absence of space altogether. %0a> %0a> I've already dealt with these issues in my book, Kabbalah, Science and the %0a> Meaning of Life, and I would prefer not to digress from the text of The Zohar. %0a> However, to understand our true state, and not the one we currently perceive, it %0a> is essential to remember that notions of time and space do not exist with regard to %0a> Creator. In reality, we are completely different and exist in a completely different %0a> form and state from what we presently perceive. We feel this way because our %0a> sensations are distorted by our egoism, which infuse our senses and possess our %0a> bodies, like a cloud. %0a> %0a> Therefore, all that is described in the Torah refers strictly to the spiritual %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 306 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> and future, for time exists only with regard to those who are still confir %0a> their egoistic Kelim (desires). From this we can understand what is said %0a> Torah: "The Creator showed Adam each generation and its representatives, %0a> showed it to Moshe as well" (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 38:2). %0a> %0a> Yet, if the above described unfolded before the creation of these generations, %0a> how can the Creator show them to Adam and Moshe? It is possible because all %0a> the souls with all their destinies from the moment of their creation to the end of %0a> their correction emerged before the Creator in their completeness and reside in %0a> the Supernal Garden of Eden. From there they descend and enter the bodies %0a> our world, each at their own "time." And there, "Above," the Creator re %0a> them to Adam, Moshe, and all the others who were worthy of it. Howeve %0a> is a difficult notion, and not every mind is ready to grasp it. %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar says (Terumah, 163) that the way the six Sefirot of Zeir %0a> Anpin unite as ONE above Chazeh, de Zeir Anpin, where they are free from the %0a> Klipot, Malchut unites with Zeir Anpin below his Chazeh, so that unity exists %0a> below, as it does Above. For the Creator (Zeir Anpin) is One (male) Above. And %0a> Malchut becomes One (female), so that One (male) would be with One (female). %0a> This is the secret of unity expressed in the words: "He and His Name are one"; %0a> "He" (ZA) and "His Name" (Malchut) are within one another. %0a> %0a> The degree that is born at the end of correction, in the state of "He and %0a> His Name are one," already exists Above as the sum of all the 600,000 souls and %0a> deeds during the 6,000 degrees (called "years") in the world, which will emerge %0a> before the end of correction, but exist in their eternal form Above, where the %0a> future is as present. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the pillar of Light that will shine upon the world from one end %0a> to the other at the end of correction already exists in the Supernal Garden %0a> of Eden, which illuminates it with the same brilliance that will be revealed to %0a> us in the future. This is because at the end of correction the two degrees will %0a> shine as one, and "He and His Name will be one." A pillar (line) of Light will %0a> appear, made of those that reside Above (the souls that reside in the Supernal %0a> Garden of Eden) and those that reside below (the souls clothed in the bodies %0a> of our world). And "One receives One"; these two degrees shine together, and %0a> reveal the Creator's unity thereby, as it is said that on that day "He and His %0a> Name will be one." %0a> %0a> From the aforesaid one can assume that the pillar of Light that shines in %0a> the Supernal Garden of Eden descends and shines in the Garden of Eden of %0a> our world. But this is not so. Rather, FROM THE FIRST-FIRMAMENTS %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 307 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ARE MADE, for this degree exits onto a Zivug of Yesod of Zeir Anpin, called %0a> "firmament." Therefore, all the Zivugim that ascend above the firmament shine %0a> upon those that receive them from the firmament and below. The degree above %0a> the firmament is referred to as "Heaven," and the degree that receives from the %0a> firmament is called "earth." %0a> %0a> When the line (pillar) of Light unites the inhabitants of Above and those %0a> of below, the distinction between the Supernal Garden of Eden and the %0a> inhabitants of this world still remains. This is because the inhabitants of the %0a> Supernal Garden of Eden receive from a Zivug above the firmament, and what %0a> they receive is called "the new Heaven for the inhabitants of Above." And only %0a> a small luminescence, called "the new earth," descends below the firmament to %0a> the inhabitants of below. This is what The Zohar says: "From the first— firmaments %0a> are made, and from the second, from their return— earth." %0a> %0a> Although in this great Zivug, as in all Zivugim, all that is decided above the %0a> firmament, above the Zivug, spreads down to earth, below the line of the Zivug, %0a> one should not think that this Zivug (like all the previous ones) is merely a thin %0a> line of Light, called "one," a limited, inner place, as it is written at the beginning %0a> of creation: "Let the waters gather together unto one place," i.e., in the inner %0a> place of the worlds (and not the outer), a place of Israel. %0a> %0a> But the Light of this Zivug revolves around the world and fills it whole. This %0a> Light reaches even the outer parts of the worlds (the nations of the world), as %0a> the prophet writes: "The earth shall be filled with Knowledge of the Creator" %0a> (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a> %0a> 142. And since out of them Heavens were created, who resides there? He %0a> returned and said, "There is a shelter for the sun in them. This is the holy %0a> sun, called Zeir Anpin, and it dwells and resides there, and adorns itself %0a> with them." %0a> %0a> 143. Since Zeir Anpin resides in those firmaments and clothes in them, he %0a> emerges like a bridegroom out of his wedding canopy, and rejoices and races %0a> along these firmaments, and exits them and enters, and races toward a tower %0a> in a different place. He emerges from one end of Heaven, from the Upper %0a> World, from the Highest place, from Bina. And his season— where is it? It is %0a> the opposite place below, i.e., Malchut, which is the year's season that forms %0a> all the ends and binds everything— from Heaven to this firmament. %0a> %0a> The Zohar speaks of the great secret of the sun coming out of its hiding. It is %0a> worth noting that Kabbalists often use the word "secret" only to explain and as %0a> if reveal the mystery in the passages that follow. The reader should nevertheless %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 308 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> i that there are no secrets in the world. Man attains everything frc %0a> in our world, in the process of his mental development, %0a> attains new notions on every new degree. And whatever he considered %0a> only yesterday now becomes clear and revealed before him. %0a> %0a> The same is true with regard to spiritual attainments. Kabbalah is called a %0a> secret wisdom, for it is concealed from ordinary people, it is a secret to them. But %0a> as soon as one acquires a screen and begins to perceive the spiritual world, he %0a> sees the secret becomes a reality. And this process continues until he completely %0a> attains the entire universe, all of the Creator's secrets ("Introduction to the %0a> Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 148). %0a> %0a> The sun emerges from its hiding (sheath— Nartik), from under the Huppah, %0a> and rushes to a tower at a different place— after the great Zivug under the Huppah. %0a> Zeir Anpin leaves his hiding and enters Malchut, called the tower of Oz (strength) %0a> of the Creator's Name, for Malchut then ascends and unites with ZA, and they %0a> become as one. %0a> %0a> The end of Malchut is called "the year's season." And until the end of %0a> correction, the impure forces, called "the end of days," attach themselves to %0a> it. Now, after the end of correction, it is still necessary to correct this part of %0a> Malchut, called "the end of days." To this end, the sun emerges from its hiding, %0a> LIKE THE BRIDEGROOM EMERGING FROM UNDER THE HUPPAH, %0a> and shines, and enters the tower of Oz (Malchut), races and shines on all the %0a> ends of Malchut to correct "the year's season" of the lower end of Heaven. %0a> %0a> For this last action corrects all the ends of Malchut and unites all from the %0a> Heavens to the firmament. In other words, Malchut receives the Light of THE %0a> END OF HEAVENS above the firmament (ZA). %0a> %0a> 144. There is nothing hidden on account of the year's season and the phase %0a> of the sun that revolves in all directions. And there is no concealment, i.e., %0a> not a single Supernal Degree is hidden from him, for all were bound together %0a> and everyone appeared before him, and none could be concealed from him. %0a> Thanks to him and thanks to them he returned to them, to the friends, in the %0a> phase of complete return and correction. All this year and all this time is for %0a> the Torah (to study it), as it is written: "The Creator's Torah is perfect." %0a> %0a> After the great Zivug, a restriction was imposed on all the Upper Light %0a> (item 94). Therefore, a new Zivug (TOWER) is necessary, which reveals anew %0a> all of the Upper Light that was concealed on account of the disappearance of %0a> the degree of BON, before it begins to ascend to SAG. Thus, NOTHING IS %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 309 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> CONCEALED FROM THAT PHASE OF THE SUN THAT REVOLVES IN %0a> ALL DIRECTIONS. %0a> %0a> Indeed, a Zivug between the phase of the sun and the year's season corrects %0a> the ends of Malchut on all sides, until the correction is completed. Thus, BON %0a> ascends and becomes like SAG, which amounts to the complete correction %0a> of BON, whereupon THERE IS NO CONCEALMENT, NOT A SINGLE %0a> SUPERNAL DEGREE IS CONCEALED FROM HIM, for all the degrees and %0a> the Upper Light are once more revealed in their perfection. AND NOTHING %0a> CAN BE CONCEALED FROM Him, for all the degrees and Light gradually %0a> return to Him, until all become revealed. %0a> %0a> It is hence said that the revelation does not occur at once, for while in %0a> its phase, the sun travels and shines in sufficient measure for a COMPLETE %0a> RETURN, as it is written that He punishes the sinners and cures the righteous, %0a> whereupon they all merit the complete revelation of the Star. %0a> %0a> 145. The word HdVaYaH is written six times, and there are six verses from %0a> "the Heavens declare" and until "The Creator's Torah is perfect" (Tehilim, %0a> 19:2-8). And this is the secret of the word BERESHEET, which consists of %0a> six letters: THE CREATOR CREATED ET (THE) HEAVENS AND THE %0a> EARTH, six words in all. The other sources of the verse from "The Creator's %0a> Torah is perfect" and until "they are better than gold" (Tehilim, 19:2-8) %0a> correspond to the six utterances of the name HaVaYaH in them. The sources %0a> from "the Heavens declare" through "The Creator's Torah is perfect" are for %0a> the six letters in the word BERESHEET, whereas the six names are for the %0a> six words from "the Creator created" through "the Heavens and the earth." %0a> %0a> It is known that any degree born or revealed in the worlds is first revealed %0a> through its letters, which signifies the, as yet, unattainable. Afterwards, it %0a> appears in the combination of letters. This degree then becomes attainable, %0a> its contents become known, as previously described with the letters RYU = 216 %0a> andAB = 72 (item 116). %0a> %0a> The six letters in the word BERESHEET contain everything that exists in %0a> Heaven and on earth, but in an unattainable form, and are hence designated by %0a> these letters alone, without their combinations. Then there are the six words: %0a> Bara Elokim Et Ha-Shamayim Ve-Et Ha-Aretz (THE CREATOR CREATED THE %0a> HEAVENS AND THE EARTH), where everything that the word BERESHEET %0a> contains (Heaven, earth, and all their inhabitants) is already attained. %0a> %0a> The same principle allows us to understand what is included in the six %0a> verses from "the Heavens declare" to "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This is %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 310 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> just the beginning of the revelation of attaining the end of creation in the form %0a> of letters, as with the six letters in the word BERESHEET. %0a> %0a> And the complete revelation, the attainment of the end of creation begins %0a> with the verse "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This verse contains six names, %0a> each of which constitutes unique attainment, thus indicating that only after the %0a> completion of this degree do all the letter combinations become revealed and %0a> attained in the great Zivug at the end of correction, as it is said, NOTHING IS %0a> CONCEALED IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM. %0a> %0a> This is why The Zohar says that THE WORD BERESHEET, WHICH %0a> CONSISTS OF six, IS WRITTEN (SPEAKS) ABOUT THIS SECRET. The %0a> word BERESHEET contains six letters, where Heaven and earth are concealed, %0a> before they become revealed in the six words, THE CREATOR CREATED %0a> THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. %0a> %0a> The same applies to the six verses (Tehilim, 19:2-8): the great Zivug of the %0a> end of correction is not yet revealed from THE HEAVENS DECLARE to THE %0a> CREATOR'S TORAH IS PERFECT. Only after NOTHING IS CONCEALED %0a> IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM are the six names revealed, which in turn reveal %0a> the end of correction in its full perfection. %0a> %0a> 146. As they were sitting and talking, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, %0a> entered. He said to them: "Certainly, the face of the Shechina has come, hence %0a> I called you Pniel (Pnei-face + El-Creator = the Creator's face)" (item 119), %0a> for you have seen the Shechina face to face. And now that you have attained %0a> Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, it certainly refers to Atik, the Sefira of Keter, just %0a> as everything else that occurred afterwards, as it is written in the Torah: "And %0a> he slew the Egyptian." And he who is concealed from all— is Atik. %0a> %0a> It is said in the continuation of "The Donkey Driver," who revealed the soul %0a> of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba, as a result of which %0a> Rabbi Shimon called them Pniel. For the soul of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada is a %0a> spiritual degree destined to be revealed in the future, at the end of correction. %0a> This is why they were in a state of concealment of the Upper Light (item 113), %0a> as was already mentioned with regard to the Zivug of the sun's phase and the %0a> year's season, until they have found Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakunya and others, %0a> thus meriting all the Light once again. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Rabbi Shimon says to them, YOU HAVE ATTAINED, %0a> BENAYAHU BEN-YEHOYADA WAS REVEALED TO YOU. This means %0a> that they have already attained the six verses, the essence of THE HEAVENS %0a> DECLARE, and exist in the six names. When they have attained the soul of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 311 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada with the help of the donkey driver, their attainment %0a> had not yet been revealed to them, as they still existed in the six verses— the %0a> reason for their concealment. But now they have attained and revealed his soul, %0a> that it is the great Zivug of Atik, when everything is revealed to all. %0a> %0a> 147. The words, "He slew the Egyptian" are explained in another place, i.e., %0a> at a different degree, in a different way. He opened and said, "He slew the %0a> Egyptian, a man of good stature, five cubits high." All of this refers to the %0a> same secret. This Egyptian is the one who is well-known and is described as %0a> "very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the Jew," for he is great and %0a> honored, as that old man had already explained (item 99). %0a> %0a> The Torah describes the killing of the Egyptian in the book Shemot (2:12). %0a> As we have already learned from the article about Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, it is %0a> expressed differently at a different degree (in a different language, the language %0a> of Divrey HaYamim). However, these two verses are the same secret, for it is %0a> written in the book Shmuel 1 (11:23): "And he slew the Egyptian, a prominent %0a> man," while in Divrey HaYamim it is written: "And he slew the Egyptian, a man %0a> of good stature, five cubits high." Both verses are the same secret, which The %0a> Zohar continues to clarify. %0a> %0a> 148. This case was examined at the Divine Assembly. "A prominent man" %0a> and "a man of good stature" are the same, as they constitute Shabbat and %0a> the bounds of Shabbat. As it is written: "You shall measure it from outside %0a> the city." It is also written, "You shall not impede limitations in measure." %0a> Hence, he was a man of good stature. Precisely such, from one end of the %0a> world to the other. Such is he, Adam, the first man. And should you disagree, %0a> referring to the written "five cubits," know that these five cubits extend from %0a> one end of the world to the other. %0a> %0a> The matter concerns the Divine Assembly, of which Rabbi Shimon said: "I %0a> saw those ascending, but how few they were" (Talmud, Sukkah, 45:2). There is a %0a> lower assembly of the angel Matat. However, the described above takes place in %0a> the Supernal Assembly, which will be clarified further. %0a> %0a> "A prominent man" is the degree of Moshe, of whom it is written in the %0a> Torah: "And there hath not since risen a prophet in Israel such as Moshe" %0a> (Devarim, 34: 10), of whom it is written "My servant Moshe is not so; he is trusted %0a> in all My house; with him do I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not with %0a> riddles" (Bamidbar, 12:7-8). %0a> %0a> "A prominent man" also constitutes a measure, which extends from one end %0a> of the world to the other. Moreover, its form and size correspond to Shabbat and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 312 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the bounds of Shabbat, where the bounds of Shabbat are the end of its measure. %0a> During the 6,000 years, the bounds of Shabbat are limited by only 2,000 Amah %0a> (cubits). However, after the end of correction, the bounds of Shabbat will extend %0a> from one end of the world to the other, as it is written: "And the Lord shall be %0a> King over all the earth" (Zachariah, 14:9). %0a> %0a> As we already know, the Light can descend and fill the Partzufim down to the %0a> level of Parsa of the world of Atzilut. Shabbat is a spiritual state when the worlds %0a> of BYA with all that inhabit them rise above the Parsa to the world of Atzilut. %0a> Above Parsa are only pure forces, corrected desires (Kelim). Hence, naturally %0a> there is no need to separate pure Kelim from impure ones and to correct them %0a> during Shabbat. %0a> %0a> However, the Light of Shabbat shines not only in the world of Atzilut, but %0a> beyond its bounds as well. It thus affects the sixteen Sefirot from Parsa down to %0a> Cha^eh of the world of Yetzira so the soul can be in the state of "Shabbat" with %0a> these desires, too. The language of our world describes this as the permission %0a> to transcend the bounds of the city of Atzilut (seventy Amah) by 2,000 Amah %0a> down to the Chazeh of the world of Beria, and then another 2,000 Amah from %0a> Chazeh of the world of Beria to Chazeh of the world of Yetzira. (Seventy Amah are %0a> regarded as being within the city limits.) %0a> %0a> However, after all the Kelim (desires) are corrected, there will be no %0a> restrictions; the world of Atzilut will extend down to our world, and only the %0a> state of Shabbat will prevail in the entire world— in all desires of all creatures. %0a> %0a> It is hence written: A PROMINENT MAN and A MAN OF GOOD %0a> STATURE are one and the same, for they constitute Shabbat and the bounds %0a> of Shabbat, as is said: AND YOU SHALL MEASURE FROM OUTSIDE THE %0a> CITY, and it is also written: YOU SHALL NOT IMPEDE JUDGMENT IN %0a> MEASURE. It follows that an object's measure represents its limit, just as %0a> the words A MAN OF GOOD STATURE alludes to the end, the bounds of %0a> Shabbat after the end of correction, which will extend from one end of the %0a> world to the other. %0a> %0a> AND HE SHALL BE PRECISELY MAN OF GOOD STATURE indicates %0a> that size does not rule over him; rather, he rules over size, and it is he who %0a> determines this size according to his own will. SUCH IS HE, ADAM, who, %0a> prior to his sin, extended and shone from one end of the world to the other %0a> (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1), as the bounds of Shabbat after the end of correction. %0a> %0a> FIVE CUBITS FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER- %0a> because the five cubits are the five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Night of the Bride %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 313 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> that expand and fill everything from one end of the world to the other after the %0a> end of correction. %0a> %0a> 149. It is, as is written, "like a weaver's beam" (Shmuel 1, 17: 7) "as the %0a> Divine staff" (Shemot, 4:20) that was in his hand, which reveals by the %0a> secret name (Light) confirmed in it by the Light of the letter combinations %0a> that Betzalel and his disciples engraved, called "weaving," as is written, %0a> "He filled them and others, and BOUND them." And that staff— within it %0a> shone a secret name, inscribed on all its sides by the Light of the sages, who %0a> confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties. And the rest of what %0a> is written from here onward is similar to what the old man had already %0a> explained. Happy is his lot! %0a> %0a> The secret of the letter combinations in sacred names is called "weaving," %0a> like a weaver joins his threads into a fabric, the letters join into combinations of %0a> sacred names, which designate man's spiritual level of their attainment. Hence, %0a> The Zohar says that the Creator's staff in Moshe's hand had engraved the letter %0a> combinations of the secret name, which Betzalel and his disciples engraved as %0a> they worked on the Tabernacle. %0a> %0a> The Creator's staff is therefore called a "weaver's beam." The Hebrew word %0a> for "beam" is MANOR (from OHR— Light). This refers to the Light of the letter %0a> combinations in the secret name, which Betzalel weaved and engraved, as it is %0a> said, "by the Light of the letter combinations that Betzalel engraved." %0a> %0a> However, the staff does not shine in all directions until the end of correction, %0a> for there is a distinction between the Creator's staff and that of Moshe. It is %0a> written of the staff of Moshe: "Put forth your hand and take it by the tail (of a %0a> snake), and it shall become a staff in your hand" (Shemot, 4:4). This means that %0a> it did not shine from all sides. %0a> %0a> However, after the end of correction, it will shine in all directions, as it is %0a> said: "And the secret name shone from within that staff in all directions by the %0a> Light of sages, who confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties." For the %0a> secret name that was engraved on the staff shone in all directions, i.e., in the %0a> property called "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). It will thus %0a> begin to shine evenly in all directions, whereas the Light of the name engraved %0a> on the staff is the Light of Hochma of the Name MB. %0a> %0a> 150. Be seated, dear friends. Be seated and let us renew the correction of the %0a> Bride on this night, for whomever joins her on this night shall be guarded %0a> Above and below in the coming year. And this year shall pass over him in %0a> peace. Such people are described in the verse: "The angel of the Lord stands %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 314 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> round those that fear Him, and delivers them. O taste and see that the Creator %0a> is good" (Tehilim, 34:8-9). %0a> %0a> As was already stated in item 125, there are two explanations of the aforesaid. %0a> The first is that since the day of the giving of the Torah is the Light of the end %0a> of correction that abolishes death forever and brings freedom from the angel of %0a> death, one should exert to receive this Light on the day of Shavuot (Pentecost), as %0a> Light is renewed on the holiday and brings deliverance from death. %0a> %0a> According to the second explanation, Malchut is called a "year," and the %0a> renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah after the end of correction %0a> will also bring the complete and final correction of the year (Malchut). This is %0a> because the renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah is referred to as %0a> the correction of the night of the bride, Malchut, called a "year." And this brings %0a> us to a corrected year. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 151. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "In the beginning the Creator created %0a> the Heavens and the earth." This verse should be examined carefully, for %0a> whoever claims that there is another Creator disappears from the world, as it is %0a> written, "He who claims that there is another Creator perishes from both the %0a> earth and from Heavens, for there is no other Creator, but the Almighty." %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar continues to discuss the correction of the bride. It starts %0a> with the first sentence of the Torah: IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a> CREATED, with the root and the source of all the corrections of the bride %0a> (Malchut) during the 6,000 years. %0a> %0a> Malchut's entire correction occurs only through her union with Bina and %0a> the reception of Bina's properties. In the verse, IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a> CREATOR CREATED, the Creator is called Elokim, signifying Bina. This means %0a> that He created the world by the property of Bina for the purpose of correction. %0a> %0a> Elokim consists of MI-Bina and ELEH-Malchut. Thanks to the constant %0a> union of MI and ELEH, the world can exist. The Creator is Bina, called Elokim, %0a> and as a result of Ohr Hochma clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the union of MI and %0a> ELEH provides ELEH with the property of Bina. It is through this correction %0a> that the world is able to exist. %0a> %0a> The union of MI and ELEH does not permit for the existence of other, %0a> foreign, egoistic forces within the Partzuf. These are the so-called "other gods," %0a> who cannot sustain the world, as they separate MI from ELEH and do not clothe %0a> the Light of pleasure (Hochma) in the altruistic intention of Hassadim (for the %0a> Creator's sake), which leads to Ohr Hochma departing the Partzuf, leaving ELEH. %0a> Therefore, it is forbidden to believe that man is governed by any other forces %0a> besides the Creator, for instead of existence and reception of the Light of Life, %0a> such belief brings the world and man only ruin and disappearance of this Light. %0a> %0a> 315 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 316 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 152. With the exception of ELEH, everything is written in Aramaic. This is %0a> called "translation." He asks: However, should you suggest that it is because %0a> the holy angels do not understand the translation, i.e., the Aramaic language, %0a> then everything should have been said in Hebrew, so the holy angels would %0a> hear and be grateful for it. He replies: This is exactly why it is written in the %0a> translation (in Aramaic), as the holy angels neither hear nor understand it, %0a> and hence will not envy people, which would be detrimental to the latter. For %0a> in this case, even the holy angels are called Creators, and they are included in %0a> the group of Creators, but they have not created Heaven and earth. %0a> %0a> Aramaic is referred to as "translation." It is very close to the holy language of %0a> Hebrew, but angels neither need nor know it nonetheless. Yet, they know and need %0a> all the other languages of the nations of the world. This is so because the transla- %0a> tion from the holy language is called its "reverse side," its VAK without GAR. %0a> %0a> In other words, there is an altruistic language, which is hence called "holy," %0a> and its reverse, preliminary stage, hence called "translation," is the Aramaic %0a> language. No other language in the world but Aramaic can act as translation %0a> from the holy language. All the other languages in the nations of the world %0a> (egoistic desires) are strictly egoistic and are unrelated to altruism. They are not %0a> AHP with regard to GE (the holy language). %0a> %0a> Therefore, the translation is truly close to the holy language. However, %0a> there is one distinction here, which renders it unnecessary to angels: the holy %0a> language is like the scale pointer that shows the extent of balance between %0a> the right and left scales, where the pointer moves between the two scales and %0a> delivers its judgment— toward the scale of reward (for merits) or towards the scale %0a> of punishment (for sins). It brings everything back to the state of correction, to %0a> purity and holiness, and is hence called the holy language ("Introduction to The %0a> Study of Ten Sefirot," item 120). %0a> %0a> As it is written in item sixteen, Heaven, earth, and all that inhabit them %0a> were created by MA, i.e., Malchut, as it is written, "MA = WHAT = HOW %0a> glorious is Your name in all the earth, which You have set above the Heavens!" %0a> Indeed, Heaven was created by the name (property) of MA (Malchut), whereas %0a> the Heaven that is mentioned alludes to Bina, called ML But all is explained by %0a> the name Elokim. %0a> %0a> The name Elokim is revealed in Heaven and earth, which were created by the %0a> power of MA, by attaching the letters ELEH from Ima-Bina with the help of MAN %0a> and good deeds of the lower ones. Therefore, the Light of GAR, i.e., Ohr Hochma, %0a> called Elokim, is consistent neither in Heaven (Bina) nor on earth (ZON). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 317 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Typically, only GE are present above the Parsa, in ZON of the world of %0a> Atzilut, whereas their AHP is below the Parsa, in the worlds BYA, for ZON %0a> themselves are unwilling to receive Ohr Hochma unless it is to be passed on to %0a> the Partzufim— the souls of the righteous— in the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> When the lower ones, the righteous that exist spiritually in the worlds of BYA, %0a> raise MAN from below upwards, from their place in BYA to Malchut de Atzilut, %0a> MA turns into MI and the letters ELEH join with MI. Together, they create the %0a> word Elokim, which is the Light of Heaven and earth. However, if the lower ones %0a> corrupt their deeds by sinking into egoistic intentions, the Light disappears and %0a> leaves Sefirot K-H with the Light Ruach-Nefesh (called MI or MA), while the letters %0a> ELEH fall into the impure forces, for MI is GE and ELEH is AHP. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the entire correction depends exclusively on attaching the letters %0a> ELEH to MI with the help of MAN. Hence, this correction is called the "holy %0a> language," like the scale pointer, which determines the balance between egoistic %0a> desires and altruistic intentions, i.e., the reception for the Creator's sake. This is %0a> why the scale pointer is set in the middle, and by means of such interaction of %0a> the properties of Malchut (the will to receive) and Bina (the will to bestow), one %0a> can achieve the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> The Light is called "holy," as it passes the holy name Elokim to ZON, descends %0a> from Bina to ZON, and transfers the letters ELEH to the pure and holy side, to %0a> the scale of merit. This is why the Hebrew word for "scales" is Mawznaim (from %0a> the word Awzen), for the Light in AHP {Awzen-Hotem-Peh) is named according to %0a> its highest Light, the Light of Awzen of the Sefira Bina or Ohr Neshama. %0a> %0a> Keter - Galgalta - Forehead/Skull - Yechida %0a> Hochma - Eynaim - eyes - Haya %0a> %0a> Parsa %0a> %0a> Bina - Awzen - ear - Neshama %0a> %0a> ZA - Hotem - nose - Ruach \ AHP %0a> %0a> Malchut - Peh - mouth - Nefesh ) %0a> %0a> And the language of translation called Targum is opposite to the holy %0a> language of Mawznaim (scales). It is so because when the lower ones do not raise %0a> MAN and do not harbor pure intentions, it is defined as an aspiration to use %0a> only the desires to receive, designated by the letters ELEH, and which do not %0a> aspire to unite with the desire (property) of bestowal (the letters MI-Bina). As a %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 318 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> result, AHP of ZON, called MA, descend and Heaven and earth (ZON) return %0a> to the state of VAK. %0a> %0a> Such a state is called the language of Targum. The Gematria of the word %0a> Tardema (sleep) matches that of the word Targum. In Hebrew, the word Targum is %0a> spelled with the same letters as the words Tered MA, which means "descending %0a> MA," for through this spiritually impure language, AHP = MA (designated %0a> by the words Tered MA) becomes revealed. This leads to the descent from the %0a> scale of merit to the scale of punishment. While this is happening, the state %0a> of GE is called "sleep." %0a> %0a> However, all this refers only to ZON, to Heaven and earth created in MA, %0a> the desires of reception. This is because they have emerged as a result of a Zivug %0a> on Yesod, called MA. But the holy angels that emerged from the Zivug de Neshikin %0a> (kissing Zivug) of AVI, and which have only MI but no MA (only altruistic desires %0a> of bestowal, the property of IMA-Bina), permanently exist in the state of VAK %0a> without GAR, that is, without Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> On the other hand, their VAK is Ohr Hassadim of MI = Ima-Bina. Ohr %0a> Hassadim in Bina is as important as GAR, for it fills desires with just as perfect %0a> a sensation as does the GAR, to the point that they reject Ohr Hochma, just like %0a> Ima. And there is holiness in them; hence, GAR are called holy, as well. %0a> %0a> There are two reasons why angels do not respond to the language of Targum, %0a> which adds MA to ZON and returns ZON to the state of VAK: %0a> %0a> 1. Even when ZON are in the state of GAR due to the influence of the %0a> holy language, angels do not receive GAR (Hochma) from it, as, just %0a> like Ima, they want only Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> 2. The addition of the Achoraim (AHP) does not apply to angels whatsoever; %0a> %0a> they lack the properties of MA. Hence, The Zohar says that THE HOLY %0a> ANGELS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for translation AND %0a> DO NOT LISTEN to it. They do not need it because they neither %0a> lose anything when it is present nor gain anything when it is absent, %0a> as they constitute the property of VAK and lack the property of MA. %0a> %0a> AND THEY SHALL NOT ENVY MAN-this sentence refers primarily to %0a> the damnation of other gods, the forces that prevent man from revealing GAR, %0a> Ohr Hochma. As a result, he loses the Light and the letters ELEH, for angels do %0a> not have the properties of GAR de Hochma either, but only GAR de Hassadim. %0a> Thus, they feel ashamed of their descent to such a low degree, and envy us for %0a> considering ourselves significant. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 319 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar says that in this case, even the holy angels are called "Creators," %0a> but they have not created Heaven and earth and are called "Creators-Elokim" %0a> (forces) because they come from Ima-Bina (called Elokim), thus existing in the %0a> general Elokim. But THEY HAVE NOT CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH, %0a> for they cannot uphold the existence of Heaven and earth in GAR de Hochma. %0a> However, Heaven and earth (the correction of the world to its ultimate merging %0a> with the Creator) cannot exist unless man settles there (man must consist of %0a> egoistic and altruistic desires) and sows and reaps (corrects his egoistic desires by %0a> uniting with the properties of Bind). This existence is possible only in the Light %0a> of GAR de Hochma (the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake). Hence, %0a> angels do not create Heaven and earth. %0a> %0a> 153. He asks: earth is called Arka, when it should read, Ar'a. He answers: %0a> because Arka is one of the seven lands below, where the sons of Cain's sons %0a> reside. Indeed, after being banished from the face of the earth, they descended %0a> there and fathered generations; wisdom became so lost that all understanding %0a> was lost, and this is a double land, consisting of darkness and Light. %0a> %0a> Each of the seven Sefirot (the six Sefirot of ZA and Malchut) contain the %0a> properties of the other six. Thus, each one of them contains the seven Sefirot %0a> HGT NHYM. In other words, Malchut, too, has seven Sefirot, and the lower %0a> world contains seven lands, as well, called Eretz, Adama, Arka, Gia, Neshia, %0a> Tzia and level. %0a> %0a> Our land is called Tevel and is the highest of the seven lands. Arka is the %0a> third of the seven lands. The souls of Cain and Abel descend from the word %0a> Elokim, but due to the impurity that Chava (Eve), Adam's wife, received from %0a> the serpent, the soul of Cain emerged first from the letters ELEH, followed %0a> by the soul of Abel, which emerged from the letters ML These two Partzufim %0a> were meant to unite and incorporate their properties in one another, which %0a> would make the name Elokim shine in both of them, as when MI is permanently %0a> present in ELEH. However, the impure force that emerged together with Cain's %0a> soul incited him against his brother (MI of the word Elokim) to the point that he %0a> rose against Abel (MI in Elokim) and slew him. This is because the disappearance %0a> of the property of MI-Bina from ELEH is tantamount to murder. %0a> %0a> Without the support of the properties of MI, ELEH (Cain's own property) %0a> fell into the impure forces: from the spiritual level of the holy land to the impure %0a> place (of egoistic desires). And he lost his descendants (Partzufim filled with Light) %0a> because of the rule of the impure forces (the disappearance of the screen). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 320 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Thus, the holy language within him was substituted for translation, for he %0a> had lost the wisdom (Ohr Hochma). After all, the impure forces lack wisdom, as %0a> they have only the Light of HB without Daat. %0a> %0a> The slaying of Abel, i.e., the exit of Light from this Partzuf (item 152), occurs %0a> because MI is formed in ZON exclusively by the power of MAN (raised by the pure %0a> thoughts of the righteous in the worlds of BYA). Then appear the letters ELEH, %0a> and the word Elokim becomes as complete in ZON as it is in AVI. Malchut ends just %0a> like ZA, like Ima, due to the replacing of the letter Hey with Yod (item 17). %0a> %0a> However, the letter He;y does not disappear from MA forever. Rather, it %0a> simply enters the inner part of Malchut and hides there (the will to receive %0a> receives its fulfillment from altruistic actions, from Ohr Hassadim. Hence, its %0a> egoistic aspirations are temporarily unfelt, as they are concealed in Ohr Hassadim). %0a> Meanwhile, the letter Yod is revealed in ML %0a> %0a> This is why the Creator's holy name Elokim is also found in ZON, in Heaven %0a> and earth. However, Cain raised MAN not in holiness and purity, but wished %0a> to use the letters ELEH— which relate to him— for his own pleasure. This is %0a> described as, AND CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST ABEL, HIS BROTHER, for he %0a> put himself above his brother, to rule over MI (Abel). %0a> %0a> However, AHP of Nukva (the hitherto concealed letter Hey of MA) were %0a> immediately revealed, and the word MI disappeared from Malchut. Hence, %0a> Abel's soul, which stems from MI of NuLua (MI fill the Partzuf with Light and are %0a> considered its soul) ascends and disappears as well, as is described by the words, %0a> AND SLEW HIM, for the Light's exit from the Partzuf is referred to as death. %0a> %0a> This is why The Zohar describes this process in the following way: The %0a> serpent's impure force was within Cain (Beresheet, 2:4); hence, he wished to %0a> strengthen the letters ELEH, annul MI, and govern them. That is why he revealed %0a> AHP of Nukva (MA) and MI disappeared from Nukva, whereupon Abel's soul, %0a> which descends from MI, disappeared as well (AND SLEW HIM). %0a> %0a> Thus, Cain himself (ELEH) fell under the rule of the impure forces, called %0a> Arka or Eretz Nod, as it is written in the Torah: "And he settled in the land of %0a> Nod" (Beresheet, 4:16). %0a> %0a> The Zohar calls it a double land, one that contains both Light and darkness. %0a> This is because Light and darkness mix and act (rule) together, as there are two %0a> rulers in that land, who divide the power equally between them. One rules over %0a> darkness, the other over Light. Hence, in this state one is unable to separate %0a> Light from darkness, and only help from Above, the descending Light of reason, %0a> enables one to tell between the true Ruler and the lord of darkness. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 321 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 154. And there are two rulers there— one rules over darkness and one over %0a> Light, and they become hostile to each other. When Cain descended there, %0a> they joined together and became complete. And they all saw that they were %0a> Cain's descendants. Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, except %0a> for when the ruler of Light defeats the other, the ruler of darkness. Hence, %0a> they enter Light and darkness, and become as one. %0a> %0a> We need to review item 14, which expounds on the creation of the holy %0a> name Elokim. First, the letters ELEH ascend and join MI to form a simple %0a> word, since Ohr Hassadim is still insufficient, whereas holiness (Ohr Hochma) %0a> cannot enter the Kli (desire) without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it %0a> is concealed in the name Elokim. %0a> %0a> That is why a Zivug takes place in MI— to receive Ohr Hassadim, which clothes %0a> Ohr Hochma, thereby correcting the name Elokim: Ml BARAH ELEH— BARAH %0a> is the source of Ohr Hassadim, which clothes Ohr Hochma, thus connecting MI %0a> to ELEH, which brings correction to the name Elokim. MI-Bina consists of GAR %0a> (AVI with the property of pure altruism), who never receive Ohr Hochma, and %0a> ZAT (YESHSUT), who do receive Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> Therefore, as the letters ELEH begin to ascend to MI, they first rise to ZAT %0a> de Ml (YESHSUT), who receive Ohr Hochma, but are currently concealed in the %0a> name Elokim. Then transpires the second Zivug on GAR de Ml, AVI, altruistic %0a> desires, which provide ELEH with Ohr Hassadim, thus bringing correction to %0a> the name Elokim. %0a> %0a> AVI - GARdeBina - Ohr Hassadim %0a> %0a> YESHSUT - ZATdeBina - Ohr Hochma %0a> ZON %0a> %0a> Since ELEH lacks Ohr Hassadim, those deprived from Ohr Hochma are called %0a> Partzuf Cain. Not only did Cain fail to raise MAN to receive MI with Hassadim, %0a> he also wished to receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, thereby destroying the Partzuf %0a> named Abel, for the egoistic desires of AHP de Malchut of Atzilut were exposed. %0a> The Light disappeared from Partzuf Abel, signifying its death, whereas Cain %0a> himself fell into the impure forces— ELEH. %0a> %0a> The place of these impure forces is called Arka. Also, two rulers exist there, %0a> emerging from the impure ELEH: when AHP de MA in Malchut is concealed, %0a> while AHP de Ml are revealed, they can pass the Light from the perfect, %0a> pure, and holy name Elokim to the souls. Ohr Hochma of ELEH (received by %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 322 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT) then clothes in Hassadim (received from AVI), and the holy name %0a> Elokim becomes revealed. %0a> %0a> However, since the impure forces cling only to the AHP of the pure forces %0a> (to MA), the letters ELEH within them exist in two incomplete states: (i) when %0a> no Hassadim are present at all; (ii) when Ohr Hochma in ELEH cannot clothe in %0a> Hassadim due to the lack of Hassadim de Ml; hence, ELEH are kept in darkness. %0a> %0a> This is the male part of the impure ELEH, as these Kelim are intended for %0a> Ohr Hochma. However, they have no Hochma due to the lack of Hassadim de ML %0a> Hence, they are kept in darkness, devoid of both Hochma and Hassadim. Yet, %0a> these are great Kelim, for if they had been able to receive Ohr Hassadim, they %0a> would have been able to receive Ohr Hochma within it, too. %0a> %0a> The female part of the impure ELEH stems from AHP de MA of the holy %0a> Nukva, the Kli for Ohr Hassadim. However, the impure Nukva is considerably %0a> injured, as she is the basis for everyone's remoteness from the Creator, as she %0a> impersonates the holy Malchut. Depending on the extent of her corruption, %0a> she has a multitude of impure names. Yet, she still retains a tiny Light (Ner %0a> Dakik), since her Kelim stem from AHP de MA, the roots of which are Kelim %0a> of Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> These male and female parts of the impure ELEH are ZA and Malchut of %0a> the impure forces, the two rulers in Arka. The male part rules over darkness %0a> and the female part rules over the Light that is there. They complain against %0a> each another, since they are opposite. The male part complains because it is the %0a> Kelim of the letters ELEH, which are empty of Ohr Hochma; it hates the forces %0a> of remoteness from the Creator and forgery, existing within the Kelim of the %0a> female part of the impure forces, and prefers to remain in its darkness. %0a> %0a> Nukva of the impure forces, however, who has a small Light of Hassadim, %0a> does not aspire for Ohr Hochma, let alone for the darkness in which her male %0a> part abides. Therefore, she complains about the male part and distances from %0a> it. As The Zohar says, two rulers govern there: one (the male part) over darkness, %0a> and the other (the female part) over Light, and they are hostile towards each %0a> other, for the male part rules over darkness and the female rules over Light. %0a> Hence, they hate, slander, and complain against each other. And since they are %0a> thereby distanced from one another, they cannot expand their dominance and %0a> are incapable of causing any harm. %0a> %0a> However, after Cain had sinned and dropped the pure letters of ELEH of %0a> his soul into the impure forces of Arka, his ELEH, which are concealed from %0a> Hassadim, clothed in the tiny Light present in the impure forces. This revives %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 323 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the small Kelim de Hochma in Cain's ELEH, for the Light of the impure forces %0a> bestows life upon them, just like the pure Light of Hassadim. %0a> %0a> As a result, the male part of ELEH of the impure forces, too, made a Zivug %0a> with this Nukva, who clothed Cain's ELEH, since he has these Kelim, as well. %0a> With the help of this Zivug, Cain fathered his descendants, the sparks of Ohr %0a> Hochma that remain in the letters ELEH, which are not mixed with the male %0a> impure Kelim of ELEH that clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> This is why The Zohar says that when Cain descended there, everything %0a> merged and became complete, for the sparks of Ohr Hochma that remained %0a> in Cain's ELEH were clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a> Consequently, her male impure force wished to enjoy the sparks of Ohr Hochma %0a> that are in Cain's ELEH. %0a> %0a> Hence, they made a Zivug, i.e., spread and completed one another, and %0a> everyone saw that they were the descendants of Cain, that this Zivug produced %0a> the descendants, the clothing of the sparks of Ohr Hochma in Cain's impure %0a> ELEH. Thus, the sparks of Ohr Hochma of Cain's soul were revealed, and %0a> everyone saw that they were Cain's descendants, born of a vile Zivug. %0a> %0a> Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, for they were born from %0a> a union of the male and female parts of the impure ELEH, which are initially %0a> opposite to one another. Therefore, Cain's descendants have two heads, from %0a> the two impure forces: one craves the darkness of the desires to receive Ohr %0a> Hochma, and the other craves the Light within the impure desires of the impure %0a> Nukva. And the two serpent heads correspond to the two animals that belong to %0a> the system of the pure forces: the bull and the eagle. %0a> %0a> However, the two heads exist only when the male part is dominant, when %0a> darkness rules. Indeed, by clothing in the Light of ~Nukva in order to enjoy the %0a> small sparks of Ohr Hochma, the male part also supports (against its will) the %0a> dominance of its Nukva, for it wants her Light. As a result, their descendants %0a> have two heads: the first pulls in one direction and the second in another. %0a> %0a> Nukva of the impure forces does not need their male part whatsoever, as %0a> her male part exists in darkness and cannot give her anything. Therefore, Nukva %0a> dominates and prevails in her impurity, leaving nothing of the properties of the %0a> male part. Consequently, Cain's two-headed descendants become one-headed. %0a> %0a> The Zohar tells us that the ruler of Light defeats the lord of darkness. When %0a> the impure Nukva, which has the Light, dominates, she defeats the male impure %0a> part, as well as the other male ruler. She defeats the male part, fully subduing it %0a> to her rule, and they include themselves in her Light and darkness, and become %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 324 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> as one. Consequently, the rule of the male part (darkness) is included under the %0a> rule of the female part (Light), and the two heads become one. %0a> %0a> 155. For these are the two rulers, called Afrira and Kastimon, who resemble %0a> holy angels with six wings. One has the image of a bull, and the other of an %0a> eagle. And when they unite, they create an image of man. %0a> %0a> The male impure force is called Kastimon (from the word Kosti, devastation), %0a> for it is darkness and is unfit for man's life. And the impure Nukva, the female %0a> part, is called Afrira (from the word Afar, dust), and is unfit for sowing. She is %0a> called so in order to show that although she contains Light, she is insufficient %0a> for sowing the seed and producing harvest to feed human beings. %0a> %0a> The Zohar also says that she resembles holy angels with six wings, for the six %0a> wings of the holy angels correspond to the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH. In %0a> contrast, there are only four wings in the impure forces, corresponding to the %0a> name ADM, indicating the height of the impure forces with regard to the holy %0a> angels, opposite them. %0a> %0a> The Upper Light is called "wine," bringing joy to the Creator and to human %0a> beings. However, wine residue contains Sigim or wine yeast. And from this waste %0a> emerges the foremost wrecker of the world, for he is still connected to purity %0a> (to yeast) and has the image of a man. However, as he descends to bring people %0a> harm, he assumes the image of a bull. This is why a bull is the first of the four %0a> main types of wrecker. %0a> %0a> Hence, The Zohar tells us that Kastimon is a wrecker in the image of a bull, %0a> thus indicating that it is the basis of all wreckers that are called "the impure bull." %0a> It is the Sigim of the Supernal Ohr Hochma of the holy name Elokim, the impure %0a> ELEH that correspond to the pure ELEH of the name Elokim. For Sigim and %0a> yeast stand below it, but since it is still connected to purity, it has the image of %0a> man, for Ohr Hochma of the name Elokim is T^elem (image and likeness) of man, %0a> of which it is said: "Be T^elem Elokim— created man in image and likeness." %0a> %0a> Yet, when separated from purity (altruism) through deterioration of its %0a> desires and, consequently, of its properties, it descends to its place (befitting %0a> these properties) in Arka, and assumes the image (properties) of a bull. And its %0a> Nukva assumes (in Arka) the form (properties) of an eagle, in congruence with %0a> her goal and action of Linshor (to fall out)— to bring about the fall of human %0a> souls under her power. %0a> %0a> Hence, the word Nesher (vulture) is derived from the word Neshira (fall), just %0a> as leaves fall from a tree, for the role of the impure Nukva is to seek people out %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 325 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> and bring them to a state of night and darkness, to the destruction of the holy %0a> covenant, as a result of which people's souls depart from them (item 131). %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar tells us: "And when they unite, they form the image of %0a> man," i.e., if they return and unite with purity, existing as wine yeast, they return %0a> and assume once more the image of man, just as before they descended to Arka %0a> and became wreckers. %0a> %0a> 156. When they are covered with darkness, they turn into a serpent with two %0a> heads, and move like a serpent. They soar in the void and bathe in the Great %0a> Sea, and when they approach the chains of Aza and Azael, they rile and rouse %0a> them and leap into the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator %0a> wishes to bring justice upon them. %0a> %0a> I suggest that the reader will try to comment on The Zohar on his own, %0a> without any help, and then compare his thoughts with those stated below. This %0a> way, we might understand what Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag has done for us with his %0a> commentary. Prior to the appearance of his commentaries on the books of the %0a> ARI and The Zohar, there was no way for us to understand Kabbalah correctly, %0a> only a handful of people in each generation could climb the spiritua %0a> ler on their own. %0a> %0a> Now, however, I assure the reader that simply by constantly reading eve %0a> ks, which retell the compositions of the great Kabbalists, Rabbi Ashlag %0a> his elder son and my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Ashlag, anyone can attain ascension %0a> to the Creator. I think that those who have already read previous books realize %0a> that this is truly possible! %0a> %0a> As The Zohar already mentioned in item 154, when the impure Nukva %0a> dominates man through her Light, the two heads become as one. However, in %0a> the darkness, when the male part, called Kastimon, dominates, they turn into %0a> a serpent with two heads, for the male part is unable to annul the power of the %0a> female part, as it needs to be clothed in her Light. Hence, the serpent has two %0a> heads. And they move like a serpent— aiming to bring harm (the property of the %0a> serpent), to tempt Chava to dine on the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. %0a> %0a> By the power of the Rosh of the impure Nukva they soar in the void, which %0a> contains the root of the impure force, called "void" or the greatest fall, as it %0a> is written: "They ascended up to Heaven, they descended down to the abyss" %0a> (Tehilim, 107:26). By the power of the impure male part, they bathe in the Great %0a> Sea, in Ohr Hochma of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 326 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, Arka is called the Land of Nod, as it constantly sways from the %0a> rule of the two heads: those that reside there keep alternating between ascending %0a> up to the Great Sea and descending down into the void. %0a> %0a> The angels Aza and Azael are very exalted angels. Indeed, even after they %0a> had fallen from Heaven into our world, into the mountains of darkness, linked %0a> by a metal chain, so great was their power that with their help Bil'am (Balaam) %0a> attained the degree of prophecy, of which it is written: "Sees the Creator's %0a> presence" (Bamidbar, 24:4). %0a> %0a> This is described as "falls and opens his eyes," for Aza is referred to as %0a> "falling" because of his fall from Heaven to earth. And Azael is called "he who %0a> opens his eyes" with regard to Aza, at whose face the Creator throws darkness. %0a> And with regard to Bil'am's prophetic degree, our sages have said the following: %0a> "There has not been a prophet in Israel like Moshe, not in Israel, but there was %0a> one among the nations of the world, and his name was Bil'am" (Bamidbar-Raba, %0a> 14)— so great was his prophetic degree. %0a> %0a> And the reason for their downfall from Heaven to earth lies in their %0a> complaints against man at the moment of his making. Yet, there were many %0a> angels complaining and objecting, so why did the Creator cast down only these %0a> two? The answer to this question can be found in items 416-425 of the chapter %0a> "Balak" in The Zohar. Briefly, it says that when the desire to create Adam (or %0a> man, since the Hebrew word for man is Adam) appeared in the Creator, He %0a> summoned the Supernal angels, seated them before Him, and told them of His %0a> desire to create man. %0a> %0a> The angels replied: "What is man, that You are mindful of him?" (Tehilim, %0a> 8:5), meaning what are the properties of this man that You so wish to create? He %0a> replied to them: "This man will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass %0a> yours, for the human soul includes all the angels and Supernal Degrees, just as %0a> his body includes all the creatures of this world." %0a> %0a> Therefore, at the moment of creation of man's soul, the Creator summoned %0a> all the Supernal angels, so they would pass all of their properties and forces %0a> to man's soul. It is therefore written: "Let us make man in our image, in our %0a> likeness," meaning that man's "image and likeness" includes all of the properties %0a> of all the angels. %0a> %0a> The words "image and likeness" are written in quotation marks, since the %0a> words Tzelem and Demut (image and likeness) are not mere words that simply %0a> describe likeness. Rather, they constitute very meaningful spiritual notions. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 327 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> But the angels' question should be interpreted as follows: "What kind of a %0a> creature is this man and what is his nature? How shall we benefit from passing %0a> (including) our properties in him?" The Creator replied to this: "This man %0a> will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass yours." In other words, the %0a> Creator thus promised them that man will embrace all of their qualities (the %0a> properties of Tzelem), and that he will be wiser than them. However, because of %0a> their connection to him, they will also benefit from his great attainments and %0a> acquire everything that they presently lack. %0a> %0a> This is because the human soul includes all the spiritual degrees and all the %0a> utmost properties of all the angels. And just as his body includes all the materials %0a> and creatures of our world with all of their properties, so was the Creator's wish %0a> that his soul would absorb the whole of creation within it. %0a> %0a> It is written in the Torah: "Yaakov and Israel shall be told of the Creator's %0a> works (Bamidbar, 23:23)." The sages have said that in the future the angels will %0a> ask Israel for things that they do not know themselves, for Israel's attainments %0a> will be beyond that of the angels. Hence, all the angels took part in the creation %0a> of man and integrated all their properties within him. %0a> %0a> However, once man was created and sinned, thus becoming guilty before the %0a> Creator, the angels Aza and Azael appeared before the Creator with accusations %0a> "that man, whom You have created, has sinned before You." For these words, %0a> the Creator cast them down from their exalted and holy degree, and thus, they %0a> began to deceive human beings. %0a> %0a> Of all the angels, only these two, Aza and Azael, came before the Creator %0a> to complain about Adam's sins, for only they knew that man shall return to %0a> the Creator. However, Aza and Azael also knew that the harm brought to them %0a> by man's sin will not be corrected by this return. Moreover, they would prefer %0a> man to not return in his desires to the Creator at all. This is why they were the %0a> only ones that complained about Adam's sin, because from their perspective, %0a> this sin is incorrigible. %0a> %0a> The thing is that the breaking of the vessels and Adam's sin constitute the %0a> same breaking, disappearance of the screen (anti-egoistic willpower or intention %0a> to act for the Creator's sake). The difference is that the breaking of the vessels %0a> signifies the breaking of the screen in the Partzuf called "world," while Adam's %0a> sin is the breaking, disappearance of the screen in the Partzuf called "soul." %0a> The difference between these two Partzufim is that the Partzuf called "world" is %0a> external with regard to the inner Partzuf called "soul." The soul exists within the %0a> world and is sustained by it. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 328 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The breaking has its causes and consequences. It is necessary for mixing %0a> all the properties of Bina and Malchut, and must transpire both in the spiritual %0a> world and within the soul, to impart the properties of Bina to Malchut, and thus %0a> enable her to correct herself. %0a> %0a> The breaking of the world of Nekudim led to the breaking of the eight %0a> Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-2/3 of Tifferet and 1/3 of Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, %0a> four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M in each one that in turn consists of ten Sefirot, in all: %0a> 8 x 4 x 10 = 320 (SHACH) parts. As a result of the mixing of all the parts, %0a> each part in turn consists of 320 parts. All of these 320 parts, called Nitzotzin %0a> (sparks), acquired the egoistic will to enjoy by receiving the Creator's Light, %0a> which signifies their descent into the impure forces. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> /ision the reception of lower properties as a descent, the reception of %0a> spiritual properties as an ascent, the attainment of equivalence of forr %0a> union, and the emergence of a new property as separation. The appearance %0a> of egoistic desires in a spiritual object is considered a descent into the impure %0a> forces, although these forces exist within us (and not vice versa), and simply %0a> )me more apparent. There is nothing surrounding us, for everything %0a> the worlds and desires, both pure and impure. %0a> %0a> By studying Kabbalah we attract the emanation of the Light that surr %0a> il (see "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155), %0a> ;s within us a desire for correction. Then, as we attain the degrees o %0a> spiritual worlds, we begin to feel the spiritual Light that corresponds to each %0a> degree, through which we begin to discern egoistic and altruistic parts in each %0a> of our properties. %0a> %0a> By comparisons to the Light, we perceive our egoistic parts as evil, and to %0a> the extent that we sense it, we distance ourselves from it and refuse to use these %0a> desires. Conversely, we perceive our altruistic desires as good for us, but, having %0a> strength to use them, we submit a request, receive the necessary strength, ar %0a> ie Light for the Creator's sake, thereby ascending to a higher deg %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The return (Teshuva— repentance) means that by raising MAN (request for %0a> correction), we elevate some of the 320 corrupt parts from the impure forces, %0a> into which they fell, back to the world of Atzilut, where they existed prior to %0a> Adam's sin. However, we are powerless to sort out and correct, i.e., to elevate the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 329 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> thirty-two parts of Malchut herself, which exist in the eight Sefirot of this Partzuf %0a> (world), for their level of corruption is beyond our ability to repair them. %0a> %0a> Therefore, out of the 320 (SHACH = Shin + Chet = 300 + 20) parts, we can, %0a> that is, we are entitled to and must sort out and correct only 320 - 32 = 288 %0a> parts (RAPACH = 288) by our return to the Creator, i.e., 9 x 32, where nine %0a> designates the first nine Sefirot in each Sefira that we are allowed to correct. %0a> Yet, we are unable to correct Malchut of each Sefira, for this requires a Light %0a> of a special power. We will receive this Light from the Creator only after the %0a> correction of all the other 288 parts, that is, at the end of correction. %0a> %0a> These thirty-two parts of Malchut, which are impossible and thus prohibited %0a> to correct, are called Lev HaEven (Lamed-Bet Even— thirty-two stones). As I've %0a> repeatedly mentioned, there is no such notion as "prohibition" in Kabbalah; %0a> this word is used when it is necessary to point out the futility of trying despite %0a> one's weakness and limitation. "Prohibited" means impossible, beyond one's %0a> power. Moreover, it is not the Creator's prohibition; rather, as a result of one's %0a> personal faith and experience, one should admit that "prohibited" alludes to %0a> whatever is still beyond one's power to correct. %0a> %0a> Therefore, GAR de AVI are concealed, and their Light does not shine. %0a> After all, for all of its ten Sefirot to shine, a Zivug needs to be made on Malchut %0a> herself, for Lev HaEven, the thirty-two uncorrected parts of Malchut herself are a %0a> supplement to their ten Sefirot. And as long as these Kelim are missing, a complete %0a> Zivug is impossible. However, when the complete analysis and correction of the %0a> 288 (RAPACH = Reish + Peh + Chet = 200 + 80 + 8 = 288) Nitzotzin is completed, %0a> Lev HaEven will be corrected by itself, and no effort or corrections shall be %0a> required on our part. %0a> %0a> So the prophet says: "A new heart also shall I give you, and a new spirit shall %0a> I put within you; and I shall take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and %0a> I shall give you a heart of flesh" (Yechezkel, 36:26). Then AVI will receive their %0a> Light. However, this will occur at the end of correction, and before the end of %0a> correction, AHP of AVI will not be able to receive correction by means of our %0a> return, for we will be able to correct all of our egoistic desires, except for our very %0a> essence, Malchut de Malchut. %0a> %0a> These angels— Aza and Azael— are the real AHP de AVI that were destroyed %0a> during the breaking of the vessels, and were nearly restored before the sin of %0a> Adam. However, Adam's sin destroyed them once more, this time until the very %0a> end of correction. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 330 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, both angels were complaining to the Creator about their Light, %0a> which has disappeared because of Adam, for they saw that there was no hope %0a> that Adam would correct them through his return to the Creator. Moreover, %0a> they saw that by his return, Adam had lowered their degree even more, for now %0a> the entire correction and return was limited to only 288 parts, without any %0a> participation or even mentioning of the thirty-two forbidden parts, Lev HaEven, %0a> which refer to the correction of AVI, whose Light is the Light of these angels, %0a> just as the Kelim of the true AHP de AVI are their Kelim. %0a> %0a> Each raising of MAN designates cutting off, separation of impurity— Lev %0a> HaEven— from the food, RAPACH = 288 Nitzotzin, the parts that can be corrected. %0a> It follows that by preventing Aza and Azael from participating in the correction %0a> of Lev HaEven, we lower them even more. This is why the two angels complained %0a> to the Creator and tried to impede Adam from returning. After all, his return %0a> lowers them even further, for the thirty-two parts refer to them. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when the Creator saw that their complaints threatened to weaken %0a> man's strength to return to Him, He told them that Adam's sin did not spoil %0a> anything for them. For although there is greatness and holiness in them while %0a> they are in Heaven and no impure forces can cling to them, still this perfection %0a> is incomplete, as they cannot exist in our world, in a place of impure forces. %0a> %0a> The Creator told them: "Hence, you have lost nothing as a result of Adam's %0a> sin, for you are no better than him anyway, as your degree is merely the result %0a> of the place of your residence." And since the Creator's words constitute His %0a> actions, they fell instantly from Heaven to earth (into egoism, of course, not to %0a> the physical earth!). %0a> %0a> And since they came (spiritually descended) to the corporeal life (as %0a> Kabbalah defines it), they began to sort through and analyze the thirty-two parts %0a> of complete egoism, called the "daughters of men," of which the Torah says: %0a> "And the sons of great (angels) saw the daughters of men (egoistic Nukva), that %0a> they were fair (they saw in her an opportunity for egoistic reception of pleasure), %0a> and they took them as wives (used their egoistic desires), whomsoever they chose %0a> (they themselves chose precisely this low state)" (Beresheet, 6:2). For they did not %0a> want to separate the impurity of the thirty-two egoistic parts and prefer only %0a> 288, but took everything they wished, including Lev HaEven. %0a> %0a> Hence, they also transgressed with Nukva Lilit (Lilith) the sinner, and wished %0a> to draw the entire world toward sin, to fling it into the last stage of egoism, for %0a> they did not wish man to return, as it completely contradicts their root. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 331 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> What did the Creator do? He put them in iron chains! For the Creator saw %0a> that if they had the power to return to Heaven after the sin, all the people would %0a> fail in their attempts to aspire to the Creator in their desires, as the dominance %0a> of these egoistic angels (forces) in man would be too great. (Rashi— the great %0a> eleventh century Kabbalist and Biblical commentator— says that the entire Torah %0a> speaks in the words of man. Hence, everything is described in notions of time %0a> and sequence of events. Similarly, the Creator seemingly creates and only then %0a> sees the results of his work). %0a> %0a> Therefore, although their root is quite high, the Creator gave the root of the %0a> impure forces His permission to act (here we see that the Creator governs all the %0a> forces in creation). This root is called Barzel (iron), as it is written: "There was %0a> neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in %0a> building" (Melachim, 1, 6:7), for iron is an impure force. %0a> %0a> And since this impure force clang to the two angels and bound them, %0a> as if with iron chains, by the desires that it dictates to them, such a state is %0a> characterized as being in the mountains of darkness, from which they can no %0a> longer ascend until the end of correction. %0a> %0a> And when they approach the chain of Aza and Azael, rile and rouse them, %0a> it designates the awakening of the fourth part of the will to receive, Malchut %0a> de Malchut, the greatest desire to receive, called "wrath and rage." And they %0a> leap over the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator wishes to bring %0a> justice upon them, for being bound by iron chains, they could not ascend to %0a> their roots and receive Hochma. %0a> %0a> Therefore, this action is considered leaping, an attempt to ascend, followed %0a> by a fall, as a result of which they descend even deeper into the mountains of %0a> darkness. And they think that because of their leaps (attempts to receive the %0a> Light from their root), the Creator is becoming increasingly stricter with them; %0a> thus, they decide to stop leaping. %0a> %0a> However, even though they cannot give anything, as their attempts to reach up %0a> are mere leaps and falls, it is nonetheless enough for the two rulers to receive Ohr %0a> Hochma from them, as this gives them the strength to swim in the sea of Hochma %0a> of the impure force, whereas before they had only the strength to bathe in it. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that there is no action in this exalted impure force, %0a> and everything is limited only in thoughts and desires, for such is the essence %0a> of the impure forces (desires) that separate us from the Creator— before the level %0a> of an action is achieved, purity disappears from it. Therefore, the impure forces %0a> will never reach the level of an action. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 332 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, the work for the impure forces is called Avoda Zara (alien work or %0a> idol worshipping), as it is alien to spiritual work "for the Creator's sake," and %0a> is performed according to the instruction and desires that the impure forces %0a> insert into man's thoughts. In this alien work for an alien master, the Creator %0a> punishes even for mere thoughts and desires, as the prophet said: "That %0a> the house of Israel may understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). %0a> And the sages have said that man is accused and punished even for thoughts, %0a> desires, and doubts in the alien work that transpires in his heart in exactly the same %0a> measure as for a completed action. Hence, the leaps of Aza and Azael are sufficient %0a> in their desire to receive Hochma, although in reality they received nothing. %0a> %0a> 157. And these two Creator-appointed rulers swim in the Great Sea, fly up %0a> from there, and at night go to Naamah, the mother of witches, for whom the %0a> first people fell (Beresheet, 6:1-4). And they wish to approach her, but she %0a> leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot and assumes several different forms, so that people may %0a> be deceived and enticed by her. %0a> %0a> After receiving power from Aza and Azael, they can now make a Zivug with %0a> Naamah, as the first angels Aza and Azael erred. From that Zivug with Aza and %0a> Azael, Naamah gave birth to all the spirits and witches of the world. The Torah %0a> calls Aza and Azael the "sons of Gods" or the "sons of the great" (Beresheet, 6:2). %0a> %0a> Yet, how could such exalted angels stoop to such depraved actions with %0a> Naamah, and why did she give birth to spirits and witches, and not to people? %0a> %0a> The thing is that the Upper World (AVI) was created by the letter Yod, by the %0a> male part, which have nothing of the fourth part of Malchut, called Malchut de %0a> Malchut. However, ZON (the lower world) was created by the letter Hey, which %0a> includes Malchut de Malchut. AVI aspire only to Ohr Hassadim, to altruistic %0a> actions (bestowal), for Bina emerged as such in the four stages of Malchut s birth, %0a> even before the appearance of the first Kli (Malchut de Malchut). %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, ZON need Ohr Hochma, since ZA was created as such in the %0a> four stages of Malchut 's birth. Also, ZA wishes to receive Ohr Hochma within Ohr %0a> Hassadim, which he already has. %0a> %0a> The Zivug of AVI, called the "Upper World," begets angels who desire Ohr %0a> Hassadim, just like AVI, from whom they were born. Human souls are born from %0a> the Zivug of ZON, called the "lower world," and they, like ZON, from whom %0a> they were born, desire only Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> The moment the common soul of all the creatures (Adam) was born from %0a> ZON de Atzilut, ZON existed at the level of the Upper World (AVI) and clothed %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 333 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> it. Like AVI, they, too, ended in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH. And %0a> the letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH was concealed in their posterior side, %0a> Achoraim or AHP. %0a> %0a> Hence, Adam's level was quite high because ZON was in the Upper World %0a> and ended in the letter Yod. The level of ZON was that of the angels that were %0a> born from AVI; therewith, ZON received Ohr Hochma according to their desires, %0a> as ZON are meant to. %0a> %0a> As a result, ZON contain the name Elokim, Supernal Hochma, the perfection %0a> of the Upper World. This is because the ban of the first restriction to not receive %0a> Ohr Hochma does not apply to the letter Yod. Cain and Abel were born from this %0a> state: Cain was born from ELEH and Abel from MI. Malchut herself (the last %0a> letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH) was concealed in them both, and only the %0a> letter Yod was revealed; hence, they contained Supernal Hochma. %0a> %0a> However, on the whole, Hochma is received in Kelim ELEH, ZAT de Bina, %0a> by Cain's soul. This property of Cain is concealed in MI, as the last Hey is %0a> concealed inside Yod, and Cain wanted to make a Zivug with it, to receive Ohr %0a> Hochma in Malchut de Malchut, concealed in Abel's soul. %0a> %0a> It is by this that he slew Abel, for after the last Hey was revealed, the ban %0a> of the first restriction to receive Ohr Hochma in it was revealed. Hence, the %0a> Creator's name Elokim disappeared from them both: MI, since it refers to GAR, %0a> ascended and disappeared (signifying Abel's slaying), and Cain's ELEH, since it %0a> refers to ZAT, fell into the impure forces, called Arka. %0a> %0a> However, although it fell into the impure forces, sparks of Ohr Hochma still %0a> remain in these Kelim (desires), as it is written that his daughters did not suffer %0a> from it greatly, and the sparks of Bina still remained in them. From this we can %0a> understand that Naamah, one of Cain's daughters, was the most beautiful of all %0a> the women in the world, for the sin transpired mainly in Cain's male part, and %0a> not in his female part, as is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 74:2). %0a> %0a> Therefore, after the Creator cast Aza and Azael into this world (created by %0a> the letter Hey), and they've seen Naamah, a new hitherto non-existent desire %0a> appeared within them— the desire to receive Ohr Hochma, for in their essence %0a> they desire only Ohr Hassadim, and only the image of Naamah bore a new desire %0a> for Ohr Hochma within them. %0a> %0a> And since there is no Hey (the last Hey, on which there is a ban to receive %0a> Ohr Hochma) in their essence and in that of Naamah (the last revealed one, for %0a> it originates from Cain's ELEH), they erred in her, thinking that she is able to %0a> receive Ohr Hochma, and made a Zivug with her. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 334 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Their error was twofold: %0a> %0a> 1. Despite the fact that they do not have the last Hey from birth, since %0a> the place determines, and they exist in this world, the last Hey already %0a> governs them, and they are forbidden to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> 2. They thought that the last Hey was absent in Naamah's structure, %0a> when in fact, it was concealed. Hence, spirits and witches were born %0a> from their Zivug. %0a> %0a> From this we can understand what is written in the Talmud (Hagiga, 16:1), %0a> that witches are half-angels half-people, for with regard to their fathers, Aza and %0a> Azael, they are angels, whereas with regard to Naamah, they are like people. But %0a> she could not give birth to people, for the seed within her came from angels, %0a> and not from people. %0a> %0a> The reason for the harm that they cause lies in the fact that they were born %0a> from depravity, the greatest possible distance from the Creator. Hence, their %0a> impurity accompanies them and brings harm wherever it possibly can. Therefore, %0a> The Zohar says that at night they come to Naamah, the mother of witches, for %0a> whom the first people fell (see Beresheet, 6:1-4). %0a> %0a> Indeed, after they received strength from these angels, who were the first to %0a> engage in depravity with Naamah, they could continue to engage in depravity %0a> with her. The Zohar indicates that this is precisely why they come at night, for the %0a> power of Hochma of the impure forces rules only in the darkness of night, the %0a> time of judgment and restrictions, and also as the consequence of roots, namely %0a> Aza and Azael, who reside in the mountains of darkness. %0a> %0a> However, after engaging in depravity with them, she leapt 60,000 Parsa'ot, %0a> i.e., she rose so high that she wanted to annul the Parsa below VAK de AA, whose %0a> each Sefira is defined as 10,000; hence, its VAK = 6 Sefirot equal 60,000. %0a> %0a> But as soon as they think to approach her, she leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot, but %0a> immediately falls back down and is unable to touch them, for there is no action %0a> in these upper impure forces, and all transgressions and all errors are only in %0a> thoughts and intentions. %0a> %0a> Yet, there is still enough power in her to deceive and entice people, even %0a> if man does not reach the level of impure actions and is only drawn to her in %0a> his thoughts and desires. However, the Creator punishes for such thoughts and %0a> desires, as He does for actions, as the prophet warns us: "the house of Israel may %0a> understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). And the impure force assumes %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Heaven and Earth %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 335 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> several different shapes, such as depravity with married women, murder and %0a> other things laid upon Lilit. %0a> %0a> 158. These two rulers soar in the entire world and then return to their %0a> places. And they rouse the sons of Cain's sons with a spirit of evil desires to %0a> beget children. %0a> %0a> "Soar in the entire world"— they bring harm to man in all of their thoughts, %0a> wherever they can, and lure him into the darkness of night. For after man sins, %0a> they return to their permanent place in Arka, where they rouse the sons of Cain %0a> to defile the descendants with impurities. %0a> %0a> Moreover, The Zohar says that besides pushing the sons of Cain to sin in Arka, %0a> they also soar in our world (Tevel), and compel the sons of this land to sin. %0a> %0a> 159. The Heavens that rule there are not like ours, and the land bears neither %0a> seed nor fruit by the power of Heaven, as ours does, and the grains grow again %0a> only once in several years. Hence, it is written of them that they could not correct %0a> Shemaya and Arka, and perished from the Supernal land, called Tevel, where %0a> they will not be able to exist, nor rule over it, nor cause human beings to sin %0a> because of the night. Hence, they disappeared from Arka and from the place of %0a> Shemaya that were created by the name ELEH (as mentioned in item 14). %0a> %0a> Our Heavens receive the Light essential for the birth of subsequent Partzufim %0a> from ZA, which has Ohr Hochma. Hence, our land, which receives in Malchut de %0a> ZA, receives a grain and a seed. %0a> %0a> However, the Heavens in Arka do not have the Light to bear fruit and give %0a> birth due to the rule of the impure forces that are there. Hence, unlike our land, %0a> Arka cannot produce; its land has no power to receive and grow a seed, and this %0a> property appears in it only once in several years. %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar speaks of the two rulers: Afriron and Kastimon, who could %0a> not correct Shemaya and Arka, to make them bear fruit. Therefore, these rulers %0a> are not allowed to be here and seduce people in our land (Tevel), to sin, for %0a> when they are here, they bring harm to our land so as to make it like their %0a> Shemaya and Arka. %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar says that they disappeared from the Supernal land of %0a> Tevel, from our land, for here they sought to bring harm by the power of the %0a> night. They provoke people toward sin by virtue of the night, and it is a curse %0a> that hangs over Arka because of their rule there. %0a> %0a> Our Heavens were created by the name ELEH, for our Heavens receive %0a> from ZA, which was corrected by ELEH's properties, by the words: IN THE %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 336 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED, where MI is connected to ELEH. %0a> Hence, our land is corrected by the Supernal holiness and purity. Therefore, %0a> these two rulers are not allowed to rule here. %0a> %0a> 160. Hence, there exists a Targum, a translation (from Hebrew to Aramaic, %0a> which The Zohar dubs Targum), so the holy angels will not think that it %0a> is said about them, so they will not harm us. This is the secret of the word %0a> ELEH— as we have already stated, it is a holy word that cannot be translated %0a> into a Targum. %0a> %0a> Everything but the word ELEH has been translated into the language of %0a> the Targum, as it is said in item 149, that ELEH disappeared from both Arka %0a> and Shemaya, for the word ELEH is untranslatable, as it constitutes the full %0a> connection between ELEH and MI, which causes the descent of Ohr Hochma. %0a> And should anyone sin and corrupt the letters ELEH, as Cain had done, they %0a> would fall to the impure forces, so even the holiness of the Targum (VAK of the %0a> pure forces) would depart from them. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Among All the Sages of the Nations %0a> of the World, There Are None Like You %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 161. Rabbi Elazar said, "It is written: 'Who would not fear the King of the %0a> nations of the world?' What kind of praise is this?" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a> "Elazar, my son, this has been said in several places. However, one should %0a> not understand the verse, 'For among all the sages of the nations of the %0a> world, and in all their kingdoms, there are none like You' in its simple, literal %0a> interpretation. This is because it naturally gives rise to evil intentions of %0a> sinners— those who think that the Creator is not aware of their dark thoughts, %0a> doubts and intents. Therefore, their folly must be clarified. A philosopher %0a> of one of the nations of the world came to me and said, 'You say that your %0a> Creator governs the entire Heavens, and that all the Heavenly hosts are unable %0a> to attain Him, nor come to know His dwelling place. However, this does not %0a> add to His greatness, as it is written, 'among all the sages of the nations of %0a> the world, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.' What kind of a %0a> comparison is this when He is compared to man, who is nothing?'" %0a> %0a> This is similar to what is written about sinners in Psalms (Tehilim, 73:11-12): %0a> "And they say: 'How does the Creator know? And is there knowledge in Him? %0a> Behold the wicked; they are always at peace, rich and powerful.'" This is exactly %0a> what the philosopher says. He was one of the greatest sages among the nations of %0a> the world, and he came to Rabbi Shimon to dishonor Israel's wisdom and work %0a> in absolute faith for the Creator's sake, which ought to be in great wholeness, %0a> perfection, purity, and integrity, for no thought can grasp Him. %0a> %0a> This sage was a representative of the philosophers who asserted that the %0a> main principle in working for the Creator is to attain Him, rather than serve %0a> Him in faith, for in their understanding, they attain Him. And now he has %0a> come to ridicule Israel's approach. %0a> %0a> 337 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 338 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, he said: "The Creator is above all human wisdom, and thereby He %0a> rules, and He bid you to work for Him in faith and purity, and have no doubts in %0a> Him, for the human mind cannot grasp Him. After all, even the Heavenly hosts, %0a> His legions and angels are unable to attain Him, as it is written of those who say: %0a> 'Blessed be the Creator in His place,' for they do not know 'His place.'" %0a> %0a> However, the phrase, "as among all the sages of the world, there is none like %0a> the Creator" does not imply the Creator's greatness. Indeed, if this prophetic %0a> expression is used in order to exalt the God of Israel and show that He is greater %0a> than the god attained by the sages of the nations of the world by their human %0a> strength and reason, then naturally, this does not add to the glory of the God of %0a> Israel, as He is being compared to trifle and transient forces. On the contrary, %0a> this statement shows great disdain for your Creator, when you compare Him to %0a> the sages of the nations of the world, who are mortal and restricted creatures. %0a> Those were the words that the scholarly sage, who represented the wisdom of %0a> the nations of the world, uttered before Rabbi Shimon. %0a> %0a> Clearly, The Zohar is referring to some overseas sage who paid a visit to Rabbi %0a> Shimon. Just like all the other names of places and characters mentioned in the %0a> Torah, the Talmud, and the Kabbalah, names of places, animals, people, and %0a> actions described in The Zohar speak only of the spiritual world, the Creator's %0a> actions, and how one can achieve the goal of creation. In no way does any of this %0a> relate to events in our world! %0a> %0a> Therefore, the "sage of the nations of the world" symbolizes man's own %0a> egoistic property to research and know everything, instead of having faith above %0a> reason, as the Torah demands. This human property, called a "sage of the %0a> nations of the world," the egoistic reason, is in a state of constant argument %0a> with man's spiritual, altruistic property, called "Israel" or the aspiration to the %0a> Creator. Thus, by opposing it, man builds himself and grows. %0a> %0a> 162. Furthermore, you claim, as your Torah says, that "There had not risen %0a> a prophet since in Israel like Moshe." There are none in Israel, but there is %0a> one among the nations of the world! So I claim the same: there is none like %0a> You among all the sages of the nations of the world, but among the sages of %0a> Israel there is one like You. However, if there is one like Him among the sages %0a> of Israel, then He cannot be the Supreme Ruler. Look closely into my words, %0a> and you shall see that I am right. %0a> %0a> Here the philosopher (man's egoistic voice) spoke wisely. He understood %0a> that should he speak directly, he would hear precise answers to his questions. It %0a> is written: "Among all the sages of the nations of the world, there are none like %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 339 %0a> %0a> You," meaning that there is no one that can attain You. For the words, "there %0a> are none like You" imply that You have no equals, that it is impossible to attain %0a> You, attain Your degree. %0a> %0a> However, since the sages of the nations of the world (human reason) take %0a> pride in their attainment of the Creator (that they understand His intentions %0a> and actions), they consider themselves similar to Him, for attainment means %0a> similarity of properties with the attained degree. This is why it is considered a %0a> lie, and that there are none like Him, for they do not attain the Creator, but %0a> only delude themselves by thinking that they do. %0a> %0a> The philosopher (within man) understood that, and hence began (leading %0a> man astray from the path of faith, which surpasses and defies reason) with a %0a> completely different question: "If it is explicitly said that no one is equal to the %0a> Creator among the sages of the other nations, does it not mean that there are %0a> those who can attain Him among the sages of Israel? Otherwise, why would it be %0a> necessary to specify that there are none like Him among the sages of the nations %0a> of the world? %0a> %0a> "But if this is so, and He is similar to you, then He cannot be the Supreme %0a> Ruler! Thus, how can you say that the God of Israel cannot be attained by %0a> reason and that He governs all? You speak by means of faith in His greatness, %0a> but indeed there are those among your sages who are like Him, i.e., those who %0a> attain Him." %0a> %0a> 163. Rabbi Shimon said to him, "You object correctly that there are those %0a> among the sages of Israel who are similar to the Creator, for who resurrects %0a> the dead back to life, if not the Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu and Elisha %0a> came and resurrected the dead back to life! Who causes rain to fall if not the %0a> Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu came and abolished rain, and then summoned %0a> it through his prayer! Who created the Heavens and the earth, if not the %0a> Creator Himself? Yet, Avraham came, and, as it is written, the Heavens and %0a> the earth were revived." %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon replies that the (inner) sage speaks the truth when he %0a> asserts that there are those among the sages of Israel who are similar to the %0a> Creator. However, in no way does this revoke the simple faith in the Creator's %0a> unattainability by human reason. Of course, He is the master and ruler of the %0a> Heavens, and He is so much higher than all of them that even the Supernal %0a> angels cannot attain Him and do not know His place. %0a> %0a> Yet, the Torah and Mitzvot (commandments) were given to us precisely for %0a> this purpose— so that by observing the Mitzvot (making a Zivug between the screen %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 340 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> and the Light) and studying the Torah (receiving the Light) for the Creator's %0a> sake, we, Israel (those who aspire to the Creator) would completely merge with %0a> Him (in our properties), so His Light would permeate us and clothe in us to %0a> such an extent that we would merit (begin to desire and receive the power of %0a> a screen) carrying out the same actions as the Creator: resurrecting the dead %0a> (correcting egoism), summoning rains (Ohr Hassadim), and reviving Heaven and %0a> earth (filling all the Partzufim in all the worlds with the Light of our actions). %0a> %0a> In that, we are just like Him, as it is said: "By Your deeds (by experiencing %0a> them on myself) I will know You." However, we attain all this only through %0a> absolute and devout faith (the property of Bind), which leaves within us no %0a> desires whatsoever to attain Him with our reason (to verify first and act next), %0a> as in the path of sages of the nations of the world (our egoism). Our egoism %0a> consists of a Partzuf called a "sage of the nations of the world." Its Rosh (head) %0a> designates knowledge and desire to attain everything, and its Guf (body) is the %0a> will to receive pleasure for oneself. %0a> %0a> The philosopher argues that if Israel can do what the Creator does, then %0a> Israel attains Him. This is correct, for if one is able to act like the Creator, then, %0a> to the extent of his actions, he attains and perceives Him. After all, it is said: "By %0a> Your deeds I will know You." If one acts like the Creator, then he understands %0a> the Creator's analogous actions in his own actions, and thus perceives Him. %0a> However, one must first advance by faith above reason, and as a result, he attains %0a> the Creator's properties, thereby becoming like Him in his actions. %0a> %0a> 164. (Rabbi Shimon continues:) "Who governs the sun, if not the Creator? %0a> Yet, Yehoshua came and stopped it. The Creator issues His decree, yet Moshe %0a> immediately issues a decree of his own, and it is carried out. The Creator wishes %0a> to punish, and the righteous of Israel annul His verdict. Moreover, He bid us %0a> to closely follow His ways and to be like Him in every way." The philosopher %0a> then went and became Israel, and lived in the village of Shachalayim, and they %0a> called him Yosi HaKatan (Little Yosi). He studied the Torah a great deal, and %0a> was among the sages and the righteous of that village. %0a> %0a> The problem is that if a person does everything only by means of his faith, %0a> he denies himself the chance to attain the Creator, for attainment comes %0a> through applying reason. However, the moment he begins to apply his reason, he %0a> immediately diminishes his faith. So how can one combine faith with reason? %0a> %0a> It is true that those who aspire to draw nearer the Creator (those who are %0a> called Israel) diminish their simple, devout faith. However, they do this only %0a> because He bids them to do so in order to attain His actions, and thus become %0a> like Him, as it is said in the Torah: "Follow His way" (Devarim, 21). Hence, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 341 %0a> %0a> they observe His commandments. The philosopher was so overwhelmed by this %0a> truth that he became "Israel" and started observing the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> He was overwhelmed when he had found that Israel's actions, their %0a> attainments of the spiritual worlds, did not diminish their faith above reason, for %0a> all of their actions and attainments were based on faith. Israel attains the Creator %0a> because He bids them to, not because they desire this with their egoism. %0a> %0a> 165. And now the time has come to take a closer look at this verse. It is %0a> written that all the nations of the world are nothing before Him. Yet, how %0a> does this exalt Him? Hence, it is written: "Who sees the King of the nations %0a> of the world?" Yet, is the King of the nations of the world also not the King of %0a> Israel? The Creator wishes to elevate Israel in all places; this is why He is called %0a> everywhere "the King of Israel." The other nations of the world say that they %0a> have another King up in the Heavens, for it seems to them that He governs %0a> only them, and not us. %0a> %0a> The nations of the world are certain that their Supernal King is not the %0a> King of Israel, that the King who sits in the Heavens and governs them is %0a> only their King, and that the King of Israel has no power over them. Thus, it %0a> seems to man's egoism that it exists under some other (non-altruistic) system of %0a> governance, and not altruism. The egoism fails to realize that the Creator made %0a> it exactly the way it is so as to achieve His goal: using egoism, to bring man to %0a> altruism, from "for one's own self to "for the Creator's sake." %0a> %0a> 166. It is written: "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" %0a> (Xirmiyahu, 10:7) That is, their Supernal King is there to threaten and %0a> persecute them, and do with them as He pleases. Hence, He should be feared. %0a> And all fear Him Above and below. For it is written that among all the sages of %0a> the nations of the world (the angels that rule over these nations) and in their %0a> Kingdoms (Above) there is none like You. There are four Kingdoms Above %0a> that rule over all the nations of the world according to the Creator's will. And %0a> there is no one who can do even the smallest action without His personal %0a> instruction. The sages of the nations of the world are the forces that rule them %0a> from Above, and all the wisdom of the nations of the world comes from these %0a> rulers. "In all their Kingdoms" means that the Creator's will rules over them. %0a> %0a> These lines describe how the bride, who is in a state of exile, prepares herself %0a> for her future, final correction. The power of the nations of the world (in every %0a> one of us) amounts to conquering us (the altruistic desires for the Creator) and %0a> placing us under their power (serving only the body). They wish to drive us away %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 342 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> from the Creator's rule and let other desires, called "the nations of the world" %0a> dominate us. Our egoistic desires, the nations of the world, do so because of %0a> their power (tempting us with various pleasures) and wisdom (appealing to our %0a> common sense). %0a> %0a> Their actions over us (spiritual aspirations) stem from the system of the %0a> impure forces and their impure (egoistic) angels (our inner egoistic forces), %0a> which give power and reason to the nations of the world. With the help of %0a> their wisdom, they (our egoistic desires) lead us (the sons of Israel, those who %0a> aspire only to the Creator) to all sorts of doubts and desires to understand %0a> the Creator, His ways and thoughts, without any fear or reverence before His %0a> greatness and supremacy. %0a> %0a> Because of these doubts, we draw far from the Creator and His Supernal %0a> Light, which, as a result, passes on to them (our egoistic desires), as it is %0a> written, "Tzur (the capital of the impure forces) was built only on the ruins of %0a> Jerusalem (the capital of the pure forces)." Thus, they acquire the strength to %0a> persecute and humiliate Israel, and force them to submit to their will (suppress %0a> the only true path to the spiritual— faith above and in defiance of reason— with %0a> their persuasions and proof of their "real" rightfulness). And as it was already %0a> explained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar" (items 69-71), our inner %0a> spiritual enslavement leads to our external, corporeal enslavement, persecution, %0a> and humiliation by the nations of the world. %0a> %0a> This is the secret of the four Kingdoms that rule over us in our four (spiritual %0a> and therefore physical) exiles, which correspond to Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, symbolized %0a> by Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written: "Here is that idol, its head made of pure %0a> gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its shins of %0a> iron, and its feet part iron and part clay" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a> %0a> When this idol governs us, the nations of the world mock us, claiming %0a> that they have a King of their own. However, such was the Creator's plan, as %0a> it is said: "The Creator hath so made it, that men should fear Him" (Kohelet, %0a> 3:14), for the sensation of the Creator, called Shechina, is also referred to as fear %0a> before Him. However, since we do not yet feel the greatness and supremacy of %0a> the Creator, we do not merit fearing Him, and live in fear of the King of the %0a> nations of the world. %0a> %0a> This points to the fact that we have no other way of completely and eternally %0a> merging with the Creator other than by means of tremendous fear before His %0a> greatness, by assuming His Torah and His desires (Mitzvot) in devout and %0a> complete faith, without any doubts in His properties. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 343 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Only then will we merge with Him in absolute, eternal union, and the %0a> Creator will impart us with all the goodness for which He had created us. He %0a> conceived this in the beginning of creation, and it became the purpose behind %0a> the whole of creation. This state is considered the complete and final deliverance %0a> and correction. %0a> %0a> However, before the attainment of such an exalted spiritual state, this is how %0a> the prophet describes those who aspire to the Creator: "You have sown much, %0a> and brought in little; you eat but you have not enough; you drink but your thirst %0a> is not quenched" (Haggai, 1:6), for in all of our actions (of those who aspire to %0a> the spiritual) the impure force (egoism) constantly takes all the Light for itself. %0a> This occurs as a result of our doubts with regard to faith in the Creator, which %0a> the impure force itself cultivates within us. %0a> %0a> However, the purpose of these punishments is not to cause us grief! Everything %0a> happens according to the Creator's plan and serves only to promote us toward %0a> correction. Therefore, as long as man can listen only to egoistic arguments, the %0a> Creator develops us gradually, using these forces. With their help, we gradually %0a> become fit to feel fear of the Creator, through the many trials and sufferings our %0a> %0a> But in the end, we merit the reception of complete and devoted faith and fear %0a> before His greatness. It is written of this state: "He remembered His mercy and His %0a> allegiance toward the house of Israel, and all the worthless creatures of the earth %0a> witnessed the help and deliverance at the Creator's hands" (Tehilim, 98:3). %0a> %0a> This is because at the end of days, the Creator will remember us in His %0a> mercy, and will give us the strength to receive complete and devout faith in Him. %0a> Thus, Jerusalem (the capital of altruism) will be rebuilt on the ruins of Tzur %0a> (the capital of egoism), for all the Light, which Malchut of the impure force was %0a> robbing of us throughout our exile from the spiritual, will return to us when we %0a> acquire complete and devout faith, and will shine within us with all its might. %0a> %0a> All the worthless creatures of the earth (manifestations of egoism) will then %0a> see with their own eyes how our Creator saves (corrects) them. For all the nations %0a> of the world (within us) will see that they have always possessed this Light until %0a> the very last moment before their correction so as to give it back to us at the %0a> appropriate time. And all shall see that "one man's rule over another is to the %0a> detriment of the ruler!" (Kohelet, 8:9). %0a> %0a> The burden of our slavery and the impure force's rule over us (over holiness) %0a> harms only the impure force, for it thereby compels us to attain complete and %0a> devoted faith in the Creator even faster! And the prophet speaks of this time, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 344 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> At they %0a> „He m %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" for it has now been %0a> revealed that He is the King of the nations of the world, who persecutes and %0a> dominates those nations. It previously seemed to them (our egoistic intentions) %0a> that they persecuted us (our altruistic intentions), but now the opposite has %0a> been revealed to them— that they were merely blind enactors of the Creator's %0a> will, our servants and our slaves, whose purpose is to bring us to perfection. %0a> %0a> It seemed to us that they were beating us. Now it turns out that they were beat- %0a> ; themselves, for thanks to these blows (suffering from unrealized egoistic desires %0a> it frustration), they have accelerated our deliverance and attainr %0a> )ur realization of the need to choose the path of faith above re %0a> have also accelerated their own demise (their own correctior %0a> %0a> And wherever it seemed to us (our reason) that they rebelled against the %0a> Creator (argued that the Creator is not the source of all reality) and acted %0a> (supposedly) however they pleased so as to humiliate us and satiate their base %0a> egoistic desires, and it appeared that there was no (Supernal) judge and no law %0a> (the advancement of creation toward its goal), it has now been revealed that they %0a> have always been fulfilling the Creator's will, to bring us (all our desires, %0a> included) to perfection. %0a> %0a> The same applies to every person in the world— whether he wants to or not, %0a> at all times and in every way, he fulfills only the Creator's will. Why then is he %0a> not called the Creator's servant? Because he acts unconsciously, not of his own %0a> will. To compel man to fulfill His will, the Creator gives him some alien desire %0a> to enjoy, which forces him to carry out an action, but he does so as a slave of his %0a> and not as someone who fulfills the Creator's will. %0a> %0a> ample, the Creator may give man an alien desire %0a> vpelling him to open a restaurant so as to carry out : %0a> egoistic desire. %0a> %0a> In other words, to compel us to do what is necessary, the Creator created %0a> within us an egoistic desire to receive pleasure, thus obliging us to do His will %0a> by enabling us to find pleasure in the actions and objects on which He wants %0a> us to work. This is why we live in constant chase of pleasures, whereas in truth %0a> istantly and unconsciously fulfilling the Creator's will. This resembles %0a> which children are given many toys to play with, but as they play, %0a> vork. %0a> %0a> rid is doing the Creator's will, but our goal, the pur %0a> lopment is to do it consciously.

And now fear before the Creator is revealed to all %0a> the nations of the world. The phrase, "all the nations of the world" alludes to %0a> the angels that rule over those nations, such as Afriron, Kastimon, Aza, Azael %0a> and others, from whom the sages of the nations of the world (our egoism and %0a> reason) receive their wisdom, and with whose help they oppress Israel (our %0a> altruistic desires). %0a> %0a> IN THEIR KINGDOMS refers to the four existing Kingdoms, which %0a> govern the seventy nations of the world (ZON = seven Sefirot, each of which %0a> containing ten sub-Se/irot: in all seventy Sefirot) and over us (altruistic aspirations) %0a> in our four exiles, which correspond to the impure Sefirot H-B-ZA-M (described %0a> as Nebuchadnezzar). As the prophet writes: "Here is that idol, its head made %0a> of pure gold (the first Kingdom), its breast and its arms of silver (the second %0a> Kingdom), its belly and its thighs of brass (the third Kingdom), its shins of iron, %0a> its feet part iron and part clay (the fourth Kingdom)" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a> %0a> There is not one among them who can make even the smallest action of %0a> their own, but only what You bid them. However, this will only be revealed at %0a> the end of correction, and all will know that all of our misfortunes and suffering %0a> that had the power to separate us from the Creator were but loyal executors of %0a> the Creator's aspiration to draw us closer to Him. Moreover, these cruel forces %0a> did nothing else but obey His orders. %0a> %0a> And the sole purpose of all that transpired was to bring us to a state where %0a> we can receive all the perfection and infinite goodness that He intended to %0a> bestow upon us from the very beginning in His plan of creation. The Creator %0a> must lead us to complete and devout faith, the result of which will be, as the %0a> prophet said: "Then, at once, the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the %0a> gold all crumbled to pieces and became like the chaff on summer threshing- %0a> floors; and the wind carried them away, and no trace was left of them; and the %0a> stone that smote their image became a great mountain, and filled the whole %0a> earth" (Daniel, 2:35). %0a> %0a> Absolute faith is called "unbreakable (non-crumbling) stone." After one %0a> merits absolute faith, the impure force (his inner egoistic desires and thoughts) %0a> disappears as though it had never existed. And all the worthless creatures %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 346 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> (reason, logic, philosophy, and common sense), which inhabit the earth, witness %0a> deliverance at the hands of the Creator, as the prophet said: "They shall not %0a> do evil nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the %0a> knowledge of the Lord, as the waters fill the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a> %0a> 167. Yet, among all the sages of the nations of the world and in all their %0a> kingdoms, I have found in the ancient books that even though the Heavenly %0a> hosts and legions fully obeyed their given orders and each would receive precise %0a> instructions to be carried out, but who among them can do it if not You, who %0a> will do it better than You? For You excel over them all in both properties and %0a> deeds. Hence, it is written: "There is none like You." %0a> %0a> itures' actions with His Light, %0a> to His goal. Man's sole task is the realization of all creation ar %0a> ;rnance, to wholeheartedly agree with all of the Creator's actions, ar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 168. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "This wedding must be a wedding for %0a> all of you, and each of you should bring a gift (his own part in the common %0a> Malchut) to the Bride." He said to Rabbi Elazar, his son: "Present the Bride %0a> with a gift, for on the following day Zeir Anpin will look as he enters the %0a> wedding canopy at the sound of these songs and praises of the sons of the %0a> wedding canopy, who stand before the Creator." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is This? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 169. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "Who is this coming up from the %0a> wasteland?" (Shir HaShirim, 3:6). MI ZOT— who is this— is the common %0a> ground of the two questions, the two worlds, Bina and Malchut, which are %0a> bound together. COMING UP— coming up to become the "Holy of Holies." %0a> For MI is Bina, called the Holy of Holies. And she joins with ZOT (Malchut), %0a> so that Malchut could come up FROM THE WASTELAND, for she inherits %0a> THIS from the wasteland, to become a bride and enter the bridal canopy. %0a> %0a> The Zohar explains the following passage: "Who is this coming up from the %0a> wasteland, leaning upon her beloved!?" (Shir HaShirim, 8:5). It describes a state %0a> at the end of correction, when the bride enters the wedding canopy. MI ZOT: %0a> MI is Bina and ZOT is Malchut. At the end of correction, Bina and Malchut %0a> unite, and both are called "holy." But until the end of correction only Bina is %0a> called holy, while Malchut ascends to Bina and receives holiness from her. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, at the end of correction, Malchut becomes like Bina, and they %0a> both become holy. Malchut completely unites with Bina through equivalence %0a> of form, and fully merges with the source of life, for a screen (the restriction %0a> imposed on reception of Light within Malchut) creates the Returning Light that %0a> combines all Sefirot into one. %0a> %0a> The Creator's Ohr Hochma can be received precisely in this Returning Light. %0a> As a result, Malchut ends with the letter Yod and becomes forever similar to Bina. %0a> Hence, it is written that Malchut and Bina unite by equalizing their desires to %0a> form a single whole. %0a> %0a> Similarly, the Light of Malchut will be forever connected to the Light of Bina, %0a> for Malchut herself ascends to the level of the "Holy of Holies," thus becoming %0a> exactly like Bina. SHE COMES UP just like a sacrifice, which is the "Holy of %0a> Holies," for MI (AVI, Bina or the "Holy of Holies") joins ZOT (Malchut), so %0a> %0a> 347 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 348 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut would ascend and become the "Holy of Holies." Sacrifice is the part of %0a> Malchut (man's animal egoism) that ascends with its properties to Bina. %0a> %0a> And when MI (Bina) joins ZOT (Malchut), and ZOT becomes the "Holy of %0a> Holies," there is no longer a diminution of Malchut's state, for this diminution %0a> occurred only because of the deterioration of Malchut's properties, when new %0a> egoistic desires emerge within her. %0a> %0a> Now that Malchut has become as holy (altruistic) in her properties as Bina, %0a> death disappears, and the fall of Malchut into her egoistic desires is impossible, %0a> for she has been fully corrected and has attained the properties of Bina, which are %0a> referred to as holy. Through Malchut's acquisition of these properties, the Upper %0a> Light (life) enters her. Malchut emerges from the wasteland (the sensation of %0a> life's absence for want of altruistic properties) and enters her wedding canopy. %0a> %0a> This occurs thanks to man's efforts, called "those who keep the Torah" %0a> (item 124). These efforts are the foremost part of creation, for they create the %0a> Torah and bring Malchut to the great Zivug at the end of her correction, to her %0a> complete fulfillment with the Light. This great Zivug on the entire corrected %0a> Malchut (including Malchut de Malchut) can be achieved by precisely this sensation %0a> (by man) of the spiritual wasteland. %0a> %0a> 170. She comes up from the wasteland of the soft utterance of lips, as it is %0a> written, "And your mouth is comely" (Shir HaShirim, 4:3). This is because %0a> the Hebrew word Midbar (desert/wasteland) is derived from Dibur (speech). %0a> It is written of the mighty forces, that these mighty forces strike Egypt with all %0a> the plagues of the wasteland, for all that the Creator did to them was not in %0a> the wasteland, but in settlements. And the phrase "in the wasteland" means %0a> "by the power of speech, of spoken word." This comes up from articulation, %0a> from the mouth (Malchut) as she ascends and comes under the wings of Ima %0a> (mother, Bina). Then, through speech, she descends upon the entire holy %0a> nation (the difference between speech and articulation is that articulation is %0a> an action that forms speech). %0a> %0a> Before the end of correction, when Malchut is still called the "Tree of Good %0a> and Evil," all corrections occur through MAN (prayers or requests), through %0a> which the righteous (those who wish to become similar to the Creator in their %0a> properties) elevate Malchut to Bina. Consequently, Malchut receives Bina's %0a> properties for as long as Malchut remains there, for spiritual ascent signifies an %0a> attainment of properties. Malchut becomes as holy (altruistic) as Bina. %0a> %0a> MAN is a silent prayer in the heart of man, for Malchut signifies "speech." %0a> Yet, until the end of correction, good words cannot exist without bad ones. That %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is This? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 349 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> is, this will not happen until both voice and speech come from Bina herself, when %0a> Malchut becomes like Bina, which designates the unity of voice and speech— the %0a> Zivug of ZON in their corrected state of Gadlut. %0a> %0a> ZA receives the voice from Ima and passes it in his speech to Malchut. Hence, %0a> this speech is completely good, devoid of any evil. Thus, Malchut receives from %0a> Bina the Light of holiness, Hassadim. Unless it is corrected by the completely %0a> good, altruistic voice of Bina, Malchut's voice will always consist of both good %0a> and evil. This is why impure, egoistic forces cling to her, and Malchut cannot %0a> receive anything from holiness (Bina). %0a> %0a> Hence, MAN that the righteous raise in their prayers is like a soft murmur %0a> of lips, a voiceless speech, as the prophet says: "Only the lips move, but the %0a> voice cannot be heard" (Shmuel I, 1:13). This is because there is no connection %0a> between MAN and the impure force, and Malchut can be elevated to Bina so she %0a> can receive her voice from Bina. %0a> %0a> As a result, a holy edifice of Malchut is erected, and she receives the %0a> Light from a Zivug between voice and speech, and the holiness of her speech %0a> descends upon the heads of the righteous that raised MAN and thereby %0a> revived Malchut. %0a> %0a> This is why it is written that SHE COMES UP FROM THE WASTELAND, %0a> for the bride (Malchut) is now invited to a great Zivug under the wedding canopy. %0a> This occurs thanks to the raising of MAN by the righteous, who thereby united %0a> Bina (voice, Ima) with Malchut (speech). As a result, Malchut's speech became as %0a> beautiful as that of Bina. %0a> %0a> All of these individual Zivugim made by the various righteous (each of whom %0a> constitutes a small part of the common Malchut) during the 6,000 years, now %0a> connect all of Malchut 's parts (souls of the righteous) together in one great Zivug, %0a> as the bride (Malchut) enters her wedding canopy. %0a> %0a> In other words, it is precisely this soft prayer, the raising of MAN during the %0a> 6,000 years by a voiceless speech (seeing as good is still mixed with evil in the %0a> voice of Malchut), that creates the conditions for the great Zivug of Malchut with %0a> ZA, of man with the Creator. %0a> %0a> And since Malchut received the voice of Bina (from Ima-Mother) thanks %0a> to the help of the righteous (all the good deeds performed by the righteous %0a> during the 6,000 years), everything is now combined into the great Supernal %0a> Zivug under the wedding canopy. This is because Malchut becomes completely %0a> good without a hint of evil— the "Holy of Holies," just like Ima. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 350 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Silent speech is defined as the movement of lips without the participation of %0a> the palate, larynx, tongue, and teeth. This is how MAN is raised when Malchut %0a> ascends between the wings of Bina, i.e., receives the voice of the wings of Ima %0a> in her speech. Afterwards, having acquired the speech, she descends upon the %0a> heads of the holy nation. For after the reception of voice through Ima 's property %0a> of mercy, Malchut becomes as holy as Bina herself, and her holiness descends %0a> upon those who corrected her. Consequently, they are called the "holy nation," %0a> for now the speech of Malchut is as holy as that of Ima-Bina. %0a> %0a> There is "voice" and there is "speech." "Voice" is the inner part, whereas %0a> "speech" is its outward appearance. This appearance is based on exhaling (the %0a> silent letter Hey). ZA is called "voice," and Malchut is called "speech." Letters %0a> are sung according to the note signs (Taamim), followed by the letters with their %0a> punctuation marks. %0a> %0a> The level of Ohr Haya (called Kol— voice) emerges on the screen in the Peh of %0a> the third degree of thickness, known as "teeth." From this Light ZA receives Ohr %0a> Hochma, and his voice is then heard outside (begets the souls of the lower ones). %0a> %0a> Yet, the voice of ZA is not heard below the level of Neshama, for his screen is %0a> not strong enough to receive Ohr Hochma. The level of Ohr Yechida in ZA, called %0a> Dibur (speech), emerges on the screen in the Peh of the fourth degree of thickness. %0a> This screen is the most powerful, as it reveals all of the Light, and is called "lips." %0a> %0a> The Light of NRNHY reveals the inner, Supernal and concealed wisdom, %0a> Hochma, the concealed thought, the inner Light of Bina, which cannot shine %0a> to the lower ones, that is, in ZA, because ZON cannot receive from Peh de AA. %0a> Nevertheless, the two levels of the Light— Haya and Yechida— that descend from %0a> AA are converted into voice and speech with Bina 's help, even though it is the %0a> Light of thought, wisdom and reason. %0a> %0a> Voice is formed in ZA, and speech in Malchut. If a righteous one raises his %0a> prayers (MAN) to Malchut, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI, who are in %0a> constant union, to provide Light for the lower ones, ZON receive this Light %0a> from AVI, which is called "voice and speech." The property of the righteous is to %0a> create the pure and destroy the impure with their voice. In the beginning, there %0a> was only one language (one speech) in the world, Lashon HaKodesh— the holy %0a> language. In Hebrew (as in English) the same word (Lashon) means "tongue" %0a> (both as a body part and as a means of communication). %0a> %0a> 171. He asks: "How does Malchut ascend in speech?" And he replies: "When %0a> man first awakens in the morning and opens his eyes, he must bless his %0a> Creator and Master. How is he to bless Him? The way it was done by the first %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is This? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 351 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hassidimi they would prepare a vessel of water beside them, so that when they %0a> woke at night, they would wash their hands at once, and, having blessed the %0a> Torah, would rise to study it. When the rooster crowed, precisely heralding %0a> midnight, the Creator was with the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And it %0a> is forbidden to perform a blessing in the morning with unclean hands." %0a> %0a> He asks: since it is written that the beginning of Malchut's correction must %0a> be expressed in a quiet murmur of lips, how can he who wakes up (spiritually) %0a> immediately pronounce a blessing at the top of his voice? After all, the blessing %0a> must also be uttered in whisper so as to first receive a voice from Ima, and with %0a> this voice (by the force of Ima-Bina) elevate Malchut to Bina, and impart onto her %0a> altruistic properties. %0a> %0a> The Zohar replies: The first Hassidim have corrected this. As man falls asleep %0a> (falls to the level of the Light in his Partzuf called "sleep"), his holy soul (the %0a> Light that was in his spiritual Partzuf) ascends, and only the impure spirit of the %0a> primordial serpent (egoistic properties) remains in him, for sleep constitutes the %0a> 60 th part of death (Talmud, Berachot, 57:2). %0a> %0a> Since death is an impure property of the primordial serpent, the impure %0a> spirit (egoistic desires) does not leave man completely as he wakes up (receives %0a> a new Light from Above), but remains on man's fingertips (not all of man's %0a> desires change under the influence of the Light received from Above, called %0a> "the Light of morning" or "the Light of awakening"). %0a> %0a> And the greater holiness and Light that was present in man before he fell %0a> asleep (before he fell into a diminished spiritual state, called "sleep"), the more %0a> the impure (egoistic) force clings to these desires when the altruistic intentions %0a> exit them during sleep. %0a> %0a> Fingertips constitute the purest place (desires) of the entire body (all desires), %0a> man's most spiritual desires, for they can be filled with Ohr Hochma (Ohr Hochma %0a> enters these desires during a Zivug, with the help of a screen). Therefore, even %0a> after awakening (at the beginning of the spiritual ascent), the impure (egoistic) %0a> force does not leave this place, wishing to receive at least some of that great %0a> Light, which can fill these most altruistic human desires. %0a> %0a> Hence, hands must be washed in order to remove the residual egoistic %0a> desires. For this to happen, two vessels need to be prepared: the Upper One %0a> (cup) and the lower one that will accept the removed impurity. %0a> %0a> The Upper Vessel designates Bina, whose Light drives the impure force away. %0a> Hence, washing the fingertips with water (the forces or desires of Bina) expels %0a> the impure force (man's egoistic desires) from them. Thus, Malchut rids herself %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 352 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of her evil (egoism) and becomes holy and good. Afterwards, one can study the %0a> Torah and bless the Creator for it, for washing hands is similar to raising MAN %0a> in a whispered prayer to the wings of Ima. %0a> %0a> And when the rooster crows (this is a special spiritual sign of the angel %0a> Gavriel), it is precisely midnight, as it is written: "The greater star to rule the day %0a> and the lesser star to rule the night" (Beresheet, 1:16). For the lesser star, the holy %0a> Shechina-Malchut grew smaller, clothed in impure forces and "her feet descend %0a> to death" (Mishley, 5:5). %0a> %0a> This is so because during the 6,000 years, up to her final correction, %0a> Malchut constitutes the Tree (foundations) of Good and Evil: if one is worthy, %0a> she becomes good for him and purifies him, if not— she turns evil. Accordingly, %0a> the rule of night is also divided into two parts: the first refers to a state called %0a> "unworthy— evil," and the second refers to a state called "worthy— good." %0a> %0a> The first correction of Malchut's good part is made exactly at midnight (in a %0a> state so called "midnight"), for it is then that Malchut receives the voice of Bina. %0a> Put differently, Malchut ascends to Malchut de Ima-Bina and corrects herself %0a> within it. As a result, the strictness and judgment in Malchut become holy and %0a> good, completely devoid of evil. This means that strictness and judgment fall %0a> onto the impure forces, but for Israel, they turn into mercy. %0a> %0a> Yitzchak signifies restriction, the property of Malchut within Bina. The %0a> Hebrew word for a "rooster" is Tarnegol, and also Gever (man) and designates %0a> the angel Gavriel, who attends to Malchut, the lesser star. The strictness of Bina %0a> pierces the wings of the rooster (Gavriel), and through it Malchut receives the %0a> voice of Bina. %0a> %0a> And when Gavriel passes the voice of Bina to Malchut, his call reaches all %0a> the roosters of this world, the property of judgment in the spiritual void. Such %0a> a state is called "this world" or Malchut de Malchut. Everyone speaks only in this %0a> voice, which was corrected by Bina's property of mercy. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the voice of Malchut (her judgment) no longer dominates the %0a> second half of the night, and the voice of Bina claims this place. This is what the %0a> "rooster of this world" heralds— the property of judgment in Malchut de Malchut. %0a> %0a> Hence, a rooster's crow (change of properties) is heard precisely at midnight %0a> (when states change), for this crow means that Malchut has already been corrected %0a> by the voice of Bina, and that this voice is already within Malchut. This is defined %0a> as the moment of midnight, which marks the beginning of the second half- %0a> absolute goodness, devoid of evil. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Who Is This? %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 353 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> After Malchut receives the voice of Bina, the righteous (man's properties in %0a> the worlds of BYA) raise MAN with the help of their study of To rah after (in the %0a> state of) midnight. They keep raising MAN to the "cheerful strictness" in Ima, of %0a> which it is written: "She rises also while it is yet night" (Mishley, 31:15), for it is %0a> precisely at night that the Supernal Malchut reveals herself in all her splendor. %0a> %0a> And the actual revelation of Malchut takes place in the Garden of Eden, i.e., %0a> she is meant for those righteous who have corrected her with their work and %0a> studies (in the state) after midnight. The Creator rejoices with them (merriment %0a> signifies fulfillment with Ohr Hochma) in the Garden of Eden, for the corrected %0a> Malchut is called "the Holy Shechina" or "the Garden of Eden," for she receives %0a> Hochma and rejoices with the righteous that constitute MAN within her. %0a> %0a> And the phrase that describes how impurity (egoistic desires) is washed away %0a> (corrected to altruistic properties) from man's fingers (his most exalted desires) %0a> is true not only with regard to nighttime. Man ascends from the lower degree %0a> of "sleep" onto a higher degree of "awakening," the difference between the two %0a> states being that previously, he was receiving only the vital Ohr Hassadim, called %0a> "sleep," while "awakening" signifies reception of Ohr Hochma. This is because %0a> the impure force constantly clings to man's fingertips (precisely for man to %0a> correct it and thus attain greater spiritual heights), and he is obliged to wash his %0a> hands (make his desires and intentions "for the Creator's sake") before uttering %0a> a blessing (appealing to the Creator for reception). %0a> %0a> 172. For when man is asleep, his soul (spirit) leaves him. And as soon as his soul %0a> departs from him, the impure spirit replaces it at once, and it fills his hands %0a> and defiles them, and it is forbidden to utter a blessing without washing one's %0a> hands. And should you object that when man is awake and his soul does not %0a> leave him, the impure force does not descend upon him, then, if he enters a %0a> washroom, he is forbidden from reading even a single word of the Torah until %0a> he washes his hands. And if you say that it is because his hands are soiled, this %0a> is not true, for how are they soiled? %0a> %0a> 173. But woe unto those who do not beware and do not guard the Creator's %0a> honor and do not know the foundation of this world. There is a certain spirit %0a> that dwells in every cesspool of the world, a spirit that relishes depravity and %0a> excrement, and it immediately settles on the fingers of man's hands. %0a> %0a> Just like Rabbi Y. Ashlag, I refrain from commenting on items 172 and 173 %0a> of The Zohar, and he who merits it— will understand this text himself. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 174. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "He who rejoices on holidays and does %0a> not give a part to the Creator, the evil eye hates and slanders him, removes %0a> him from this world, and brings him many miseries." %0a> %0a> We have already said (item 68) that the impure forces (egoistic spiritual %0a> forces within man that know of and hence desire the pleasures hidden in the %0a> Creator's Light) consist of male and female parts. The male part brings less harm %0a> than the female. It leads man to transgressions such as lying in the name of the %0a> Creator, as though it inspires man to observe the Mitzvot, but not in complete %0a> purity (with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator). Instead, it causes man %0a> to also add a touch of personal benefit and selfish enjoyment, as it is written: %0a> "Eat not the bread of an ill-willer, nor desire his treats; for as one reckons within %0a> himself, such is he: 'Eat and drink,' he shall say to you; but his heart is not with %0a> you" (Mishley, 23:6-7). %0a> %0a> Since the male impure force has absolutely no intentions to bestow, the %0a> commandment remains devoid of fear and love (without a heart). Yet, since the %0a> male impure force has already caught man in its net, it gains power to make a %0a> Zivug with its female half (the impure Nukva), which is a bitter and evil impure %0a> force that lies in the name of the Creator, and, upon seducing man, captures %0a> his entire soul. %0a> %0a> Hence, The Zohar says that the evil eye hates and slanders man, and removes %0a> him from this world by provoking him to fail to observe the commandment of %0a> rejoicing on a holiday (the reception of Ohr Hochma, joy on a higher degree)— so %0a> that this joy would not be for the sake of the Creator. It is as though he eats %0a> alone and does not share his food with the needy, which leads to the male %0a> impure force making a Zivug with Nukva and capturing man's soul. %0a> %0a> 355 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 356 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 175. The Creator's role is to cheer the poor, according to His ability. For the %0a> Creator appears on the holidays so as to look at His broken Kelim. He comes %0a> to them, and He sees that there is nothing to rejoice in, and He weeps for %0a> them, and ascends Above to destroy the world. %0a> %0a> To understand this passage and the angels' objections, one must first %0a> understand the words of the sages (Midrash Raba, 86): "When creating the world, %0a> the Creator asked the angels: 'Shall we create man in our image (T^elem) and %0a> likeness?' And the four angels (forces, properties) of creation gave their answers: %0a> %0a> Mercy said, LET US CREATE, for he creates Hassadim, mercy. Truth %0a> said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he is all falsehood. Justice said, LET US %0a> CREATE, for he dispenses justice. Peace said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he %0a> is all enmity." %0a> %0a> What did the Creator do? He took truth and concealed it in the ground, as %0a> it is written: "cast down truth to the ground" (Daniel, 8: 12). Our entire purpose %0a> in the study of the Torah and Mitzvot lies in that, thanks to them, as the Talmud %0a> says (Psachim, 50, 2): "From Lo Lishma (intentions for oneself) man comes to %0a> Lishma (intentions for the Creator's sake)." %0a> %0a> And since man is born with such insignificant desires and powers, he is %0a> unable to immediately engage in the Creator's Mitzvot for the sake of pleasing %0a> the Giver of these Mitzvot, for as it is said: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" (lyov, %0a> 11:12). Due to his egoistic nature, he is unable to make any inner movement or %0a> action if it is not for his own benefit. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Creator allows man to begin observing the Mitzvot solely for %0a> his own sake, seeking personal benefit. Yet, in spite of this, his actions attract %0a> spiritual Light to him. And then, with the help of the received Light, he comes %0a> to observe the Mitzvot for the Creator's sake, in order to please Him. %0a> %0a> This is exactly what Truth presented when it objected to man's creation %0a> and said that he is all falsehood. After all, how can man be created to study the %0a> Torah and observe Mitzvot in a state of absolute falsehood, i.e., "for oneself?" %0a> %0a> However, Mercy said, "Let us create," for man performs merciful deeds. %0a> Although the Mitzvot of mercy, which man observes (even if mechanically) initially %0a> "for his own sake," are mere external actions without the intention of bestowal, %0a> with their help he gradually corrects his intentions until he becomes capable of %0a> observing all the Mitzvot "for the Creator's sake." Hence, there exists an absolute %0a> certainty and guarantee that through his efforts, man will achieve the goal- %0a> altruistic actions "for the Creator's sake." And that it is okay to create man. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 357 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Peace also asserted that man is all "enmity;" hence, he can observe the Mitzvot %0a> "for the Creator's sake" only if it also brings him personal benefit. However, due %0a> to such mixed intentions and actions, man exists in constant conflict with the %0a> Creator, for it seems to him that he is great and righteous, and he utterly fails to %0a> see his shortcomings. In other words, he is completely unaware that all his work %0a> in the Torah and Mitzvot is exclusively for his own benefit. %0a> %0a> And because he feels this way, he fills up with anger and resentment towards %0a> the Creator: why does the Creator not treat him as it befits one so perfectly %0a> righteous? It follows that he alternates between states of peace and conflict with %0a> the Creator. That is why Peace objected to the creation of man. %0a> %0a> However, Justice said that man should be created, for he dispenses justice. %0a> By observing the Mitzva (singular for Mitzvot) of giving charity to the poor, even %0a> with the intention "for oneself," he gradually acquires the property of "bestowal," %0a> learns to act "for the Creator's sake," and merits eternal peace with Him. %0a> %0a> After the Creator heard these opinions, He agreed with the angels of %0a> Mercy and Justice, and cast down Truth to the "ground." By this, He allowed %0a> man to begin observing the Mitzvot with the intention "for oneself," despite %0a> its falsehood. %0a> %0a> It follows that the Creator cast Truth down to the ground because He had %0a> accepted the claims of Mercy and Justice, that thanks to the Mitzva of giving %0a> charity to the poor, man will ultimately come to Truth, i.e., work for the Creator's %0a> sake, and Truth will rise from the ground. %0a> %0a> The only creation created by the Creator is Malchut de Malchut, egoism, %0a> and it can only be corrected by "instilling" the Creator's properties of Bina %0a> or mercy into it. Yet, if these properties are opposite, how can such a thing be %0a> accomplished? After all, in the spiritual world, distance is proportionate to the %0a> difference in properties. So how can Malchut be united with Bina? %0a> %0a> To this end, the Kli was broken: the spiritual, altruistic desire lost its screen %0a> and became egoistic. Yet, it retained sparks of the Light, and these sparks exist %0a> within egoistic desires. This is why egoistic desires have power over us. %0a> %0a> These sparks of the Upper Light are the source of various pleasures and love, %0a> for Light is pleasure. And since these particles of Light are clothed in impure %0a> garments and exist under the rule of the impure forces, man starts perceiving %0a> these feelings of love and delight as being inherent in the impure forces, as %0a> though these egoistic garments contain pleasures, and such is their property. %0a> And he associates the properties of love and pleasure with the impure forces, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 358 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> failing to understand that the impure forces draw him solely with the spiritual %0a> spark that has fallen into them. %0a> %0a> However, as the impure force is very appealing, it lures man into all kinds %0a> of transgressions, such as theft, robbery, and murder. At the same time, it gives %0a> us the desire to observe the Torah and Mitzvot for our own sake. Even if we start %0a> observing them not "for the Creator's sake," but "for ourselves," (for our own %0a> benefit, to fulfill our base aspirations, according to the desires of the broken, %0a> egoistic JCelim-vessels), we gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's %0a> sake," and merit the goal of creation— to receive all the pleasure that was prepared %0a> for us back in the Thought of Creation— "to delight man." Thus, the impure %0a> forces destroy themselves, but that is exactly the purpose for which the Creator %0a> conceived and created them. %0a> %0a> The Zohar says that the Creator appears on these holidays to look at all the %0a> broken Kelim. On holidays, when man observes the Mitzva of rejoicing because %0a> of the great Light that he receives from the Creator, the Creator appears to look %0a> at His broken vessels, by which man is given an opportunity to observe the %0a> Mitzvot not "for the Creator's sake." The Creator comes and looks at how well %0a> these broken vessels have fulfilled their mission to bring man to observance of %0a> the Mitzvot with the intention "for the Creator's sake." %0a> %0a> However, the Creator comes to them and sees that there is nothing to rejoice %0a> in. He weeps over them, for He sees that nothing spiritual (altruistic) was created %0a> from the broken vessels, that man has yet to correct even a single broken vessel %0a> (egoistic desire). In other words, there's not one vessel that was intentionally %0a> broken by the Creator that has brought man to the intention "for the Creator's %0a> sake," and he rejoices on holidays solely for his own pleasure. %0a> %0a> So the Creator weeps and regrets breaking the vessels, for He broke them %0a> and cast Truth to the ground only for man's sake, to give him an opportunity to %0a> start working in falsehood (in the intention "for oneself) and gradually come %0a> to Truth, to the intention "for the Creator's sake." Yet, when He sees that man %0a> has not changed at all in his aspirations for selfish pleasure, it is as though the %0a> vessels were broken in vain, and so He weeps for them. %0a> %0a> And He rises Above, to destroy the world— meaning, He ascends so as to stop %0a> the Light's descent and thereby destroy the world. The world and creatures can %0a> exist only if they receive the Creator's Light (even if unconsciously). However, %0a> if man's state and selfish actions cannot lead him to the intention "for the %0a> Creator's sake," the Light itself becomes detrimental to him, for in pursuit of this %0a> Light, man sinks ever deeper into egoistic desires (impure forces) and growing %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 359 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> dependency on egoism. Therefore, it is more desirable and beneficial for man %0a> to stop feeling pleasure in his impure desires, so that it would not destroy him %0a> completely and prevent him from sinking into such powerful egoistic desires %0a> that, having become a slave to their pleasures, he would never be able escape %0a> them and attain the spiritual. %0a> %0a> 176. The members of the assembly then appear before the Creator and say: %0a> "Master of the world, You are called merciful and forgiving, send Your mercy %0a> upon Your sons." He answers them: "Have I not done so, when I created the %0a> world based on mercy? As it is written, 'The world is built by mercy' and the %0a> world is established upon it. However, if they do not show mercy to the poor, %0a> the world will be destroyed." The Heavenly angels then say to Him: "Master %0a> of the world, here is a man who had eaten and drunk to his heart's content, %0a> and could have been merciful to the poor, but did not do anything." The %0a> prosecutor appears, receives permission, and persecutes that man. %0a> %0a> The exalted souls, called "the members (or the sons) of the assembly" begin %0a> praying for the lower ones, so the Creator would have mercy on His sons and %0a> not discontinue the flow of Light descending onto them. They do everything %0a> within their power to justify man's state of being, and say that as long as he %0a> observes his Mitzvot in faith, he is called "the Creator's son," and hence deserves %0a> the Creator's mercy, as a son deserves the mercy of his father. %0a> %0a> The Creator replies to them that He created the world by the property of %0a> mercy, and the world stands on this property alone. In other words, man will %0a> not be corrected by the Creator's Light as long as he disdains the poor, for the %0a> world's creation was the result of the Creator's agreement with the angel of %0a> Mercy, which states that due to man's merciful deeds, the world will be able to %0a> exist and will gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's sake." But now, %0a> since people are not showing mercy, there will be no correction. %0a> %0a> Then the Supernal angels said, "Master of the universe, here is a man who %0a> had eaten and drunk, and had his fill, and could have been merciful to the poor, %0a> but did not give them anything." In this case, the angels begin to accuse man, %0a> instead of defending him, even the angels of Mercy and Justice. And all those %0a> who did not wish to create an egoistic man with desires "for oneself," but agreed %0a> to it only because they assumed that by deeds of mercy and justice he would %0a> escape his egoism "for one's own sake" and achieve the altruistic property "for %0a> the Creator's sake." Now, they, too, turn against man. %0a> %0a> And if man is unable to acquire the intention "for the Creator's sake," the %0a> angels repent and regret at having agreed to his creation, and they now accuse %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 360 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> him before the Creator. And after it becomes clear that man will not achieve the %0a> altruistic property "for the Creator's sake" by observing the Mitzvot, he is passed %0a> into the hands of the prosecutor. %0a> %0a> 177. There are none greater in our world than Avraham, who acted with mercy %0a> toward all creatures. It is written of the day that he prepared a feast: "The child %0a> grew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak %0a> was weaned." So Avraham prepared a feast and invited all the leaders of that %0a> generation. It is well known that at every feast, the supreme prosecutor is about, %0a> watching. And if there are any poor people in the house, he leaves that house %0a> and does not return there. However, if the prosecutor enters a house and sees %0a> rejoicing without the poor— without having first shown mercy to the poor— he %0a> ascends Above and brings accusations against the host of that feast. %0a> %0a> 178. Because Avraham was the leader of his generation, the prosecutor %0a> descended from Heavens and stood at the door of his house, disguised as a %0a> poor man. And nobody so much as looked at him. Avraham was attending %0a> to kings and ministers, and Sarah was feeding all of their children, for they %0a> did not believe that she had born a child, but rather claimed that Yitzchak %0a> was a foundling, whom they had bought at the marketplace. This is why they %0a> brought their children with them, and Sarah nursed them in front of all. And %0a> the prosecutor stands at the door. Sarah said: "The Creator has made laughter %0a> for me" ("For anyone who hears will laugh on account of me" (Beresheet, %0a> 21:6). The prosecutor ascended at once and stood before the Creator, and said %0a> to Him, "O Master of the world, You have said that You love Avraham, and %0a> here he had prepared a feast, but had not given anything to You nor to the %0a> poor, had not sacrificed even a single pigeon for Your sake. And Sarah says %0a> that You have laughed at her." %0a> %0a> Until the end of correction, it is impossible to fully rid oneself of the impure %0a> forces. Hence, however hard even the most exalted righteous may try to observe %0a> the Creator's Mitzvot in purity of their altruistic intentions, without any touch %0a> of personal benefit, the impure forces can nonetheless accuse them and find %0a> faults in their observance of the Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Creator prepared another opportunity for the righteous to %0a> silence the prosecutor— by bribing him with a certain portion of holiness and %0a> purity, thus silencing him. This way, the prosecutor is reluctant to accuse a %0a> righteous one and does not want him to disappear, for then the prosecutor, %0a> too, will be deprived of his part of holiness, the Light that he receives as the %0a> righteous one observes each Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 361 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, the need for external hair in Tefillin (phylacteries), scapegoat rite, red %0a> heifer, and so forth. (The Zohar, Emor, p. 88). From this we see how extraordinary, %0a> multifaceted, and complex this world is created, how impossible it is to judge %0a> human deeds and the Upper Governance by external manifestations, as they are %0a> seen by us, and how "entangled" and inseparably intertwined all the connections %0a> between the pure and impure forces really are. %0a> %0a> Even when we look at our great leaders-Kabbalists, we see how much they've %0a> suffered, how they were forced to submit to the will of petty rulers or ignorant %0a> masses, and how persecuted they were— those who were closest to the Creator! %0a> Everyone feels these obstacles, even those who are just beginning on their %0a> spiritual journey. %0a> %0a> But here, in the example of Avraham, The Zohar does not speak about an %0a> ordinary prosecutor, for Avraham had surely given food to all the poor, as he %0a> had always done even before he invited his distinguished guests to his table. But %0a> this prosecutor demanded his share of holiness, of the Light. However, Avraham %0a> did not wish to give anything of holiness to impurity. Rather, he wanted to %0a> overcome its power and push it away from himself completely. This is why the %0a> prosecutor ascended Above and accused Avraham. %0a> %0a> The Zohar tells us that the prosecutor was not really poor, but only disguised %0a> himself as such, and demanded to be treated at Avraham's festive table. Avraham %0a> felt that this was an impure force that assumed the image of a poor man; hence, %0a> he refused to give it anything. %0a> %0a> This is why it is written: "He did not sacrifice even a single pigeon," for %0a> in accordance to the sacrificial rites (rejection of egoistic parts, of man's "I"), %0a> only two pigeons are offered, which symbolize the two combined points in %0a> Malchut: the property of Malchut that was corrected by the property of mercy, %0a> Bina. This common point contains both the properties of restriction and %0a> mercy, but the property of restriction is concealed, whereas the property of %0a> mercy is revealed (item 122). %0a> %0a> Without this combination of Malchut's properties with those of Bina, %0a> called the "mitigation" or "sweetening" of Malchut, the world (Malchut) %0a> cannot exist, i.e., receive the Creator's Light. Therefore, it is necessary to %0a> offer precisely two baby pigeons. One of them was sent by Noah from his %0a> Ark, never to return (Beresheet, 8), for one pigeon designates the property of %0a> restriction in Malchut that is unmitigated by Bina's property of mercy. And %0a> since Noah could not correct anything in her, the pigeon never returned to %0a> him (The Zohar Shlach, p. 52). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 362 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The prosecutor's claims and complaints concerning Avraham's feast on the %0a> day when Yitzchak was weaned stem from his demand to receive his share, the %0a> corrections of the part of Malchut that cannot be corrected until Gmar Tikkun %0a> (the end of correction). And this is the property of the restriction within Malchut, %0a> with which the world cannot exist; hence, it must be concealed. This property is %0a> the pigeon that did not return to Noah. %0a> %0a> Man was not entrusted with the task of correcting his Creator-given %0a> primordial egoism, for it is impossible to alter what the Creator had made. %0a> However, man can hide his Malchut, his egoism (refrain from using it), and %0a> instead act by receiving his desires from Bina. This is why a combination of %0a> the properties of Malchut (egoism) and Bina (altruism) was formed in man— to %0a> let him make the effort and conceal the properties of Malchut, and act only %0a> according to the properties of Bina. %0a> %0a> When one is able to completely reject the use of his egoism and is guided %0a> only by the properties of Bina, he will achieve a state called "the end of his %0a> :tion." Correction is made during the 6,000 years, i.e., along the degre %0a> %0a> Then, man's Mashiach (Messiah/savior), the Upper Light, comes to him %0a> and transforms all of man's egoism (the primordial nature that he was rejecting %0a> during the 6,000 years) into altruism. Then, one's egoistic properties serve for %0a> the reception of the Light of pleasure for the Creator's sake, and he no longer %0a> needs to refrain from using them. %0a> %0a> The property of Malchut, with which man cannot work for the Creator's %0a> sake until his final correction, is referred to as "restriction." Using the properties %0a> of Malchut herself remains forbidden until she is completely corrected through %0a> gradual purification by the properties of Bina during the 6,000 years. Alternatively, %0a> Malchut is called "strictness" or "judgment," for this restriction is also the source %0a> of all punishments and prohibitions. %0a> %0a> Avraham could not correct this property of restriction in Malchut, i.e., %0a> receive the Light and fill Malchut entirely. Hence, he received nothing in this %0a> part, and that is exactly the way he treated the prosecutor, who ascended at %0a> once and began to accuse Avraham before the Creator, claiming that Avraham %0a> failed to correct anything in Malchut's property of restriction with his feast. This %0a> property of restriction is called "poor," for it does not receive Light; hence, it %0a> constitutes the essence of Malchut, her egoism. %0a> %0a> Since the Creator mitigated the restrictive property of Malchut with the %0a> property of mercy, and mixed Malchut with Bina for the sole purpose of giving the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 363 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> world an opportunity to exist, the Light that is received thanks to the property %0a> of mercy is defined as the part of Light belonging to all the world's inhabitants. %0a> This part helps Malchut become corrected. Since the Creator created Malchut in %0a> order to personally fill her with Light, she is regarded as His personal part. %0a> %0a> As a result of a miracle of nursing the babies that were brought to Sarah, %0a> Avraham received all the Light that exists in the property of mercy, and began to %0a> doubt his ability to correct the poor part of Malchut. This part receives nothing %0a> (for it cannot be used during the 6,000 years) and constitutes the Creator's %0a> personal part. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the prosecutor ascended, accusing Avraham of not giving to the %0a> poor, i.e., not giving to the part of the Creator, Malchut de Malchut herself, %0a> which no man can correct by himself, as even Noah was unable to do so. And %0a> he gave nothing to You nor to the poor, and sacrificed not even a single pigeon %0a> for Your sake. %0a> %0a> And Sarah says that You have laughed at her. Sarah is the part of Bina %0a> that shines in Malchut. With the words: "Any who hears will laugh on account %0a> of me" (Beresheet, 21:6), Sarah-Bina gave Malchut such powerful Ohr Hassadim %0a> that Malchut stopped feeling her egoistic desires, felt the perfection of altruism, %0a> and temporarily acquired the properties of Bina, while under the influence of %0a> Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> However, there emerges fear that due to such a sense of perfection and %0a> absence of suffering from unfulfilled desires, the absence of the feeling of %0a> deficiency, Malchut would remain uncorrected. Such a state is similar to the %0a> following description of Adam's state in the Torah (Beresheet, 3:22): "Lest he %0a> put forth his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever." %0a> In other words, he must not stop feeling his own nature nor forget the fact %0a> that he is obliged to correct his defect in the "Tree of Knowledge." And that is %0a> why Adam was cast down into a place that is suitable for correction, the lowest %0a> possible egoistic place, called our world. %0a> %0a> 179. The Creator said to him: "Who in the world is like Avraham?" And the %0a> prosecutor did not leave from there until he had consumed the entire fare. So %0a> the Creator decreed that Yitzchak is to be sacrificed. And He said that Sarah %0a> shall die from grief for her son. The cause of this grief is that he did not give %0a> anything to the poor. %0a> %0a> Yitzchak's sacrifice was aimed at the correction of Malchut, to compensate %0a> for what Avraham could not correct at his great feast in honor of Yitzchak's %0a> weaning. Sarah's death was the result of the great Light that she passed to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 364 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut, saying: "The Creator has made laughter for me," alluding to the Light %0a> that obstructs the correction of Malchut. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Light that descends to Malchut and gives her the sensation of %0a> perfection prevents her from correcting herself. Hence, the Creator stopped it. %0a> This is the significance of Sarah's death, for Sarah constitutes the Light of Bina %0a> that enters Malchut. Thus, all that the Torah speaks of is but the essence of the %0a> process of Malchut's correction, until her correction is completed. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah and Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 180. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "It is written that Hizkiyahu (Hezekiah) %0a> turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Creator." Let us see how great %0a> and potent the power of the Torah is, and how high it rises above all. He %0a> who engages in the Torah has no fear of those Above or below, nor of any %0a> hardships or illnesses of this world, for he is connected to the Tree of Life and %0a> learns from it each day. %0a> %0a> 181. For the Torah teaches man how to walk a path of truth; it teaches him %0a> how to return to his Master and cancel what is predestined for him. And %0a> even if man is shown that what is predestined for him cannot be cancelled, %0a> it is nonetheless completely cancelled and annulled, then disappears at once %0a> and does not prevail over him in this world. Hence, man should study the %0a> Torah day and night, and never abandon it, as it is written: "Contemplate %0a> Him day and night." Whomever abandons the Torah, it is as though he %0a> abandons the Tree of Life. %0a> %0a> "Contemplate Him day and night"— "Him" implies the Creator! In another %0a> place in The Zohar, it is said that Hizkiyahu's prayer was accepted by the Creator, %0a> for nothing (no egoistic desires) separated him from the wall (the Shechina, the %0a> sensation of the Creator, akin to the Wailing Wall). %0a> %0a> This was the advice that he received from the Torah, when, through his %0a> efforts in the Torah, he realized how to achieve complete return to the Creator, %0a> whereby nothing would separate him from the Creator (from the wall, the %0a> Shechina, the sensation of the Creator). As a result, the decree of his death (the %0a> Light's exit from the Partzuf) was revoked. So great is the power of the Torah. %0a> %0a> 182. Come and see— such is the advice given to man. When he goes to bed at %0a> night, he must accept the Creator's governance from Above, and wholeheartedly %0a> %0a> 365 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 366 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> entrust his soul with Him. Thus, man is immediately spared all the illnesses, %0a> slander, and evil eyes, and they will no longer have power over him. %0a> %0a> Here we come to a precise understanding of certain definitions from the %0a> Torah, which are quite different from the notions that we are accustomed to. %0a> Daylight signifies the sensation of unity with the Creator. It is called "Light," for %0a> this is how man defines his good feelings. Therefore, daylight is when man feels %0a> closeness of the Creator and the greatness of spirituality. %0a> %0a> Darkness coincides with nighttime in our world. Accordingly, with regard %0a> to man's spiritual states, darkness designates the absence of the sensation of the %0a> Creator, of the Upper Light, due to the actions of the impure, egoistic forces that %0a> separate man from the Creator. At night in our world, we sleep. The spiritual %0a> Partzuf is filled with the minimal amount of Light in an unconscious state called %0a> "sleep." The amount of Light within the Partzuf is so little that it is defined as %0a> one sixtieth— 6 (Sefirot of ZA) x 10 (in each part)— of death or complete absence %0a> of spiritual Light, for the impure forces rule here. %0a> %0a> Due to these two forces that govern and control us, we cannot completely %0a> and permanently merge with the Creator. As the result of our sensation of the %0a> state of night, the impure forces that rule at night impede us in our efforts, for %0a> their power over us keeps returning, thus creating gaps in our unity with the %0a> Creator and in our work for His sake. %0a> %0a> To correct this, Rabbi Shimon gives us his advice: every "night" (a feeling %0a> of separation from the spiritual), when man goes to "sleep" (sinks deeper into %0a> the sensations of this world), he must wholeheartedly accept the Creator's %0a> governance, entrust himself completely under His rule. For if the night (the %0a> sensation of night) is corrected as in the act of creation, when day follows night, %0a> as it is said, "And there was evening and there was morning, one day," both %0a> night and day become as a single whole. %0a> %0a> And the night, called "the rule of Malchut," shall not mix with any impure %0a> force, and shall not attack man because of the disappearance of the sensation of %0a> the Creator on account of egoistic desires and obstacles of "reason." For first, %0a> man has realized the necessity of the night for the attainment of the next day %0a> (greater sensation of the Creator, a bigger altruistic desire), and perceives these %0a> two states as a single whole and as an advancement, despite the fact that in his %0a> sensations, a night designates remoteness from spirituality. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> from the Creator, and is therefore without joy, despite all the possible pleasures, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> e language of spiritual work, this means that if man feels remi %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> for him thi %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> is called "night." I %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> sely %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah and Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 367 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> absence of sensation and lack of faith in the Creator that man can, through his %0a> own effort, without feeling any taste in the Torah, yield before the Creator's rule. %0a> That is, he closes his eyes (as one who goes to sleep) and says: "I bring myself %0a> under the Creator's rule and submit to His will." This state is called "descent %0a> for the sake of a subsequent ascent," and serves as a springboard, by which man %0a> attains an even brighter "day." %0a> %0a> However, to this end man must completely accept the Supernal Kingdom's %0a> rule, so that nothing will separate him from the Creator. In other words, he %0a> must submit to the Supernal Rule unconditionally, whether it brings life or %0a> death, so that no force in the world will be able to stop him from uniting with %0a> the Supernal Ruler, as it is written, "Love your Creator with all your heart, with %0a> all your soul and with all your might" (Devarim, 6:5). %0a> %0a> If man accepts everything that the Creator sends him with all his heart, he %0a> is certain that nothing will separate him from the Creator. This determines the %0a> fulfillment of the condition of entrusting one's soul with the Creator. For he %0a> gives himself into the Creator's hands in advance, by deciding to fulfill all His %0a> desires (commandments) to the fullest, right up to self-sacrifice. %0a> %0a> Hence, as man sleeps, when his soul (the sensation of the Creator), the %0a> *ht that previously filled him, leaves his body (desires), he does not feel the %0a> th part of death, for the impure (egoistic) forces have no power %0a> ;r words, they do not separate him from the Creator. Rather, %0a> Is to feel the Creator temporarily. %0a> %0a> Thus, the impure forces cannot interrupt his spiritual work even in the state %0a> called "night," for his evening and morning are already as one day— the Creator's %0a> Light. The night becomes a part of the day, for it is precisely because of the night %0a> that he recognizes his future merit of receiving an even greater Light. %0a> %0a> This is because his night stems not from the rule of the impure forces. %0a> Instead, he understands that the Creator intentionally sends him such states, %0a> hus, even in such sensations as darkness and lack of feeling, absence %0a> and taste for the spiritual, he sees an opportunity to merge witl %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 183. And in the morning, when he rises from his bed, he must bless the %0a> Creator, enter His house, and bow before Him in fear and trepidation, and %0a> only then should he pray. He should take advice of his holy Patriarchs, as it is %0a> written, "By Your great mercy shall I come into Your house, to bow in fear of %0a> Your holy greatness." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 368 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Thanks to Your great kindness, I can now bless You for being merciful to %0a> me, for ending my spiritual descent, and for letting me come into Your house %0a> once more, for allowing me to feel You. However, I am happy not because my %0a> suffering gave way to pleasure, but because now I can thank You. I come to Your %0a> house so as to kneel in awe before Your holy greatness, which I now attain more %0a> than ever before. %0a> %0a> The prayer in our heart is the correction within Malchut (the Shechina, the %0a> sensation of the Creator, or the common soul of Israel), and the fulfillment %0a> of this common soul with the Upper Light (the sensation of the Creator), in %0a> accordance with all of its corrected desires. Hence, all our pleas are expressed %0a> in plural form, for we pray not for our own soul, but for the common soul of %0a> Israel. Naturally, all that is present in the Shechina is subsequently present in %0a> every soul of Israel, and vice versa, all that the common soul of Israel lacks is %0a> also absent in each soul. %0a> %0a> Therefore, before we start praying, we need to understand (feel) what is %0a> lacking in Malchut (the Shechina), to know what we need to correct in her and %0a> how we can fulfill her. Our heart, the center of our desires, is a part of this %0a> Malchut (the Shechina). All the generations of Israel are included in the common %0a> soul— the Shechina. However, we need not correct what has already been corrected %0a> by previous generations, but only what is left after those generations of souls. %0a> %0a> Our Patriarchs, the spiritual Partzufim called "Avraham, Yitzchakand Yaakov," %0a> also known as the Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet of Partzuf ZA de Atzilut, %0a> include the entire community of Israel, all the properties that subsequently %0a> manifest in the corrected Malchut, who, in her corrected state, is called "Israel." %0a> The Patriarchs designate the three spiritual roots of the 600,000 souls of Israel %0a> in all the generations. In other words, these are the three sources of desires born %0a> within man's part of Malchut for the purpose of his correction. %0a> %0a> All the good deeds, the reception and bestowal of Light carried out by %0a> the "community of Israel" (by Kabbalists) in all the generations, first trigger %0a> reception of the Upper Light by our holy Patriarchs (Sefirot de ZA), for all the %0a> Upper Light descends through them from Above downwards. From them, this %0a> Upper Light descends onto the "community of Israel," the righteous of that %0a> generation who exist with their properties in the worlds of BYA, and evoke the %0a> descent of this Light with their prayers. %0a> %0a> Such is the order of spiritual degrees: each branch can receive only through %0a> its root (the preceding, Higher Degree), but never independently. The main %0a> Light remains in the root, and only an insignificant part of it descends to the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah and Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 369 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> branch that evokes it. Therefore, all the corrections completed in the community %0a> of Israel (the Shechina, the common soul) are stored and preserved in the souls %0a> of our holy Patriarchs. %0a> %0a> (The Light received in the corrected Kelim remains forever within them. %0a> Our description of the Light's exit and descent should be understood as a %0a> metaphor, for the Partzuf receives new empty desires that require correction, and %0a> the sensation of emptiness from the received empty desires is perceived as the %0a> Light's departure. Nevertheless, upon correcting these newly received desires, in %0a> them the Partzuf will receive an even greater Light than before). %0a> %0a> Therefore, the essence of our prayer lies in supplementing the Shechina with %0a> whatever it needs to achieve complete correction, after all the previous corrections %0a> that were performed in it by the past generations of Kabbalists. Hence, he who %0a> spiritually ascends must first make all the corrections that have already been %0a> performed in the Shechina, and only then will he be able to recognize what is left %0a> for him to correct. %0a> %0a> This is why it is written that one cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, %0a> but in Hebrew it means "the house of assembly" or "the house of prayer," from %0a> the word Kones— "to assemble") before he assembles his prayer and asks the holy %0a> Patriarchs for guidance, for he needs to know what has already been corrected %0a> and what still needs to be corrected. This is possible only after he receives %0a> everything that the Patriarchs have corrected through the Shechina. Only then %0a> will he come to know what is left for him to correct in the Shechina. %0a> %0a> The Patriarchs have corrected the prayer in the Shechina. Prayer and the %0a> Shechina are one and the same, for prayer is a request, a raising of MAN, a Kli, the %0a> corrected Malchut or the desire for the Creator's sake. The correction performed %0a> by Avraham is called Shacharit (the morning prayer), by Yitzchak— Mincha (the %0a> afternoon prayer), and by Yaakov— Arvit (the evening prayer). Therefore, one %0a> must first repeat in his prayer everything that was already corrected by them, %0a> and then he will discover how to construct his personal plea, and what other %0a> imperfections are left that only he can, and consequently, must correct. %0a> %0a> 184. Man cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, house of prayer) unless %0a> he first receives permission from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, for they %0a> have corrected the prayer to the Creator. It is therefore written, "And in Your %0a> great mercy shall I enter into Your house" (Tehilim, 5:8). The aforesaid refers %0a> to Avraham, for his property is mercy, the Sefira Hesed. "I will bow before %0a> Your holy chamber" refers to Yitzchak, for thanks to him Malchut is called %0a> Heichal— chamber, the Sefira Qevura. "In fear and trepidation" refers to %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 370 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yaakov, for his property is the Sefira Tifferet, called "fear." And man must %0a> first enter into these properties, and only then enter the Beit Knesset to raise %0a> his prayers. Such a state is described by the verse, "Here is My slave, Israel, by %0a> whom I am adorned." %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar analyzes the first three main corrections, made by the %0a> Patriarchs in the Shechina. Avraham corrected the property called Bait (house, %0a> permanent dwelling), which allows man to merge with it and to always exist in %0a> the Creator's properties and sensations, just as he can always dwell in his house. %0a> %0a> Yitzchak complemented the correction and corrected Maichut in the %0a> property called the "holy temple," so that the King Himself would always dwell %0a> in it, as a king always dwells in his chambers. Yaakov added to the correction %0a> by the property of fear, which corresponds to a gate in front of a house, and %0a> designates the condition that (if met) allows man to enter Maichut, Avraham's %0a> house, and into Yitzchak's holy temple that are both within her. %0a> %0a> Upon including within him all three corrections of the Patriarchs in full %0a> perfection, he attains what has already been corrected in the holy Shechina, and %0a> then proceeds to correct what has not been corrected. %0a> %0a> Avraham is the source of the property of mercy in the souls of Israel. %0a> Therefore, he corrected the holy Shechina in such a way that it could receive %0a> Ohr Hassadim, the Light of Mercy. And the Shechina received this Light in its %0a> entirety for all the souls of Israel. Had it remained this way, all the souls of %0a> Israel would have been in complete and eternal unity with the Creator, and %0a> the Shechina would have been filled with Light (pleasure). Thus, no man would %0a> ever wish to part with the Shechina (the sensation of the Creator) even for a %0a> single moment. %0a> %0a> Yet, Avraham's entire correction consisted in the creation of a perfect, %0a> bestowing Kli, which consisted only of Ohr Hassadim. There was no way of %0a> corrupting its properties or introducing imperfection within it, for, just like %0a> Avraham's property of mercy (Hesed), this Kli (desire) consisted only of the will %0a> to bestow upon, and please the Creator, as it is written: "Mine is yours and yours %0a> is yours designates the property of mercy" (Avot, 85). By imparting creation with %0a> his property, Avraham completely separated the impure forces (thoughts and %0a> desires) from the Shechina, and made it completely holy and pure. %0a> %0a> However, the Thought of Creation does not end here, for it lies in fulfilling %0a> the souls with delight. And the extent of pleasure depends on the aspiration to %0a> enjoy, on the degree of hunger. Only the extent of preliminary hunger, the will to %0a> receive pleasure, determines the extent of the subsequent reception of pleasure. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah and Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 371 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Shechina (Malchut de Atzilut, the sum of the souls) received its correction %0a> from Avraham— the Supernal force of Hassadim, the Sefira Hesed of ZA de Atzilut— %0a> and acquired the property of mercy from it. This property is completely free %0a> from any selfish will to receive, that is, its desire to receive something from the %0a> Creator has completely disappeared, and only the will to bestow upon Him %0a> remains. This desire is called "bestowal for the sake of bestowal." However, this %0a> brought no correction to the souls (parts of the Shechina), for their role is to %0a> receive the pleasure prepared for them by the Creator. To that end, they must %0a> first have the "will to receive." After all, pleasure is felt only when preceded by %0a> an aspiration or desire for it, and is determined by the extent of this desire. %0a> %0a> It is hence written that Avraham fathered Yitzchak: Yitzchak found the %0a> Shechina in absolute spiritual perfection, in the property of pure selfless bestowal, %0a> filled with Ohr Hassadim because of all the corrections made by Avraham. %0a> However, in accordance with his properties, Yitzchak (the left spiritual force) %0a> felt imperfection in this state of the Shechina— that it was not yet corrected to %0a> "receive" all that was conceived in the Thought of Creation. %0a> %0a> Therefore, he corrected it by turning it into a Kli (vessel) of reception, %0a> by supplementing it with the will "to receive," so that it could receive all the %0a> perfection prepared for it. Yitzchak evoked in the Shechina the will to receive %0a> pleasure from the Creator, albeit in the form of "reception for the Creator's %0a> sake"— with the intention of receiving pleasure in order to delight Him. %0a> %0a> The reception for the Creator's sake means that although man fervently %0a> wishes to receive pleasure, he receives not because he wishes to enjoy, but only %0a> because the bestowing Creator wishes for him to receive it. And had the Creator %0a> not wished it so, man would have no desire to receive from Him. %0a> %0a> Reception for the Creator's sake is equivalent to selfless bestowal. Thus, the %0a> egoistic, impure force, cannot cling to such a desire. %0a> %0a> Hence, Yitzchak corrected the Shechina and brought it to complete perfection, %0a> for now it can receive all that the Creator conceived to bestow upon it, as this is %0a> the purpose of His creation. %0a> %0a> Thus, after being corrected by Yitzchak, the state of Malchut-Shechina is %0a> called Heichal (the Creator's chambers), for now He can fill it with Himself, His %0a> Light, which means that He dwells in its halls. %0a> %0a> Yet, Avraham's correction, called "house," did not yet allow the Shechina to %0a> be filled and worthy of the Creator's presence. Hence, Yitzchak is considered %0a> to have corrected all the Gevurot (willpower and resistance to egoism in the %0a> souls of Israel). This means that he mitigated all the laws and restrictions in the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 372 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Creator's governance. This is because all restrictions and punishments come into %0a> this world for the sole purpose of correcting the souls' will to receive, to make %0a> them suitable for reception of the infinite goodness contained in the Thought %0a> of Creation. And since Yitzchak corrected the Shechina to complete perfection, %0a> all its restrictions and forces have been corrected, and all of its properties have %0a> attained the desired goal. %0a> %0a> However, his correction, too, did not retain this form in the Shechina, and %0a> became corrupted, for the world was still unprepared for the end of correction. %0a> Hence, Yitzchak fathered a sinner, Esav, who, being unable to resist the temptation %0a> to receive for himself, corrupted Yitzchak's correction in the Shechina. Unlike %0a> Yitzchak, he could not resist the selfish reception. This means that even when it %0a> became clear to him that the bestowing Creator did not wish for him to receive, %0a> he wanted to receive nonetheless, for such was his desire of self-gratification. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the impure force (Klipot-shells, the husk, or rind surrounding %0a> the pure forces) clung to the Shechina. Thus, the legs (Sefirot NHYM) of Partzuf %0a> Malchut de Atzilut descended to the place of the Klipot below Parsa, where egoistic %0a> desires dominate the desires of NHYM. %0a> %0a> Yet, the Rosh and the Upper Part of the Guf down to the Tabur of Partzuf %0a> Malchut remained above the rule of the impure forces. Hence, his head (Rosh) %0a> understands how he should act (hence, Yitzchak's head is buried together with %0a> the bodies of Avraham and Yaakov in the Machpela cave), but the body (Guf) still %0a> wants to receive pleasure for its own sake. %0a> %0a> And since Yaakov saw the damage caused by Esav, he corrected the Shechina %0a> by adding his property of fear to it, as it is written: "His hand had hold on Esav's %0a> heel" (The Torah, Beresheet, 25:26). Because Yaakov realized what imperfection %0a> Esav had caused in Shechina (in the created souls), he corrected himself in fear %0a> to such an extent that he raised the holy Shechina as a crown-adornment. By this %0a> he also retained the corrections made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a> %0a> However, Yaakov's correction was not final, for this fear is more similar to %0a> the fear of transgression than the selfless fear that comes from within. For this %0a> fear of his is born in him from Esav's hip, even though he had not transgressed %0a> by receiving, as did Esav. But the end of correction will bring a different state: %0a> Esav's hip will be annulled, as it is written: "Death will forever vanish from the %0a> world," and fear will remain only because the Creator is almighty and great. %0a> %0a> Yaakov attained this genuine fear by himself. However, the entire "community %0a> of Israel," all the souls that form the Shechina, still need to correct themselves %0a> in all the generations, from the first to the last, to the end of correction. (Only %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Torah and Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 373 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Moshe attained the property of true fear— one out of greatness and love— only %0a> he, and no one else. Hence, as the Talmud says, description of fear out of love %0a> for the Creator doesn't even exist.) %0a> %0a> The Zohar cites the words of the Psalm (5:8): "By Your great mercy I shall %0a> come into Your house," since Avraham corrected the Shechina up to the property %0a> of a "house" that is filled with goodness, i.e., with Ohr Hassadim. The words, %0a> "So as to bow before Your holy chamber," refer to Yitzchak, who corrected the %0a> Shechina from a "house" to a "chamber" that befits the Creator. The words, %0a> "in fear" refer to Yaakov, who corrected the Shechina with his property of fear, %0a> whereupon he made it a Kli (vessel) of reception that includes all the corrections %0a> made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a> %0a> Yet, how did he find out what else needed correction in the Shechina! Only %0a> by correcting and including himself in these three corrections performed by the %0a> holy Patriarchs before him. This means that, just as they did, Yaakov can act %0a> according to the conditions of these corrections. In other words, Yaakov merged %0a> with their properties, thereby ascending to their level. %0a> %0a> Thus, man must first attain these properties and correct them within him. %0a> Only after he assumes the properties of these three corrections into himself can %0a> he start correcting them from where our Patriarch Yaakov left off, i.e., elevating %0a> fear to the extent of the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, and drawing the %0a> Upper Light with his prayer, with his awe of the Creator's greatness. And the %0a> Upper Light will bring with it the fulfillment of the Shechina and the end of %0a> its correction. Hence, man's prayer must include two objectives: to obtain fear %0a> of the Creator's true greatness, and with this attainment, to achieve the final %0a> correction of his egoism. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 185. Rabbi Pinchas stood before Rabbi Rachuma on the shore of Lake %0a> Kinneret. He was wise, old, and almost blind. He said to Rabbi Pinchas: "1 %0a> have heard that our friend Shimon Bar-Yochai has a jewel, a son. I have looked %0a> upon the Light from that jewel, and it shines like the light of the sun, and %0a> illuminates the entire world." %0a> %0a> A fully corrected Malchut is called a jewel (usually a pearl). Rabbi Nachum %0a> tells Rabbi Pinchas that Rabbi Shimon has already merited complete correction, %0a> for a "son" designates the next state, the next Partzuf that emerges or is born %0a> from the preceding one. And Rabbi Pinchas sees this while looking (with his %0a> spiritual sight, called Ruach HaKodesh—the Holy Spirit) at the Light of this pearl, %0a> which shines like the sun emerging from its hiding (Nartik— sheath). This means %0a> that after the future correction of Malchut (the moon), her Light will become %0a> like that of the sun, and will illuminate the entire world. %0a> %0a> And when the Light of the moon becomes like that of the sun, it will rise to %0a> the zenith and illuminate the whole world with a pillar of Light, from Heaven %0a> to earth. And it will shine until Rabbi Shimon completes the correction of Ati/c. %0a> This speaks to the fact that he has already merited attaining the degrees of the %0a> Creator's two revelations, i.e., the end of correction. %0a> %0a> 186. And that Light extends from the Heavens down to the earth and %0a> illuminates the whole world until Atik-Keter appears and sits upon its throne, %0a> which occurs at the end of correction. And that Light abides entirely in your %0a> household (for the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was wife to Rabbi Shimon, and %0a> Rabbi Elazar was therefore his grandson). And a tiny ray of Light (called "the %0a> son of the household," Rabbi Elazar) separates from the Light that fills the %0a> household, comes forth and shines upon the whole world. Happy are those %0a> %0a> 375 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 376 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> who merit such a destiny! Come out, my son, come out! Go after that jewel, %0a> which illuminates the world, for it is a good time to do so! %0a> %0a> Since the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was the wife of Rabbi Shimon (Rabbi %0a> Shimon and his wife designate two spiritual Partzufim that are below Rabbi %0a> Pinchas), Rabbi Shimon (together with his wife) belonged to the household %0a> (was included in the Partzuf) of Rabbi Pinchas. This refers to Rabbi Elazar, the %0a> Partzuf that emerged from the Light and illuminated the world, which filled %0a> the household (ten Sefirot) of Rabbi Pinchas, i.e., came out of the Partzuf called %0a> "Rabbi Shimon and his wife." %0a> %0a> 187. He came out before him and stood waiting to board a ship. Two women %0a> were with him. He saw two birds soaring over the water. He raised his voice %0a> and said, "Birds, you soar over the sea; have you seen the place where one %0a> could find Bar-Yochai?" He waited some and said, "Birds, O birds, fly away." %0a> They flew away and disappeared into the sea. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon fled from the authorities that condemned him to death, and %0a> hid in a cave with his son. And no one knew where he was. Therefore, Rabbi %0a> Pinchas set out to look for him. %0a> %0a> Although everything described here is historically true, it is nonetheless %0a> essential for us to understand the words of The Zohar as the actions of Supernal %0a> spiritual causes, whose consequences determine all that transpires on earth. %0a> The egoistic authorities (forces) of a Partzuf as exalted as Rabbi Shimon's try %0a> to overcome his own altruistic aspirations and deprive him of the Light, that %0a> is, to kill him. And he hides from them in a cave, i.e., assumes a small state %0a> (Katnut) and shines with the Light of Mercy. This is referred to as "hides in %0a> a cave"— becomes invisible to egoistic forces, for they desire Ohr Hochma and %0a> cannot see Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> 188. Before he boarded the ship, the birds approached again, and in the beak %0a> of one of them was a letter. It read that Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, had %0a> left the cave together with his son, Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Pinchas went to them %0a> and found them completely changed: their bodies were covered with sores %0a> (like holes in the ground— see the Talmud, Bava Batra, 19:2) from staying in %0a> the cave for so long. He wept and said, "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi %0a> Shimon replied: "O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had %0a> you not seen me so, I would not have been what I am!" Rabbi Shimon opened %0a> about the Mitzvot of the Torah and said, "The Mitzvot of the Torah that the %0a> Creator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 377 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> While staying in the cave (in Ohr Hassadim) for many years (degrees), Rabbi %0a> Shimon had no choice but to sit in the sand (the external garment— Levush %0a> covering the Partzuf with a particular property, called "earth") in order to cover %0a> his naked body (desires) so he could study the Torah (receive the Upper Light in %0a> his Partzuf with the intention for the Creator's sake). As a result of being covered %0a> with sand, his entire "body" was covered with "rust and sores" (but these were %0a> necessary corrections). %0a> %0a> And not only did the Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon need the correction of %0a> concealment in Hassadim (cave) and the cover of an external garment (Returning %0a> Light), but his next state, fathered by him, called his son, Rabbi Elazar (a lower %0a> Partzuf), also needed these corrections to attain all of the Creator's Light. %0a> %0a> He wept and said: "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a> "O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had you not seen me so, %0a> I would not have been what I am!" In other words, if I would not look as I do, I %0a> would not have merited all the secrets of the Torah, for all that I have attained, %0a> I have attained during those thirteen years (thirteen successive corrections) of %0a> hiding in the cave. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon opened. It is written of the Mitzvot of the Torah: "The Mit^ot %0a> of the Torah that the Creator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0a> All of the Mitzvot of the Torah are described in the passage from the Torah, %0a> starting with "In the beginning the Creator created" and ending with "Let there %0a> be Light." These are the Mitzvot of fear and punishment, which include all the %0a> Mitzvot of the Torah. This is why they are called "in general." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The First Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 189. BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the Creator created) %0a> is the first Mitzva (commandment), the root and foundation of everything. %0a> And it is called "fear of the Creator" or Resheet (beginning), as it is written: %0a> "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom." Fear of the Creator is the %0a> beginning of wisdom, for this fear is called "the beginning." And it is the gate %0a> that leads to faith. And the whole world is based on this Mitzva. %0a> %0a> It is difficult to understand why fear is called "the beginning," and why it %0a> precedes wisdom and faith. The Zohar answers: it is because fear is the beginning %0a> of every Sefira, and it is impossible to attain any Sefira (property) without first %0a> attaining the property of fear. Yet, this implies that fear is merely a means of %0a> attaining other qualities or properties. But then, if it is only a means, then why %0a> is it included in the list of Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) as the first Mitzva 7 . Can it %0a> be that fear is a kind of prerequisite? %0a> %0a> Therefore, The Zohar says that it is impossible to attain perfect, selfless faith %0a> in any way other than through fear of the Creator. And the extent of fear will %0a> determine the extent of faith. Hence, the whole world is based on the Mitzva %0a> of fear, for the whole world exists only thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot, as %0a> the prophet said: "If not for My union with day and night, I would not have %0a> appointed the ordinances of Heaven and earth" (Yirmiyahu, 33:25). %0a> %0a> And since fear is the beginning and the gate to the other Mitzvot (for fear %0a> is also the gate to faith), the whole world is based on this property of fear. It %0a> is hence written that the Mitzva of fear includes all of the other Mitzvot of the %0a> Torah; and were it not for fear, the Creator would not have created anything. %0a> %0a> 190. There are three types of fear, two of which have no real basis, but one %0a> does. If man fears that his children may die, or fears illness or bodily suffering, %0a> or fears for his material well-being, this kind of fear (even if constant) is not %0a> the basis or root, for only desirable consequences constitute the cause of fear. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 379 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 380 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This is called "the fear of punishment in this world." But there is also another %0a> type of fear: the fear of punishment in the world to come, in hell. These %0a> two types of fear— the fear of punishment in this world and in the world to %0a> come— do not constitute real basis and root. %0a> %0a> 191. The real fear is the fear of the Creator, for He is great and almighty, for %0a> He is the Source of everything, and all else is nothing compared to Him. Man %0a> should concentrate all his attention on attaining this kind of fear. %0a> %0a> There are three kinds of fear before the Creator, but only one of them is %0a> considered true fear. If one is afraid of the Creator, and observes His Mitzvot so %0a> he and his children will be well and prosperous, this constitutes the first kind, %0a> the fear of the various punishments in this world. If he observes the Create %0a> Mitzvot because he fears punishments in hell, this is the second kind of fea %0a> Zohar says that neither of these two kinds is true, for man observes the Mitz %0a> only out of fear of punishment, for the sake of his own benefit, and not beca %0a> these are the Creator's Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> In this case, his personal wellbeing is the cause of his observance, and his %0a> r is merely a consequence of his will to receive pleasure. Rather, true fear %0a> t stem from the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, for He rules %0a> e source of everything. All the worlds emerge from Him, and His %0a> testify to His greatness. And all that He created is nothing compared tc %0a> for it adds nothing to Him. %0a> %0a> Thus, we can plainly see that there is no difference in action: one observes %0a> out of the first or second kinds of fear, while the other observes out of the third %0a> kind. To an onlooker, they perform the same actions, the Creator's Mitzvot. %0a> the enormous difference between them lies only in their intention, %0a> y they observe the Creator's decree! %0a> %0a> possible to discern man's spiritual degree by his %0a> itzvot, which is visible to all. Moreover, those who %0a> them in order to receive an immediate reward from others usually do so with %0a> the utmost outward zeal. But one whose intentions and thoughts are directed %0a> inwardly, who seeks true observance, as a rule, does not stand out amidst the %0a> masses in any way. %0a> %0a> One must constantly seek to perfect and complement his intentions only %0a> by observing the Mitzvot at an increasingly deeper level, while focusing on inner %0a> contemplation and direction of his thoughts. In no way should he engage in %0a> excessive "mechanical observance," on which there is a clear prohibition: "Do %0a> not exaggerate in the Mitzvot." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The First Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 381 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> On the contrary, one must devote all his attention to the attainment of true %0a> fear, as the Creator's first Mitzva decrees. As Rabbi Baruch Ashlag said, "Fear %0a> of the Creator is the constant, selfless desire that is expressed in the thought: %0a> 'Have I done everything I could for the Creator, or is there anything more that %0a> I can do for Him?'" %0a> %0a> 192. Rabbi Shimon started to weep, wailing, "Woe if 1 reveal and woe %0a> if I do not reveal. If 1 say, the sinners will know how to work for the %0a> Creator's sake, and if 1 do not say, it will not reach my friends." Wherever %0a> there is true fear, opposite it and correspondingly below stands an evil fear, %0a> which strikes and prosecutes. It is the scourge that whips the sinners %0a> (punishing them for their sins). This is why he is afraid to reveal it, for the %0a> sinners may learn how to avoid punishment, and punishment constitutes %0a> their correction! %0a> %0a> Here Rabbi Shimon warns that he cannot reveal everything in its entirety %0a> (this refers to Avoda Lishma— work "for the Creator's sake"), for he fears it may %0a> harm the sinners. Here he wishes to reveal how one can draw nearer and merge %0a> with the Tree of Life, and therewith refrain from touching the Tree of Death. %0a> However, this refers only to those who have already corrected themselves with %0a> regard to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, the sinners (those who have yet to correct their transgressions %0a> in the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) are not entitled to know this, for %0a> they still need to toil in all the required tasks until they correct themselves in %0a> the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus we see that the Torah defines a %0a> sinner as one who is yet to correct the Tree of Knowledge in his soul. %0a> %0a> The prohibition on revealing the true essence of the work for the Creator's %0a> sake is based on the words of the Torah: "Behold, Adam has become as one of %0a> us in knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take %0a> also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever" {Be.re.she.et, 3:22). %0a> %0a> After Adam's sin in the Tree of Knowledge, the Creator banished him %0a> from the Garden of Eden to prevent Adam from connecting to the Tree of Life %0a> and gaining eternal life. This is because then, what he corrupted in the Tree %0a> of Knowledge would remain uncorrected. Therefore, to let only the righteous %0a> know this wisdom, Rabbi Shimon reveals it by way of allusion. %0a> %0a> 193. But he who fears the punishment by whippings, the true fear of the %0a> Creator cannot descend upon him. Instead, evil fear overtakes him in the %0a> form of fearing punishment by whipping. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 382 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 194. Therefore, the place that is named "fear of the Creator" is called the %0a> beginning of knowledge. This is why this Mitzva is included here. And it is %0a> the foundation and source of all the other Mitzvot of the Torah. And whoever %0a> observes the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, thereby observes all the others. But %0a> he who does not observe the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, does not observe %0a> the other Mitzvot of the Torah, for this Mitzva constitutes the foundation for %0a> all the others. %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar repeats that in one place it is written, "Fear of the Creator %0a> is the beginning of wisdom," while in another it says, "Fear of the Creator is the %0a> beginning of knowledge." And The Zohar explains that where the property of %0a> fear ends, another evil fear begins, one that slanders and whips. In this regard, %0a> it is said in Kabbalah that the legs of a pure Partzuf Malchut descend to a place %0a> of impure forces. %0a> %0a> However, he who observes the Mitzva of fear because the Creator is great %0a> and almighty unites with Him (becomes equal to the Creator in his properties), %0a> so as to not feel shame in receiving from Him. Besides this correction, no other %0a> work exists for the creatures. %0a> %0a> This is called "fear of the Creator for the sake of life," for as a result of %0a> merging with the Creator, creatures are filled with life. Otherwise, they fall %0a> under the power of the restriction, as Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) restricted %0a> the reception of Light in egoistic desires. Such a Kli (desire) becomes a cause %0a> of death, for it is an empty place (devoid of Light). Hence, creatures must fear %0a> failing to make the corrections that they were entrusted with. %0a> %0a> However, those who observe the Mitzvot out of fear, rather than out of %0a> realization of the Creator's greatness and His decree, are ruled and whipped by %0a> the fear of an empty Malchut. And since the end of fear lies in the evil scourge, %0a> true fear is called "The beginning of knowledge of the fear of the Creator," %0a> which indicates the necessity to aspire only to this kind of fear, and beware of %0a> the evil kind. Because of this, Adam's sin is corrected. %0a> %0a> 195. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (signifying fear) THE %0a> CREATOR CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. For whoever %0a> transgresses here, transgresses all of the Torah Mitzvot. And his punishment %0a> is the evil scourge, i.e., the evil fear that whips him. The words, AND THE %0a> EARTH WAS UNFORMED AND CHAOTIC, AND DARKNESS WAS %0a> UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP, AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR %0a> refer to the four punishments of the wicked. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The First Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 383 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 196. WITHOUT FORM refers to strangulation. CHAOTIC refers to stoning, %0a> i.e., the stones that fall into the great deep to punish the sinners. DARKNESS %0a> signifies burning, the fire that falls upon the heads of the wicked to burn %0a> them down. THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR refers to beheading. %0a> %0a> Those who observe the Mitzva of fear before the Creator not because such is %0a> His decree, but because they are afraid of punishment, fall into the impure force's %0a> trap, called "without form." As a result, they are lost, having no understanding %0a> of the Creator's thoughts and deeds. And this impure force is defined as a rope %0a> on man's neck, blocking the inflow of pure (holy) air to his soul and preventing %0a> him from gaining life. And to the extent of man's ignorance, the impure force %0a> strangulates him! %0a> %0a> And when he is caught in the impure force's noose, tightening around his %0a> neck, it has the power to control man at its will: to stone, burn, or behead him. %0a> Stoning means that impure thoughts befall his head with desired pleasures, %0a> thus pulling him down into the deep. There they punish him with darkness %0a> (burning), and the impure force turns him on fierce fire until it burns all the %0a> pure life-force out of him. %0a> %0a> 197. The spirit of the Creator means beheading, for the scorching wind %0a> (Ruach Se'ara) is a flaming sword— punishment for whoever does not observe %0a> the Torah and Mitzvot that are mentioned after the Mitzva of fear, called %0a> "foundation," as it includes all the Mitzvot. This is because after the word %0a> BERESHEET (BEGINNING), which signifies fear, it is written WITHOUT %0a> FORM, CHAOS, DARKNESS and SPIRIT-in all, the four penalties of death. %0a> And then follow the rest of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> Following the first sentence of the Torah, the remaining part of the Torah %0a> refers to the rest of the Mitzvot, which are particular with regard to the general %0a> and all-inclusive Mitzva of fear. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Second Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 198. The second Mit^va (commandment) is inseparably connected with the %0a> TAitzva of fear, and it is the M.itzva of love— for man to love his Creator with %0a> perfect love. What is perfect love? It is a great love, as it is written, "He walks %0a> before the Creator in complete sincerity and perfection" (Beresheet, 17:1), %0a> which signifies perfection in love. Thus, it is written, "And the Creator said, %0a> 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3)— this is perfect love, called "great love." %0a> This is precisely how man should love his Creator. %0a> %0a> There exists conditional love, which appears as a result of all the goodness %0a> received from the Creator ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," items %0a> 66-74), as a result of which man merges with the Creator with all his heart and %0a> soul. Yet, although he merges with the Creator in complete perfection, this %0a> love is considered imperfect. It is similar to Noah's love (Beresheet Raba, 30), %0a> who constantly needed to reinforce his feeling— to see that the Creator sends %0a> him only goodness. %0a> %0a> Avraham, however, needed nothing to reinforce his love for the Creator, %0a> as it is written: "He walks before the Creator in complete perfection." For the %0a> words "walks before" mean that he needs nothing to reinforce his feeling of love %0a> for the Creator. And even if he does not receive anything from Him, his love %0a> remains constant and perfect, and he wishes to merge with the Creator with his %0a> heart and soul. %0a> %0a> 199. Rabbi Elazar said, "I have heard what perfect love means." He was told, %0a> "Tell this to Rabbi Pinchas, as he truly exists on that degree." Rabbi Elazar %0a> said, "Perfect love means that it is perfect on both sides; if it does not include %0a> both sides, such a love is imperfect." %0a> %0a> He was told to turn to Rabbi Pinchas, for Rabbi Pinchas had already %0a> attained the degree of perfect love and will be able understand him correctly. %0a> %0a> 385 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 386 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The words "on both sides" refer to both the good side and the evil side. In other %0a> words, if the Creator gives him not only goodness, but restrictions, too (which %0a> he perceives as unpleasant), and even if He takes his soul away, still man's love %0a> for the Creator remains perfect, as though he receives from Him nothing but %0a> the very best in the world. %0a> %0a> 200. Therefore, there is he who loves the Creator in order to gain riches, %0a> live a long life, have many healthy children, and rule over his enemies— he %0a> receives everything he wants, and this is why he loves the Creator. However, %0a> should he receive the opposite, should the Creator lead him through a wheel %0a> of suffering, he will come to hate the Creator, and will feel no love toward %0a> Him whatsoever. Therefore, such a love is baseless. %0a> %0a> Since his love depends on what he receives from the Creator, when %0a> reception stops, so does his love. Clearly, man can love only one or the other— %0a> himself or the Creator! %0a> %0a> 201. Love is considered perfect if it exists on both sides— on the side of judgment %0a> and the side of mercy (success in life). As we already mentioned, when one %0a> loves the Creator, even if He were to take away his soul, this love would remain %0a> perfect on both sides: mercy and judgment. Therefore, the Light of the %0a> First Act of Creation was revealed and then concealed. And because of this %0a> concealment, strict judgment appeared in the world, and both sides, mercy %0a> and judgment, united to form perfection. And this is the desired love. %0a> %0a> The Light that was created on the first day of creation (in the verse "Let there %0a> be Light") was later concealed, as it is written, for the righteous in the world to %0a> come. It was concealed so as to let strict judgment appear in this world. %0a> %0a> This leads to the unification of the two sides (mercy and judgment) into one, %0a> for man receives an opportunity to reveal the perfection of love even when the %0a> Creator takes his soul away, and he is given an opportunity to supplement and %0a> perfect his love. And had the Light not been concealed, strict judgment would %0a> not have been revealed, and the GREAT LOVE would have been concealed %0a> from the righteous, and there would be no way of revealing it. %0a> %0a> 202. Rabbi Shimon kissed him. Rabbi Pinchas approached, kissed and blessed %0a> him. He said, "It is clear that the Creator has sent me here. This is the tiny %0a> ray of Light that was said to be shining in my house, and would later light up %0a> the whole world" (item 186). Rabbi Elazar said that fear must certainly not be %0a> forgotten from all the Mitzvot; especially in this Mitzva, the Mitzva of love, %0a> fear must be attached to this Mitzva at all times. How is it attached? Love is %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Second Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 387 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> good when it brings goodness, health, sustenance, and life from the Beloved %0a> One. And it is here that fear of sinning must be revived, so that the wheel does %0a> not turn against him, as it is written, "Happy is the man who always fears," %0a> for his fear is contained in his love. %0a> %0a> 203. This is how fear should be evoked from the perspective of strict judgment, %0a> for once man realizes that strict judgment hovers over him, he must evoke %0a> within him fear of his Master. Thus, his heart will not be hardened, of which %0a> it is written, "He that hardens his heart shall fall into evil," into the other %0a> side. This is called evil. Therefore, fear unites with both sides— with goodness %0a> and love, as well as with strict judgment, and consists of both. And if fear is %0a> united with the good side and love, as well as with the strictness of judgment, %0a> such a love is perfect. %0a> %0a> The Mitzva of fear includes all the Mitzvot of the Torah; it is the gateway to %0a> faith in the Creator— to the extent of his fear, man acquires faith in the Creator's %0a> governance. Hence, he must not forget fear in observing every Mitzva, especially %0a> the Mitzva of love, at which time fear needs to be roused even more, for fear %0a> must constantly be present in the Mitzva of love. Therefore, man must evoke %0a> fear within him in the two states of love: in love from the good side, when he %0a> receives good sensations from the Creator, and in love from the evil side, when %0a> the Creator sends him harsh restrictions, according to judgment. %0a> %0a> However, it would be incorrect to think that perfect love means a state %0a> where one receives bad feelings from the Creator, to the extent of feeling one's %0a> soul being taken away. It is incorrect to think that one should not fear the %0a> Creator's judgment and strictness, and, despite his feelings to cling unto Him %0a> with love, fearlessly and wholeheartedly. %0a> %0a> First, one must rouse fear within him lest his love for the Creator will %0a> weaken. Thus, he combines love and fear. Second, from the other side of love, %0a> from the side of feeling the strictness, he must rouse within him fear before %0a> the Creator, and not let his heart harden, so it would not stop heeding the %0a> unpleasant sensations of punishment. Thus, here, too, he includes fear and %0a> love, and if he acts so in both sides of love, his love remains forever connected %0a> to fear, thus becoming perfect. %0a> %0a> It is written about the good side's inclusion of fear into love: "Happy is %0a> the man who always fears." The word "always" indicates that although man %0a> always receives only goodness from the Creator, he fears Him nonetheless, for %0a> he fears that he may sin. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 388 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> And it is written about the evil side's inclusion of fear into love, when man %0a> feels punishments and strictness of judgment: "He who lets his heart be hardened %0a> shall fall into awe." This means that one should in no way and under no circum- %0a> stances let his heart be hardened under the judgment's influence. Otherwise, he %0a> will fall into the impure forces, called "evil." In such a case, he must rouse within %0a> him even more fear of the Creator, and mingle his fear into the love. %0a> %0a> However, neither kind is fear for oneself, for one's own well-being. Rather, %0a> they both refer to man's fear of diminishing his intentions and actions for the %0a> Creator's sake, and his attempts to direct them all towards pleasing Him. %0a> %0a> Thus, we have clarified the first two Mitzvot of the Torah— the Mitzvot of fear %0a> and love. The Mitzva of fear is the basis for all the other Mitzvot and of the entire %0a> Torah. It is contained in the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET (IN THE %0a> BEGINNING), and in its first sentence, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a> CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Fear is called BEGINNING, %0a> from which THE HEAVENS and THE EARTH are born, meaning ZON and %0a> their descendants, the worlds of BYA. And the second sentence in the Torah %0a> refers to punishment in the form of four kinds of spiritual death: WITHOUT %0a> FORM means strangulation, CHAOTIC means stoning, DARKNESS means %0a> burning, and SPIRIT means beheading. The Mitzva of love is described in the %0a> Torah in the verse: AND THE CREATOR SAID, 'LET THERE BE LIGHT' %0a> %0a> There are two sides to this Mitzva, which are called "kindness and longevity" %0a> and "with all one's soul." This implies that man should feel love even under the %0a> worst kinds of circumstances, i.e., when the Creator takes his soul away, just as %0a> he feels it when everything is well. %0a> %0a> Just to reveal this perfect love, the Light of creation was concealed. Fear must %0a> also be included in both sides of love: in the part where man must fear to commit %0a> a sin, thereby reducing his love for the Creator, and in the part where he must fear %0a> because of the concealment and the Creator's judgment. Yet, to understand these %0a> spiritual categories, we must clarify them in a slightly different manner. %0a> %0a> Calls for love are used repeatedly in the Torah: "Love thy neighbor...," "Do %0a> not do what you hate to another," and so on. But the basis of all this is love %0a> between man and the Creator; this is where our requests are directed: "Draw us %0a> nearer with love...," "He who chooses Israel with love..." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Second Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 389 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> We can take as an example the natural love between father and son. Parents %0a> naturally love their only son more than anything in the world. Accordingly, the %0a> son should hold the same kind of love for his parents. Yet, we see that this is not %0a> so: if the son feels unconditional love from his parents, then, in accordance with %0a> nature's law and regardless of himself, his love for them will decrease. %0a> %0a> This is so because the father's love for his son is natural; and just as the %0a> father wants his son to love him, his son wants to be loved by his father. This %0a> reciprocal desire gives rise to fear in both their hearts: the father is afraid that %0a> the son may hate him (even a little), and the son fears the same. %0a> %0a> This constant fear begets good deeds between them: each of them aspires %0a> to show his love to the other, so as to promote reciprocity. Yet, when their love %0a> reaches peaks, and there is nothing else that can be added to it, the beloved son %0a> discovers absolute and unconditional love in the heart of his loving father. %0a> %0a> The loved one immediately stops fearing that he will be loved less; neither %0a> can he hope that the love for him will grow. And this leads to a situation where %0a> the son grows lazy and stops expressing his love with good deeds. And as they %0a> lessen, his love lessens, too, until it is reversed into its opposite— hatred, for he %0a> deems everything his father does as worthless and insufficient in comparison %0a> with what the father's actions out of "absolute" love should be. Therefore, the %0a> union of love and fear within man brings him to the state of perfection. %0a> %0a> The four letters HaVaYaH (Yod + Hey + Vav + Hey) correspond to Sefirot %0a> H-B-ZA-M. The Zohar calls them, FEAR, LOVE, TORAH, COMMAND- %0a> MENT, respectively. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> YOD - %0a> %0a> %0a> - HOCHMA - %0a> %0a> %0a> FEAR %0a> %0a> %0a> HEY - %0a> %0a> %0a> - BINA %0a> %0a> %0a> LOVE %0a> %0a> %0a> VAV - %0a> %0a> %0a> - ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> TORAH %0a> %0a> %0a> HEY - %0a> %0a> %0a> - MALCHUT - %0a> %0a> %0a> COMMANDMENT %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf AA is the main Partzuf, and includes the entire world of Atzilut It %0a> shines upon all the other worlds through its garments, called AVI, YESHSL7T and %0a> ZON, where AVI and YESHSUT clothe AA from its Peh to Tabur, while ZON %0a> clothe AA from Tabur down to its Slum Raglairn (end of legs) that stand on Parsa. %0a> %0a> AA is called "the concealed Hochma," as its Ohr Hochma is concealed in %0a> its Rosh and does not shine upon the other Partzufim and worlds, and only its %0a> Bina shines below. Thus, it is Bina (and not AA) that is called BERESHEET— %0a> BEGINNING, for she is the foundation and the source of all the worlds. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 390 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> And she is also called FEAR OF THE CREATOR, i.e., fear of His greatness, %0a> "for He is the only Master and the root of all, and all that exists is as nothing %0a> compared to Him." And ZON (called HEAVEN AND EARTH) emerge from %0a> Bina. It is therefore written in the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING (with fear) AVI, %0a> THE CREATOR CREATED HEAVEN (ZA) AND EARTH (Malchut). %0a> %0a> Hence, it is said: "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom (Hochma)" %0a> and "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." Ohr Hochma %0a> stems not from the Sefira Hochma de AA, but from Bina de AA alone. For when %0a> Bina de AA ascends to Rosh de AA, it turns to the Sefira Hochma and then passes the %0a> Light downward. It follows that the Sefira Bina, fear of the Creator, is the source of %0a> Ohr Hochma; hence, it is said, "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of Hochma." %0a> %0a> Also, fear is the beginning of knowledge, for the Sefira Daat is the beginning %0a> of ZON: ZON raise their request to Rosh de AA in order to receive Hochma. %0a> And this request of ZON regarding reception of Ohr Hochma, which is received %0a> and felt by AA, is called Daat, knowledge. This is why it is written: "Fear of the %0a> Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." %0a> %0a> The Zohar also tells us that afterwards fear and love unite so as never to part %0a> again, for Hochma is called "love." Indeed, the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH %0a> is Bina, i.e., GAR de Bina (AVI) that wants only Ohr Hassadim, whereas Ohr %0a> Hochma is concealed within it. %0a> %0a> And the place of revelation of Ohr Hochma is ZAT de Bina, called YESHSL7T, %0a> the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH. Therefore, this place is called love, %0a> and it is the second Mitzva that follows the first Mitzva of fear, which shines in %0a> ZON, for this Ohr Hochma does not stem from Hochma de AVI, but from Bina, %0a> and Bina is known as fear. %0a> %0a> And The Zohar says that fear unites with love so as to never let it go. This %0a> means that Bina forever unites with Hochma and does not part with it. And %0a> wherever there is Bina, Hochma is there alongside her. And although it seems to %0a> write that one Mitzva is fear and another is love (that these are separate Mitzvot), %0a> they are nonetheless always together and are never apart: just as the first Mitzva %0a> includes the first, so the first includes the second. %0a> %0a> The reason they have separate names is that we distinguish them by their %0a> dominance: in the first Mitzva, it is AVI, GAR de Bina, Bina herself along with her %0a> property. Hence, it is called "fear." However, in the second Mitzva it is Hochma %0a> that is dominant; hence, it is called "love." %0a> %0a> Therefore, the words of the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a> CREATED constitute concealment, and the revelation of these words begins %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Second Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 391 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> with the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, designating the ascent of Bina %0a> (BEGINNING) to Rosh de AA, where Bina becomes like Hochma. %0a> %0a> The combination of Hochma and Bina is then called GREAT LOVE. This %0a> is the meaning of the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, for Bina ascends to AA %0a> and passes the Light to all the lower worlds with GREAT LOVE, i.e., by means %0a> of two Lights: Hassadim and Hochma. %0a> %0a> This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S LOVE IS CLARIFIED FROM %0a> TWO SIDES, as it is written: LET THERE BE LIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND %0a> IN THE WORLD TO COME. Because the Creator saw that this world cannot %0a> receive the Light, He concealed His Light and raised it above Parsa de AA, called %0a> (according to its corrected properties) "the world to come," above Chazeh de AA, %0a> where AVI or GAR de Bina reside. %0a> %0a> Parsa is located below Chazeh de AA, and it separates the Supernal Waters %0a> (AVI) from the lower waters (YESHSL7T + ZON). Since Ohr Hochma does not %0a> shine below Chazeh de AA, it is said that the Light is concealed from Partzufim %0a> YESHSUTand ZON. %0a> %0a> Thus, we see that Bina is divided into two parts: GAR de Bina (AVI), located %0a> above the Chazeh (Parsa de AA or the Supernal Waters), upon whom the Upper %0a> Light shines, meaning that secrets are revealed within them. He who ascends to %0a> this degree receives its Light, thereby meriting "wealth (Hochma) and longevity %0a> (Hassadim). His sons (his future corrections) are like olive sprouts (olive oil %0a> symbolizes Hochma), they gather round his table (Hassadim), and he rules over %0a> his enemies (impure forces), and whatever his wish may be, he succeeds in it %0a> (for Ohr Hochma is clothed in Ohr Hassadim)." ZAT de Bina are the lower waters, %0a> located below Chazeh de AA. The Light is concealed from them, and those who %0a> receive from them must love the Creator with the kind of love called "even if He %0a> takes away his soul." %0a> %0a> These are the two degrees of love for the Creator. That is to say, love for %0a> the Creator is not the desire and decision of man alone. Rather, like any of our %0a> other desires, it appears only by attaining a particular degree: if one attains the %0a> degree of YESHSUT, it allows him to love the Creator "even if He takes away %0a> his soul." However, an even more perfect love emerges within him who reaches %0a> the degree of AVI: he receives such Light from it that his love for the Creator %0a> becomes perfect on both sides. %0a> %0a> Yet, fear must be included in both kinds of love. For at the degree of AVI, %0a> one needs fear so as to not sin while in a state of spiritual ascent in AVI. And %0a> while at the degree of YESHSUT, one must fear lest his heart be hardened, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 392 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> for Hochma and Bina correspond to love and fear in a state of eternal unity. %0a> Therefore, one must include the properties of Bina (fear) into GAR de Bina %0a> (AVI), as well as into ZAT de Bina (YESHSUT). %0a> %0a> Only then will love be perfect on both sides, in both forms: GAR and ZAT %0a> de Bina. Love cannot possibly be perfect only on one side, but only if fear exists %0a> on both sides, for Hochma (love) cannot exist without Bina (fear). %0a> %0a> It follows that conditional love is the degree of AVI, whereas unconditional %0a> (perfect) love is the degree of YESHSLT. Yet, YESHSLT is below AVI. The thing %0a> is that man first receives Higher Sefirot of his emerging Partzuf, in the order %0a> KHB-ZA-M, but the Light enters them in the reverse order of NRNHY: first, he %0a> receives the Sefira Keter with the Light of Ne/esh, and in the end he receives the %0a> Sefira Malchut, though the Light of Yechida enters Keter. Therefore, if we measure %0a> according to the Sefirot (Kelim), the degree of AVI = GE = K-H (conditional love) %0a> is smaller than the degree of YESHSLT = AHP = B-ZA-M (unconditional love). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Third Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 204. The third M.itzva is to know that there is an Almighty Lord who governs %0a> the world, to unite this every day in the six Supernal limbs: HQT NHY of %0a> Zeir Anpin, and to unify them in the six words of the prayer "Hear O Israel," %0a> and with it to direct our desires upwards. Therefore, we must prolong the %0a> word "one" in the six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the %0a> Lord is one." %0a> %0a> In correspondence with the instruction to prolong the word "one," he who %0a> utters this verse should pronounce this word lengthily, as ooone. However, The %0a> Zohar obviously alludes not to a simple utterance of one's mouth, but rather to %0a> our true heartfelt intentions. %0a> %0a> What is indicated here is that one needs to know and make a union. First, %0a> one must know the two sides of love, AVI and YESHSUT. AVI are called the %0a> "big and great ones in Hassadim," whereas YESHSUT is called "the Master of the %0a> World," for it contains judgment and restriction. %0a> %0a> After man has attained both degrees of love and merited perfect love, he %0a> needs to know that there is a great Master who governs the entire world, and %0a> to unite this knowledge every day by using the six Supernal limbs, sides, that is, %0a> to raise MAN to ZON de Atzilut, and ZON will raise their MAN to YESHSUT. %0a> As a result, ZON and YESHSUT will ascend and unite with Partzuf AVI. This %0a> common Partzuf has six Supernal sides-limbs, for they all clothe VAK, the six %0a> lower Sefirot of AA. %0a> %0a> Because of this unity, YESHSUT ascends above Parsa de AA, to the place %0a> from the Peh down to the Chazeh, the place of the Supernal Waters. This is the %0a> permanent place of AVI, and the place where Light is revealed. When YESHSUT %0a> is filled with this Light, it passes it to ZON, which pass it on to the lower worlds, %0a> leading to the revelation of Ohr Hassadim in all the worlds. This is the secret of %0a> the union of "Hear, O Israel." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 393 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 394 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One" %0a> constitute the six sides of ZON, which need to be united so as to unite them %0a> with the six Supernal sides, that is, AVI and YESHSUT. And man must direct %0a> his intentions and NRN upwards, so they, too, would unite with Supernal unity, %0a> just as MAN. %0a> %0a> To achieve unity in VAK de ZA, in its six sides, the word "one" must be %0a> prolonged, meaning to receive Ohr Hochma within it, for Ohr Hochma descends %0a> from Ein Sof (infinity) to Supernal VAK, i.e., to AVI and YESHSUT, and unites %0a> VAK de ZA with the Light of Ein Sof. This is because the Gematria (numerical %0a> value) of the Hebrew word Echad (one) is Aleph + Chet + Dalet =1 + 8 + 4= 13, %0a> which indicates reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> Hence, while pronouncing the word "one," one should intend to draw %0a> Ohr Hochma to VAK de ZA. However, this unity lacks the intention to receive %0a> the Light of GAR in ZA, but only to enlarge its VAK through unity with the %0a> Supernal VAK, and to receive VAK de Gadlut. %0a> %0a> 205. It is therefore written, "Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered %0a> together onto one place." This means that all the degrees under the Heavens %0a> will gather onto one place, to become perfect in the six ends. Therewith, fear %0a> must be attached to the unity of the words: "Hear, O Israel," which is done by %0a> prolonging the pronunciation of the letter Dalet in the word Echad. This is %0a> why the letter Dalet in the word Echad is written larger than the other letters. %0a> It is written, "Let the dry land appear," to let the letter Dalet (designating dry %0a> land) be attached to that unity. %0a> %0a> As was already explained, the unity contained in the words "Hear, O Israel" %0a> refers to the reception of Gadlut by VAK. This is because "one place" signifies %0a> the Supernal VAK, where the Light of Ein Sof shines within Ohr Hochma, under %0a> the Heavens (Bina), with regard to the earth (ZA). The words "onto one place" %0a> imply the unification of all the six Upper and lower sides, so the lower Partzufim %0a> will receive Ohr Hochma and unite with VAK de ZA, but only as VAK de Gadlut. %0a> %0a> As we have already clarified, there are two kinds of fear and two kinds of %0a> love: the Upper fear and love are called AVI, whereas the lower fear and love are %0a> called YESHSUT. However, perfection is attained only by attaining both degrees %0a> together. Hence, the Light is concealed in YESHSUT, so the lower kind of love %0a> ("even if He takes away the soul") will be revealed. But even in this case, fear %0a> must cling to love and prevent the hardening of the heart; only then does one %0a> reveal perfect love, merges with AVI and YESHSUT, and receives the complete %0a> Creator's goodness. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Third Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 395 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> In the unity of "Hear, O Israel," and after ZON ascend and unite with their %0a> properties in the six Upper sides to receive within them the "Great Love" in the %0a> word "one," they receive the Light that was made on the first day of creation, of %0a> which it is written: "And the Creator said, 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3). %0a> %0a> And to all of this unity one must attach fear, since he needs to reveal and %0a> receive the Light that is deliberately concealed in YESHSUT, so as to unite the %0a> lower love and fear, for they still cannot be considered perfect. %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is said that one should prolong the pronunciation of the Dalet %0a> in the word Echad (one) when reciting the prayer, Shema Israel, Adonay Eloheinu, %0a> Adonay EchaD-D-Dl (Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One). %0a> In this case, the letter Dalet is written in large font. This is because big letters %0a> refer to Tvuna, and the big Dalet in the word Echad indicates that its place is in %0a> Tvuna, and that the Light is concealed there. By attracting it, not by utterance, %0a> of course, but by the spiritual action, man unites its concealment with the lower %0a> fear and love. %0a> %0a> AND THE DRY LAND APPEARED means that there is no perfection %0a> in the Upper fear and love, expressed in the six words of the prayer "Hear, %0a> O Israel" with the help of the word "one." These words correspond to "Let %0a> there be Light," until the unity of fear and love is achieved below. This unity is %0a> revealed in the Light that is concealed in Tvuna, designated by the letter Dalet %0a> (D) in the word Echad. %0a> %0a> Therefore, after the WATERS GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE %0a> PLACE, signifying the descent of Ohr Hochma into the six parts of ZA, DRY %0a> LAND APPEARED. It denotes the letter Dalet in the word Echad, which should %0a> be pronounced with (spiritual) prolongation, with the aim to turn it into land %0a> through the concealment of the Light. %0a> %0a> All of this is essential in order to unite the D, Tvuna, with AVI, resulting in %0a> the descent of the Light to VAK de ZON, so that love could be made perfect. %0a> %0a> 206. After Mcdchut unites with ZA Above (in VAK de ZON), they must %0a> now be united below, in the masses, i.e., in all six sides of Malchut, in %0a> the words, BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED %0a> (Blessed be the great name of His kingdom for ever and ever), which contain %0a> six other words of unity. And then, what was dry land will become fertile %0a> soil, yielding fruit and plant. %0a> %0a> After the Supernal union is achieved, when the letter Dalet in the word %0a> Echad becomes whole Above, in AVI, it is essential to unite the Dalet in the %0a> word Echad below, in VAK, in the six aspects of Nukva de ZA (Rachel), who %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 396 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> stands from Chazeh de ZA and below. All 600,000 souls of Israel, called "the %0a> inhabitants of Nukva," are included in Rachel. %0a> %0a> After ZA unites in the Light of AVI, and the concealment of Tvuna (in the %0a> words DRY LAND APPEARED or in the letter Dalet) is revealed in him, Nukva %0a> must be filled with these two revelations. This is designated by the six words, %0a> BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED, corresponding to the %0a> six Sefirot HGT NHY of Nukva. %0a> %0a> It was already explained that the Light was concealed in order to reveal %0a> both sides of love— good and evil. Yet, neither side of love, good or evil, can %0a> be revealed through concealment, but only through revelation of judgment. %0a> Before judgment was revealed, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was DRY %0a> LAND— utterly useless. This is because it emerged from the Light due to the %0a> concealment. Even fear to unite in the lower fear and love, which supplement %0a> the Upper fear and love was absent from it, for the judgment that reveals the %0a> lower fear and love was not yet revealed. %0a> %0a> Strictness and judgment are located in the legs of Partzuf Leah, which are %0a> included in the Rosh of Partzuf Rachel. ZA has two Nukvaot (plural for Nu/cva): %0a> Leah (above his Chazeh) and Rachel (below his Chazeh). Leah's legs end at the %0a> Chazeh de ZA and touch Rachel's Rosh. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> %0a> AA %0a> %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> %0a> YESHSUT %0a> %0a> %0a> NukvaotofZA %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> Leah: Head %0a> %0a> %0a> Head %0a> %0a> %0a> Body %0a> %0a> %0a> Mouth %0a> %0a> %0a> Legs %0a> %0a> %0a> Chest %0a> %0a> %0a> Rachel: Head %0a> %0a> %0a> Chest %0a> %0a> %0a> Body %0a> %0a> %0a> Legs %0a> %0a> %0a> Legs %0a> %0a> %0a> Feet %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Worlds of BYA %0a> %0a> Machsom %0a> %0a> Our World %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Third Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 397 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Since strictness and judgment are located at the end of the legs of Partzuf %0a> Leah, this affects only Partzuf Rachel, as each spiritual property acts only from %0a> the place of its manifestation and below. Therefore, the concealment in the %0a> lower love and fear manifests only in the place in Rachel where the force of %0a> strictness and judgment is manifested. %0a> %0a> Prior to the revelation of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was %0a> dry land, a place that is unfit for living. Now, however, after the descent of Partzuf %0a> Rachel into VAK, below Chazeh de ZA, the dry land became fertile, suitable for %0a> settlement and cultivation of fruits. In other words, the lower love and fear %0a> were revealed in it in completion and perfection. And they complement the %0a> Upper love and fear, so that all are perfect on both sides, for that is when all the %0a> goodness is revealed in AVI. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said, THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH- %0a> ERETZ (the word Eretz is derived from Ration— desire), for it is the property of %0a> the letter Dalet in the word Echad in the six Sefirot (sides) of Nukva de ZA (where %0a> the property of strictness and judgment is already revealed). The letter Dalet that %0a> was in DRY LAND and made its property inanimate and unfit to live on turns %0a> into EARTH in Nukva de ZA (as a result of a Zivug with ZA), can now be settled %0a> and cultivated; hence, the Creator called it "earth." %0a> %0a> 207. It is written, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH. %0a> This refers to the same unity below, by the words, BLESSED BE HIS GREAT %0a> NAME FOR EVER AND EVER, when the earth, called "desire," became %0a> what it should be. For the word "earth" (Eretz) means desire (Ratzon). Hence, %0a> the expression IT WAS GOOD appears twice on the third day of creation: %0a> once for the Upper unity and once for the lower. For Malchut merges with %0a> both sides of ZA— with VAK de ZA and with her own VAK. Henceforth, the %0a> earth brings forth grass, for it has been corrected to yield fruit. %0a> %0a> The Upper unity (described by the words, WATERS GATHERED %0a> TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE) passes the Light that was created on the %0a> first day of creation from Above downwards, from the six Upper sides of AVI %0a> to VAK de ZA. This is called by the first word, IT WAS GOOD, uttered by the %0a> Creator on the third day of creation. %0a> %0a> And then occurs the lower unity, designated by the verse, BLESSED BE HIS %0a> GREAT NAME FOR EVER AND EVER. This means that the letter Dalet in %0a> the word Echad attains perfection only from the six sides of Nu/cva, as described %0a> by the verses, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 398 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> THE EARTH SHALL BRING FORTH GRASS, for in VAK de Nukva, DRY %0a> LAND turned to EARTH, yielding fruits. %0a> %0a> With regard to this unity of VAK de Nukva, the Creator said, IT WAS %0a> GOOD, for the second time on the third day of creation. It follows that when %0a> IT WAS GOOD is said for the first time, it refers to the Upper unity. And the %0a> second time refers to the lower. Because of the lower unity, both sides of love %0a> achieve perfection, and the Light of AVI descends to VAK de Nukva, and bears %0a> fruit for the 600,000 souls of Israel that inhabit her. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 208. The fourth Mitzva is to know that HaVaYaH (the Creator) is Elokim %0a> (Lord), as it is written; KNOW THIS DAY AND LAY IT IN YOUR HEART %0a> THAT HaVaYaH-CREATOR IS ELOKIM— LORD. That is, the name %0a> Elokim is included in the name of the HaVaYaH, and there is no distinction %0a> between them. %0a> %0a> HaVaYaH is ZA, and Elokim is Nukva de ZA. It is essential to unite ZA with %0a> Nukva by making their properties similar, so there is no distinction between %0a> them. Thus, the name Elokim of Nukt/a will be included in the name HaVaYaH %0a> of ZA, so that Nukva herself will become as HaVaYaH. %0a> %0a> This union signifies the reception of Ohr Hochma (GAR) in ZON, for the %0a> union implied by the words HEAR, O ISRAEL is the reception of the Light of %0a> VAK from AVI in ZON. The unity in question here is the reception from AVI in %0a> ZON of the Light of GAR (Hochma). One can never receive an entire degree in %0a> one go: first VAK is received, and only then GAR. %0a> %0a> 209. Hence, it is written, "Let the stars in Heaven shine upon the earth." %0a> This means that both names, HaVaYaH and ELOKIM, are as one. This way, %0a> Malchut (Elokim) should merge with the name HaVaYaH (ZA). The black Light %0a> (Malchut) with the white Light (ZA), as one, without distinction. The white %0a> cloud by day (ZA) with the pillar of fire by night (Malchut)', the property of day %0a> (ZA) merged with the property of night (Malchut), so they shine as one star. %0a> %0a> Nukva is called "a small star." Initially, there were two stars, ZA and Malchut, %0a> and both were the same size. But the moon (Malchut) complained that two stars %0a> cannot use one crown (source of Light). The Creator reply to Malchut was, "Go %0a> and diminish yourself (Talmud, Hulin, 60:2). %0a> %0a> As a result, the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut descended below the Parsa to %0a> the world of Beria, and only one Sefira, Keter de Malchut, remained in the world %0a> %0a> 399 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 400 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of Atzilut. The task of the righteous is to elevate the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut %0a> from the world of Beria to the level of ZA, to correct her distinction from ZA, %0a> i.e., to grow and make her equal to ZA once more, so she will make a Zivug with %0a> ZA face to face. Thus, they shall correct the detachment of Malchut from ZA that %0a> was born of the moon's complaint. %0a> %0a> The moon complained because it was unable to receive the Light directly %0a> from Ima, but only via ZA. Hence, the Creator gave it His advice: diminish %0a> yourself to a point (the Sefira Keter) and lower the nine Sefirot from Hochma to %0a> Malchut below the Parsa. Then, through the unity of "Hear, O Israel," rebuild %0a> Malchut in VAK, in the lower unity of "Blessed be His great name for ever and %0a> ever," for the power of judgment within it corrects the letter Dalet in the word %0a> Echad, turning the DRY LAND into the fruit-yielding EARTH. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the now black point of Malchut that caused its fall became as %0a> important as Light, for it is precisely the strictness of judgment that builds the %0a> letter Dalet in the word Echad and makes it fruit-bearing. And if Malchut had not %0a> had this power of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad (Tvuna) would %0a> have remained DRY LAND. Hence, when the Light spreads inside her, the %0a> power of judgment and restriction becomes more important than Light itself, %0a> for it becomes the cause, the source of the Light of VAK, Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Thus, it is now possible to receive Ohr Hochma in VAK de Malchut, while %0a> elevating ZON to AVI. For now, just like ZA, Nulcua can unite with AVI in her %0a> properties. This was the basis of her previous complaint, for the Light-restricting %0a> power within her turned into the cause of the Light's diffusion. Hence, ZA and %0a> Malchut are considered a single whole: each of them constitutes the source of %0a> Light for the other, whereas previously, Malchut was completely dependent on %0a> ZA, and therefore felt humiliated. %0a> %0a> As a result of the union between ZA and Nukva in AVI, ZA connects to Aba, %0a> and Nukva to Ima. ZA turns into white clouds in the daylight and Nukva turns %0a> into a pillar of fire in the Light of night, i.e., the properties of day and night %0a> merge into one property, as it is written: AND THERE WAS EVENING AND %0a> THERE WAS MORNING, ONE DAY. Together they illuminate the earth and %0a> those who inhabit Nukva in the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> 210. This is the sin of the primeval serpent that unites below but separates %0a> Above; hence, it caused what it caused to the world. What should be united %0a> Above, should be separated below. The black light, which is Malchut, %0a> should be united Above with ZA into a single whole and then separate it %0a> from the "evil side." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 401 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The union and fulfillment of ZON with Ohr Hochma occurs only when %0a> they ascend to AVI, above Chazeh de AA, where ZA merges with Aba and Nukva %0a> merges with Ima. As a result, they unite, and ZA passes Ohr Hochma to Malchut. %0a> However, in the permanent place of ZON, below Chazeh de AA, they cannot %0a> form a union and allow ~Nukva to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> This is exactly what provoked Adam's sin and allowed the Serpent to bring %0a> death into the world (cause the disappearance of Ohr Hochma from Malchut), by %0a> compelling Adam and Chava (Eve) to make a Zivug (union) in the permanent %0a> place of ZON, below Chazeh de AA. As a result, the Upper Zivug stopped in AVI, %0a> as ZA started passing Ohr Hochma from AVI down to Malchut. %0a> %0a> Thus, all the parts (souls) of Malchut existing in the world stopped receiving %0a> Ohr Hochma from AVI. This is regarded as death, for as soon as the impure forces %0a> approach ZON to draw their Ohr Hochma, AVI immediately terminate their Zivug %0a> for the sake of ZON, to prevent the impure force from clinging to ZON. And as %0a> soon as Ohr Hochma departs from ZON, the impure force leaves them at once, %0a> for it approaches ZON with the sole purpose of feeding on Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> However, after being in Ima and receiving Ohr Hochma, Malchut descends to %0a> her permanent place and passes this Light to the souls of the righteous, called %0a> the "inhabitants of Malchut." She unites with them via equivalence of their %0a> properties, for in the absence of unity with ZA below, Malchut draws far from %0a> the evil side and the impure forces cannot receive from her. %0a> %0a> 211. Nevertheless, one should know that Elokim and HaVaYaH are one, %0a> without distinction. HaVaYaH is Elokim. If man knows that all is one and %0a> does not cause any separation, then even the opposite, impure forces disappear %0a> from the world, instead of descending below. %0a> %0a> Although there is fear that a Zivug will occur in ZON in their place below, %0a> this is no cause to stop aspiring for a Zivug Above, in AVI. Moreover, one must %0a> attain that HaVaYaH is Elokim, which is achieved by uniting ZA with Nukva. %0a> And if man raises his MAN, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI and unite %0a> there, the impure forces are completely rejected by the Light, weaken and finally %0a> disappear from the world. %0a> %0a> 212. The secret behind the word h/le'orot, which consists of the words %0a> Mavet (death) and Ohr (Light), is that the impure forces follow knowledge, %0a> understanding, and thought. And this is Light, which is the opposite from %0a> death— Mavet, for the Light (Ohr) is inside death— Mavet (spelled as Me'ot) in %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 402 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the word ME'ohrOT. This alludes to the fact that Light separates death, but %0a> when Light disappears, the letters unite and form the word "death." %0a> %0a> The impure forces follow reason (knowledge, understanding, and thought). %0a> Reason signifies "Light," and the impure force is "death," where Light connects %0a> the letters, while death separates them. %0a> %0a> Here is the explanation of this: the power of restriction in Malchut is the %0a> source of the emergence of the impure forces. Because ZON united with AVI %0a> so as to receive the Light of VAK and GAR, the power of restriction in Malchut %0a> turned into Light by receiving the Light of VAK in the union below. Then, it %0a> ascended to AVI once more, and Malchut merged with ZA at the degree of AVI. %0a> %0a> This union Above is designated by the word Me'orot = Ohr + Mavet. As a %0a> result of the Light of VAK and GAR descending to Nukva in the union with ZA %0a> at the level of AVI, the power of restriction in Malchut turns into Light, and all %0a> the impure forces that were created by this restriction disappear, for their root %0a> turns to Light. Consequently, the letters of the word Mavet of the impure forces %0a> disappear, and the words Me'ohrot Ohr appear instead. %0a> %0a> 213. Chava started with these letters, and brought evil into the world. As it %0a> is written, the woman SAW that it was good to bring the letters of the word %0a> Me'ohrot back. From there she took the letters Vav-Tav-Reish-Aleph, leaving %0a> only the letters Mem and Vav. And they took with them the letter Tav, thus %0a> forming the word Mem- Vav- Tav (Mavet— death). And they brought death %0a> into the world. %0a> %0a> Thanks to the unity of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, designating the %0a> reception of Ohr Hochma in ZON, in the unity of ZON Above, the received Light %0a> separates the letters of Mavet in AVI, for it shines within them and forms a new %0a> combination of the letters Me'ohrot. And if ZON make a union below, at their %0a> permanent place, the Light disappears from the combination of letters Me'ohrot, %0a> and the word Mavet (death) remains. %0a> %0a> AND THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD (Beresheet, %0a> 3:6). The Hebrew equivalent for the words "and saw" is Vetir'e = Vav-Tav-Reish- %0a> Aleph. These are the letters that depart from the word Me'ohrot (stars), leaving %0a> only Mem- Vav. They attach the letter Tav (Nukva of the impure forces) and form %0a> the word Mavet— the name for Klipot. %0a> %0a> Chava drew these letters from the word Me'ohrot, meaning she followed the %0a> serpent's advice to unite ZON at their place below. In doing so, she violated %0a> the holy union of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, for the union of ZON below %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 403 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> immediately causes the separation of AVI and the word Me'ohrot into Ohr %0a> (Light) and Mavet (death). %0a> %0a> The impure forces, called "death," contain a male part, called "Sam," and a %0a> female part, called "Lilit." The letter Mem is the male part of the word MaveT, %0a> called "Sam," and the letter Tav is its female part, called "Lilit." Thus, there was %0a> a Zivug between the male and female parts, the letters Mem, Tav and Yesod (Vav), %0a> forming the word MaVeT, as the name of the impure force. %0a> %0a> This signifies the appearance of the serpent before Chava, and the %0a> transference of impurity from it to her. As she followed its advice, the letter Tav %0a> entered her, splitting the word Ohr (Light) and combining the letters into the %0a> word Vetir'e (AND SAW). Then, the male part of the impure force (Mem-Vat;) %0a> appeared and made a Zivug with Tav, which was already present in Chava; thus, %0a> death (MaVeT) appeared in the world. %0a> %0a> 214. And look: said Rabbi Elazar: "My father, I have learned that after Chava %0a> had removed the letters VeTiR'E from the word Me'ohrot, the letters Mem %0a> and Vav did not remain. Only the letter Mem remained, for the letter Vav, %0a> which is the letter of life, turned into death. This occurred because it attached %0a> the letter Tav to itself, thus forming the word MaVeT." He replied: "Blessed %0a> are you, my son!" %0a> %0a> Rabbi Elazar answered that the letter Mem remained alone, without the %0a> letter Vav, for Vav designates Yesod, whereas Sam (the male part of the impure %0a> forces) lacks Yesod; hence, it is written that it is unable to procreate offspring, %0a> akin to a castrated man. The letter Vav designates Yesod, the place of a Zivug, the %0a> union of the male and female parts of ZON. The letter Vav always designates %0a> life, Yesod of the pure forces, whose Zivug bears fruit, for it is made on the screen %0a> that stands in Yesod. %0a> %0a> Here, the pure letter Vav became impure and turned into Yesod of the impure %0a> force, MaVeT. After Vav received from Yesod of the pure forces, it united in a %0a> Zivug with Tav, and the word MaVeT was formed. This was precisely the sin of %0a> Adam, which defiled the pure Vav. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fifth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 215. The fifth Mitzva. It is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH %0a> SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES (Beresheet, 1:20). This verse contains %0a> three Mitzvot. The first is to study the Torah, the second is to procreate and %0a> multiply, and the third is to remove the foreskin on the eighth day. And it is %0a> necessary to study the Torah on all the days, at all times, in order to correct %0a> one's soul and spirit. %0a> %0a> The four previous Mitzvot originate in the first four days of creation, and are %0a> intended for the correction of the degrees H-B-ZA-M of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> The First Mitzva originates from the word BERESHEET (Bina, fear of the %0a> Great and Mighty Creator, who rules over all), referring only to GAR de Bina %0a> that is located in AVI. The position of AVI is from Peh to Chazeh de AA, Yod of %0a> the name HaVaYaH. %0a> %0a> The Second Mitzva originates from the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, %0a> and is meant for the correction of ZAT de Bina (called YESHSLT), located from %0a> Chazeh to Tahur de AA, i.e., below its Parsa. However, when it is said, LET THERE %0a> BE LIGHT, this means that YESHSLT ascended and united with AVI, forming %0a> one Partzuf above Chazeh de AA. And from there they ascended to Rosh de AA. %0a> %0a> Such a state (degree) is called "Great love," designated by the first letter %0a> (Hey) of the name HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey, and the Light passes from it to %0a> ZON. However, ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, for they are GAR de %0a> Bina and will always remain only with Ohr Hassadim, unwilling to receive, hence %0a> their name, "fear." %0a> %0a> ZON, however, receive Ohr Hochma from ZAT de Bina (YESHSLT), which %0a> ascended above Parsa de AA, called "Great love." However, YESHSLT, which %0a> stand below Parsa de AA, cannot pass Ohr Hochma to ZA, for Ohr Hochma is %0a> concealed within them. Also, their Tvuna is called DRY LAND. %0a> %0a> 405 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 406 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Third Mitzva originates from the two stars that were created on the %0a> third day of creation, of which it is written: LET THE WATERS UNDER THE %0a> HEAVENS BE GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE, AND LET %0a> THE DRY LAND APPEAR... and LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH GRASS. %0a> This Mitzva is intended for the correction of VAK de ZON, whose union Above %0a> stems from the verse, LET THE WATERS, referring to ZA, whereas the union %0a> below stems from the verse, LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS, and %0a> refers to VAK de Nukva. %0a> %0a> The Fourth Mitzva originates from the verse, LET THE STARS, and is %0a> meant for the correction of GAR in ZA and Malchut. Thus, all the corrections %0a> necessary for AVI, YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut have already taken place in the %0a> first four days of creation. ZON received GAR (Ohr Hochma), and, being of equal %0a> height, can now make a Zivug face to face. Therefore, the rest of the Mitzvot are %0a> intended for this Zivug of ZON. %0a> %0a> The Fifth Mitzva is LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a> LIVING CREATURES. Now there is a need to bring ZON to a perfect face-to- %0a> face Zivug, i.e., (i) to receive Ohr Neshama onto this Zivug, so that Adam, too, %0a> will receive this Light and make a holy and pure Zivug, which is attained by %0a> man's efforts in the study of the Torah; (ii) to give birth to holy souls; and (iii) %0a> to correct the holy covenant by circumcision and rejection. %0a> %0a> Man's efforts lie in that he studies the Torah, although he realizes that he %0a> does not attain it (receives nothing in his corrected desires, called Guf, body). He %0a> merely utters its words with his "mouth" (not yet able to receive the Light (Torah) %0a> in his body for the Creator's sake), but as a result, he attains Ohr Nefesh. %0a> %0a> Man's efforts should correspond to his readiness to do everything in his %0a> power to attain and understand the Torah, which causes him to attain Ohr %0a> Ruach. However, he must not limit himself to such attainments, but rather %0a> multiply his efforts so as to attain Ohr Neshama. Thus, every day he must aspire %0a> to correct his Nefesh and Ruach, and by increasing them, attain Neshama. %0a> %0a> 216. Because man labors in the study of the Torah, he corrects the other holy %0a> soul, as it is written, SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES, referring to the %0a> life-giving holy soul, Malchut. For when man does not study the Torah, he %0a> lacks the holy soul and the holiness that descends from Above. Yet, when he %0a> does study the Torah, he merits its Light, just like holy angels. %0a> %0a> Nukva de ZA that makes a face-to-face Zivug with ZA in the state of Gadlut is %0a> called "living," for ZA is then called the "Tree of Life." Consequently, Nukva is %0a> called "Life." By raising MAN during the study of Torah for the Creator's sake, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fifth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 407 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> man causes ZON to make a Zivug and receives Ohr Ne/esh from it. And if he does %0a> not study the Torah for the Creator's sake, he cannot even attain Ohr Ne/esh, for %0a> he fails to bring about the Creator's Zivug with the Shechina. And a Zivug can be %0a> attained only by raising MAN. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a> LIVING CREATURES, for the Torah is called "water." If man raises MAN with %0a> the help of the Torah, he merits Ohr Ne/esh (holy spirit) from Ohr Haya (Life). %0a> Moreover, he merges with the Creator only after he attains Ne/esh, Ruach, and %0a> Neshama from HAYA (Supernal holy life). He unites Ohr Ne/esh with Ohr Ruach, %0a> Ohr Ruach with Ohr Neshama, and Ohr Neshama with the Creator. %0a> %0a> 217. It is written, "Angels of the Creator shall bless Him." This refers to those %0a> who study the Torah, as they are called His angels on earth. It is also written, %0a> BIRDS SOARING OVER THE EARTH. This refers to this world. However, %0a> in the world to come, as it is said, the Creator will make them wings like those %0a> of an eagle so they may soar in the whole world. %0a> %0a> Why does The Zohar mention angels? Because angels are spiritual forces- %0a> mechanical enactors of the Creator's will. They were repeatedly compared to %0a> animals in our world (e.g., a horse) that fulfill man's will. Angels are spiritual %0a> forces without freedom or egoism; hence, they never sin and have no need for %0a> the Torah, which is why they are spiritually inanimate, motionless— they do not %0a> grow spiritually. %0a> %0a> Man is created in such a way that before he carries out any task, he needs to %0a> realize what he is supposed to do. But angels carry out their assignments even %0a> before they hear and understand what the Creator wants from them, for His %0a> desire rules over them. Hence, nothing prevents them from instant fulfillment %0a> of His will. They always follow the Creator, just like man's shadow follows him. %0a> This is why they are believed to act before they even hear. %0a> %0a> Man can therefore act like an angel (even though his desires are of egoistic %0a> nature) if his desires become like those of angels, whose actions precede their %0a> understanding (hearing). Just like an angel, such a person fulfills all the Creator's %0a> desires before he realizes, hears and understands them, for he follows the Creator %0a> as a shadow follows man. %0a> %0a> This can be illustrated by the following example: when a strong wind throws %0a> dust in one's eyes, he quickly shuts them, even before his brain and thoughts %0a> feel and realize the need to do so: the action (shutting the eyes) precedes the %0a> actual realization of the thought of dust. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 408 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Although the physical body of such a person exists together with us in this %0a> world, his spiritual body (desires) becomes angel-like, and his actions precede %0a> his hearing. He does not need to hear in order to fulfill the Creator's will, but %0a> observes any Mitzva even before his brain realizes what he is doing. Therefore, %0a> he is regarded as an angel. %0a> %0a> Hence, The Zohar says that in the future the Creator will provide him with %0a> wings to enable him to soar over the whole world. For until man attains the holy %0a> soul (Ohr Ne/esh— the smallest spiritual Light), the impure force rules over him, %0a> as the prophet said: "The souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from %0a> the hollow of a sling" (Shmuel I, 25:29). %0a> %0a> Hence, one cannot merge with the Creator and observe His desires (Mitzvot) %0a> until he has acquired faith in the Creator's names and knows that He is absolutely %0a> good to all and bestows only goodness. And if one has not yet attained the holy %0a> soul, and the impure force still rules over him, when his thoughts soar above %0a> the world, it seems to him as though the Creator's rule is not quite as good as it %0a> should be according to His names. This feeling of his brings corruption to the %0a> Creator's holy names, and he cannot find a quiet place for himself, cannot have %0a> faith in His names and draw closer to Him. %0a> %0a> Therefore, he stains himself with such impurity that it leads him toward %0a> lack of faith in the Creator and in His names. However, nothing of this affects %0a> the spiritual; it occurs simply because man has not yet attained the spiritual %0a> realm, and is making no effort to do so. %0a> %0a> But as soon as he receives the holy soul (Ohr Ne/esh), his body (desires and %0a> thoughts) instantly becomes angel-like: his actions precede realization. It is written %0a> about such a person: "And the birds shall soar above the earth," for in the future, %0a> the Creator will give him wings, and he will soar above the whole world. %0a> %0a> For he soars mentally above the whole world and sees how the Creator %0a> governs all. Yet, not only does he not err when seeing the manifestation of this %0a> governance, he receives the strength to raise MAN to increase his spiritual anti- %0a> egoistic powers. By looking upon all the forms of the Creator's rule over this %0a> world and, seeing the harshness of the external manifestations of this rule, such %0a> a person is given an opportunity to ask for the strengthening of his faith. And %0a> owing to his faith in the Creator's unity and absolute kindness of His rule, he %0a> raises MAN and receives increasingly greater Light for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> 218. It is written in this regard: LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, %0a> for the Torah, called THE WATERS, will SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a> LIVING CREATURES from its place of life, Malchut, and all will descend %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fifth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 409 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> down below. This is what King David referred to, when he said, THE %0a> CREATOR CREATED IN ME A PURE HEART to study The Torah, and %0a> A HOLY SPIRIT WAS RENEWED WITHIN ME. %0a> %0a> So as to continue to explain the aforementioned text, The Zohar compares %0a> the Torah to water— just as living creatures emerged from water, in the same %0a> way the Light of life descends from Malchut (called "life") upon the entire %0a> world. This is the Light for which King David asked the Creator. He begged %0a> for a pure heart in order to study the Torah and raise MAN, for this would %0a> lead him to the reception of the holy spirit of renewal— the strength to merge %0a> with the Creator even more. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Sixth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 219. The sixth Mitzva is to procreate and multiply, for he who does so turns %0a> the stream, called Yesod de ZA, into an inexhaustible fountain. And the sea, %0a> Malchut, shall be filled from all directions, and new souls shall come forth %0a> from that tree, and a multitude of forces shall appear together with those %0a> souls, to guard them. Hence, it is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM %0a> WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES. This is the mark of the holy %0a> Covenant. The stream grows stronger, turns into a river, and thus brings more %0a> and more new souls to life. %0a> %0a> An awakening from below causes an awakening from Above: raising MAN, %0a> the prayers and requests of the lower ones to receive strength so they can perform %0a> spiritual, altruistic actions, stimulate a Zivug Above between the Creator and the %0a> Shechina. As a result, the stream, Yesod de ZA, fills with water and descends to %0a> Nukva de ZA, filling her on all sides, wishing to both revive all the worlds (to %0a> bestow Ohr Hassadim) and bear new souls (pass Ohr Hochma downward, for birth %0a> is possible only in Ohr Hochma). %0a> %0a> There are two kinds of Zivugim de ZON: (i) a "Zivug of existence" on Ohr %0a> Hassadim, from which Ohr Hassadim descends to provide the lower souls with %0a> what they need for their existence. This Zivug on Ohr Hassadim also gives birth %0a> to angels, (ii) A "Zivug of birth" on Ohr Hochma, which leads to the creation of %0a> new Partzufim, new human souls. %0a> %0a> These new souls emerge from the Tree (ZA). However, although they are %0a> called new, the genuinely new souls originate in the world of Ein Sof (Infinity), %0a> whereas these souls were already within Adam, and fell into the impure forces %0a> as a result of his sin. Now they are revived with the help of the Tree of Life (ZA); %0a> hence, they are called "new souls." A multitude of other forces, called Heavenly %0a> %0a> 411 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 412 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> hosts or armies, descends along with them. But completely new souls descend to %0a> the world only after the correction of Adam's sin has been completed. %0a> %0a> Yesod de ZA is called a "covenant," because we (Malchut, souls) feel and %0a> receive from it all the Light of our life. It constitutes the source of our life, %0a> descending to us from the Tree of Life (ZA). ZA ascends to AVI (called "garden") %0a> in order to take the waters from them and fill Malchut, his Nukva. A Zivug on %0a> VAK {Hassadim) is called WATERS SWARM, and a Zivug on GAR {Hochma) is %0a> called LIVING CREATURES. %0a> %0a> 220. A number of birds (angels) that soar above the whole world enter %0a> Malchut along with those souls. When a soul comes into this world, the bird %0a> that came from that tree along with that soul accompanies it. How many %0a> angels leave with each soul? Two: one on the right, and one on the left. If %0a> one so merits, they guard him, as it is written: FOR HE WILL GIVE HIS %0a> ANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU. Yet, if he does not merit, they report and %0a> accuse him. Rabbi Pinchas said: "There are three angels that guard man, %0a> if he so merits, as it is written, IF THERE BE AN ANGEL OVER HIM, %0a> A DEFENDER, ONE AMONG A THOUSAND THAT WARNS MAN. If %0a> there be an ANGEL— is the first; A DEFENDER— is the second; one among a %0a> thousand THAT WARNS man-is the third." %0a> %0a> 221. Rabbi Shimon said: "In all, there are five angels, for the verse continues: %0a> 'there is one after the giver and two more, so in all there are five.'" He replied: %0a> "This is not so. 'The giver' refers solely to the Creator Himself, and not to an %0a> angel, for only the Creator is permitted to give, but no one else." %0a> %0a> A number of angels come forth together with the begotten souls. These %0a> angels are called "soaring" or "flying." They help the souls to sentence to the %0a> scale of merit, or, conversely, complain to the Creator about these souls, and %0a> push them toward the scale of sin, which entails punishments. These angels soar %0a> above the world, see how the Creator rules over all, and report all this to the %0a> soul. If the soul so merits, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of %0a> merit; if not, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of sin. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Rabbi Pinchas does not dispute Rabbi Shimon when he says %0a> that only two angels are born with a soul. Rather, he says that as long as there %0a> are only two angels in man, he cannot sentence to the scale of merit completely, %0a> and keeps moving between the scales of sin (punishment) and merit (reward). %0a> However, through one's good deeds, the third angel is born within him, which %0a> enables man to sentence everything to the scale of merit. Hence, only with the %0a> help of the three angels can he achieve his correction. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Sixth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 413 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 222. And he who abstains from procreating and multiplying belittles (so to %0a> speak) the form that includes all other forms, the form of man, causes that %0a> stream, Yesod of ZA, to dry out, and harms the holy Covenant (Yesod of %0a> ZA) from all sides. It is written of such a man, "Go forth and look upon %0a> the corpses of those that have transgressed against the Creator." Of course, %0a> those who transgress against Me. This is said about the body, as the soul never %0a> even enters the screen, i.e., the Creator's domain. And such a man shall be %0a> banished from the world. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called a "form," a "property" that contains all of the other %0a> properties, for all the forms of NRN of the righteous and of the angels in the %0a> three worlds of BYA originate from her. They constitute all the hosts and armies. %0a> And those that do not procreate and multiply thereby diminish the form of %0a> Malchut and prevent her from using all of her hosts and armies. For with the %0a> help of MAN that the lower ones raise, the Light descends from Above and %0a> stimulates a Zivug between the Creator and the Shechina. This Zivug creates %0a> NRN— the souls of the righteous and the angels in the worlds of BYA. %0a> %0a> And those that impede this Zivug cause the stream (Yesod of ZA) to dry out %0a> and stop the flow of its male waters into the holy Shechina, Malchut. In doing so, %0a> they harm the holy covenant in all of its properties, for they delay the two parts %0a> of the Zivug: VAK (on Ohr Hassadim) and GAR (on Ohr Hochma). %0a> %0a> This is because the Mitzva of procreation and multiplication constantly %0a> develops the soul. As a result, man defeats his body forever, so it can rise again %0a> during the resurrection from the dead. And he who abstains from procreating %0a> and multiplying turns his body into a corpse, of which it is written: GO FORTH %0a> AND LOOK UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE, for his soul will not %0a> be able to enter the Creator's domain and merge with Him. Thus, he is rejected %0a> from the world to come. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Seventh Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 223. The seventh Mitzva is to perform circumcision on the eighth day, and thus %0a> remove the impurity of the foreskin, for Malchut constitutes the eighth degree %0a> of all the degrees, beginning with Bina. And the soul that soars from her must %0a> appear before her on the eighth day; hence, she constitutes the eighth degree. %0a> %0a> Nukva de ZA is called Haya if she rises and clothes Ima-Bina, the eighth %0a> degree from Malchut (provided that you count all ten Sefirot from below upwards). %0a> Malchut is hence called "the eighth," for she ascended eight degrees, from her %0a> own place to that of Bina. And when she reaches Bina, she receives the name %0a> Haya, just like Bina. %0a> %0a> Therefore, man's soul, which is born in Malchut (that ascended to Bina), %0a> must appear before Malchut in all the appropriate corrections of circumcision, %0a> removal of the foreskin and the rolling up of its remains, on the eighth day from %0a> its birth in Malchut. This is because then it becomes clear that it is a soul that %0a> was born from none other than the holy degree of Haya. %0a> %0a> Because of the force of circumcision and rolling up, man's soul sloughs the %0a> impure force, and the soul can receive the perfection of Ohr Haya. LET THE %0a> WATERS SWARM— thus Malchut receives the Supernal male waters from ZON, %0a> and is filled with them. %0a> %0a> 224. It then becomes clear that the type of this soul is Haya. That is, belonging %0a> to that holy degree of Haya (Malchut), and not to any other degree. And this %0a> is implied by, LET THE WATERS SWARM, as is explained in the book of %0a> Hanoch, the waters of the holy seed merge in the properties of the soul of %0a> Haya. And it is the property of the letter Yod, marked on the sacred flesh, %0a> more than any other mark that exists in the world. %0a> %0a> Because of the circumcision, the Supernal male waters fill man's soul the %0a> way they were received in Nukva (called "the soul of Haya"). The Upper World, %0a> %0a> 415 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 416 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> called Bina, is designated by the letter Yod, and the lower world, Malchut, is %0a> designated by the letter Hey— its property. However, as Malchut ascends to Bina, %0a> the letter Hey disappears from her, and, just like Bina, turns into Yod. %0a> %0a> Similarly, through man's observance of the Mitzva of spiritual circumcision, %0a> the letter Hey disappears, and just like in the Nukva that ascended to Bina, the %0a> property of the letter Yod appears in him instead. And if man's body acquires the %0a> property of Yod, he can receive the soul of Haya from Nukva. %0a> %0a> 225. The verse, LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, refers to Eliyahu, %0a> who flies across the whole world in four flights in order to be present in the %0a> place, where the Holy Covenant is made. And a chair must be prepared for %0a> him, and it must be said out loud, THIS IS THE CHAIR OF ELIYAHU. For %0a> this is not done so, he will not appear in that place. %0a> %0a> Angels originate from AVI; hence, they remain exclusively in the sky and %0a> consist of HGT NHY Therefore, when they appear in this world to fulfill their %0a> tasks, they are said to make six flights, for they clothe in six Sefirot. %0a> %0a> However, Eliyahu stems from Malchut (not from AVI). Hence, he is %0a> constantly connected to the earth. And since Malchut contains only four Sefirot %0a> of ZA, for her position is parallel to the Sefirot TNHY (Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod, %0a> pronounced, Tanhi) from Chazeh de ZA downward, it is written that Eliyahu %0a> flies on four flights, i.e., by clothing in Sefirot TNHY. %0a> %0a> Under no circumstances should one interpret the words about Eliyahu's %0a> presence at every rite of circumcision literally. Yet, if he is obliged to be there, %0a> why should he be invited? %0a> %0a> The Zohar explains this in another place (Shlach, 18): there are four impure %0a> forces, called "Stormy Wind," "Great Cloud," "Blazing Flame," and Noga. The %0a> lowest of them, Stormy Wind, is at the center, as though clothed by Great %0a> Cloud, which is in turn clothed by Blazing Flame. And they are all clothed from %0a> the outside by Noga. %0a> %0a> All the worlds, forces, and everything that was ever created exists within man. %0a> And these are our spiritual forces, by which we can attain the goal of creation. %0a> The first three impure forces are completely impure (egoistic). Whereas ~Noga is %0a> half good and half evil. But how is that possible if the spiritual is always true? %0a> How can it be half good (altruistic) and half evil (egoistic) at the same time? %0a> %0a> In fact, this is impossible. Noga is a neutral force that can be used by the %0a> pure force (then Noga is considered good) or by the impure force (and then it %0a> is considered evil). Hence, Noga is called "half good and half evil" although %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Seventh Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 417 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> neutral in itself. It may be attached to either pure or impure forces, and this %0a> depends entirely on man. %0a> %0a> MAN'S SPIRITUAL FORCES %0a> Pure - altruistic %0a> %0a> Noga - neutral %0a> %0a> Blazing Flame - egoistic %0a> Great Cloud - egoistic %0a> Stormy Wind - egoistic %0a> %0a> These four impure forces are located at the end of each spiritual Partzuf, in %0a> its Sefira Yesod. The Sefira Yesod has two layers of skin, one atop of the other. One %0a> layer is called Orla, and contains the three impure forces. The other is called %0a> Preia, and this is Noga. %0a> %0a> The first man, Adam, was born circumcised, meaning that he did not %0a> have the three impure forces at all— he was completely unaware of his egoistic %0a> desires. In other words, they could not cling to him. Noga prevailed in him, %0a> in his sensations. Yet, since it was separated from the three impure forces and %0a> attached to the pure force (Adam's altruistic desires), Noga itself was considered %0a> completely good. %0a> %0a> The three impure forces are collectively called the Serpent. These three %0a> impure desires were roused in Adam and tempted him to use them. In so doing, %0a> Adam attracted the Orla to himself, as it is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, %0a> 38:2). As soon as he attached Orla to himself, his pure soul (the Light of the %0a> world of Atzilut) immediately disappeared, for his desires became egoistic, and %0a> he fell with his properties (desires) to the world of Assiya, to its lowest degree, %0a> called "this world," and was condemned to death (disappearance of the Supernal %0a> spiritual Light). %0a> %0a> Therefore, it is written about him that since he violated the prohibition of %0a> not eating the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge, he attached the Orla to himself. %0a> Consequently, the impure desires acquired both layers of skin on the Sefira %0a> Yesod of Partzuf Adam, and Preia, called Noga, became impure, too, because %0a> of its contact with the Orla, with the three impure forces. However, there is a %0a> distinction between them, which lies in the fact that prior to Adam's sin, Preia %0a> was pure, and all of its impurity stems from its contact with the Orla. %0a> %0a> Accordingly, there are two types of correction: circumcision and rolling up %0a> of the remaining skin. The Orla must be cut off and cast in the dust, since only %0a> thus can man free himself from these egoistic desires. Preia, however, can be left %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 418 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> attached to Yesod. But the skin around the Sefira Yesod must be rolled up. This %0a> is a special spiritual action that frees the Preia from the impure forces remaining %0a> in it. Hence, this action causes the Light to return to the Partzuf. This Light %0a> previously disappeared because of the egoistic desires that ruled in the Partzuf %0a> before the spiritual circumcision took place. %0a> %0a> However, this is still insufficient for the fulfillment of the spiritual Partzuf, %0a> Adam, with the Light, as it was before he sinned, i.e. used the Serpent's impure %0a> forces and tasted the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge (received Ohr %0a> Hochma in egoistic desires). For now, after Adam's sin and fall, a special angel by %0a> the name of SAM makes accusations and complaints against man. %0a> %0a> To neutralize the power of SAM, Eliyahu took upon himself his role of a %0a> prosecutor, and was thereby granted an opportunity to defend Israel (one who %0a> aspires to the Creator) when he circumcises himself (his egoistic desires). %0a> %0a> Hence, it is said that Eliyahu must be present at each rite of circumcision %0a> (Hebrew, Brit Mila— the Covenant with the Creator). For since it is he, rather than %0a> SAM, who complains to the Creator about Israel's neglect of their Covenant, he %0a> can also testify that when Israel aspires to the Creator, it is loyal to the covenant. %0a> As a result, the Light returns to the Partzuf. %0a> %0a> This is why, besides the chair occupied by the man who holds the baby %0a> (Sanda/c-godfather), one more chair must be prepared for the prophet Eliyahu. %0a> For the chair designates the beginning of correction, the influence of the Upper %0a> One on the lower one. The first chair, on which the Sandak sits, belongs to %0a> the Creator, for the filling of Light as the result of the circumcision and the %0a> rolling up of the impure forces. The second chair is saved for Eliyahu, so he can %0a> neutralize the impure forces' complaints to the Creator against man, so they %0a> would not be able to accuse man. %0a> %0a> However, to make Eliyahu appear, one must say out loud: THIS IS THE %0a> CHAIR OF ELIYAHU. The thing is that a male baby is circumcised on the %0a> eighth day after Shabbat (Malchut with the Light of AVI, called "holy") has passed %0a> over him. Since the sloughed desires (Orla) are cast away, the impure force sees %0a> that it is given a part of the Creator's Covenant. Because of this gift, it stops %0a> complaining and accusing man. On the contrary, it begins to advocate him %0a> before the Creator. %0a> %0a> The spiritual desires (objects) pass their properties from one to another. %0a> Since the Orla was attached to Yesod, after the circumcision (separation from %0a> Yesod) it takes part of the pure desires with it. And since we throw it to the dust, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Seventh Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 419 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to the impure forces, they draw from it that weak Light, which they can receive %0a> from the circumcision and the rolling up. %0a> %0a> This is why the impure forces stop complaining against Israel, and no longer %0a> wish to destroy this Light, for in so doing they will lose the part that they draw %0a> from it. Thus, they become defenders of the pure forces, to allow the pure forces %0a> to be filled with Light. %0a> %0a> Yet, Eliyahu cannot bear this correction, for although the Klipa stops %0a> impeding and slandering Israel, it takes part of the Light for itself in return. To %0a> correct this, Eliyahu takes upon himself all the accusations against Israel, and %0a> refuses to give anything from the pure to the impure forces. %0a> %0a> Thus, although the impure force stopped complaining against Israel, and %0a> actually became its defender, Eliyahu himself continues to accuse in order to %0a> wrest all the power from the impure forces and fully separate them from the %0a> pure. Hence, a chair must be prepared for Eliyahu, for it is he who fully separates %0a> the impure forces from the pure ones. %0a> %0a> One must therefore verbalize the words: THIS IS THE CHAIR OF %0a> ELIYAHU. For after the circumcision, part of the Light still remains in the %0a> impure forces, and the mention of Eliyahu completely deprives them of any %0a> contact with the Light. %0a> %0a> Thus, if man does not express his desire to detach himself completely from %0a> the impure forces, through his own effort (by the screen positioned in Peh), it %0a> does not happen, even though the first chair belongs to the Creator. This is %0a> because the Creator starts the process of creation (makes His foundation in %0a> the form of a chair), and man continues and corrects his nature by performing %0a> altruistic deeds. %0a> %0a> 226. And the Creator created great Leviathans. They were two: Orla and %0a> Preia, male and female forces, and all living creatures. This is the mark of %0a> the Holy Covenant, the soul of the holy Ohr Haya, as it is written, LET THE %0a> WATERS SWARM, the Supernal Waters that descend to this Covenant. %0a> %0a> Leviathan and his wife designate that which is opposite from Orla and Preia. %0a> They are also called Nachash (Serpent) and Alcaton (his wife). Orla is the Serpent, %0a> and Nachash is the male part that must be cut off and committed to dust. Preia %0a> is the correction, liberation from the Serpent's female part, Alcaton. Through %0a> these corrections, Ohr Haya of AVI descends from Above. %0a> %0a> 227. The reason why Israel below is marked in the holy form, similar to its %0a> form from Above, is to separate the pure part from the impure, to distinguish %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 420 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> between the holiness of Israel and the other nations that originate from the %0a> other side. And just as Israel was marked, so were the animals and birds— to %0a> determine which of them belong to Israel, and which belong to the nations of %0a> the world. Happy is the lot of Israel! %0a> %0a> Man's attitude toward all the living creatures in our world is similar to the %0a> attitude of the general spiritual creation, called "man," toward his parts. This %0a> is because Adam includes absolutely everything within his spiritual body. And %0a> e is nothing except for this spiritual Partzuf, called "man" or "Adam." %0a> %0a> 1 spiritual objects, angels, souls, both pure and impure forces are part %0a> 's body. All that is described in Kabbalah speaks only of the spirit %0a> world, of one creature called "man," Adam. Adam's various parts, his varic %0a> desires— are called "Israe %0a> animals," and so forth. %0a> %0a> All that man must do in our world (for every one of us was created in the %0a> image of Adam, recreating Adam's entire Partzuf within him) is build a pure, %0a> ruistic Partzuf within him. This is done by cutting off all of the egoistic desires %0a> arating the pure from the impure in all his desires, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Eighth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 228. The eighth Mitzva is to love an outsider from another nation, who desires %0a> to come under the wings of the Shechina, M.alchut, who takes under her %0a> wings those who separate themselves from the other, impure side, and draw %0a> near her, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH A LIVING %0a> SOUL AFTER ITS KIND. %0a> %0a> Malchut, Nukva de ZA, is called the Shechina, for she does not distance from %0a> us even when our properties are distant from her, as it is said: WHEREVER %0a> YOU ARE BANISHED, THE SHECHINA WILL BE WITH YOU, and %0a> ABIDES IN THEM, IN THEIR IMPURITY. ZA is called Shochen (dweller) and %0a> Nulcva is called Shechina. %0a> %0a> The revelation of the Creator in Malchut, of the Shochen in the Shechina, of %0a> ZA in Malchut of the world of Atzilut is possible only by a face-to-face Zivug of %0a> ZON in Gadlut. This is because the Light of this Zivug is so great that it reveals %0a> unity even in the most remote and concealed places, in the most opposite and %0a> uncorrected desires. %0a> %0a> However, the creation of Gadlut de ZON occurs gradually: first, a Partzuf %0a> of ZON in Katnut is created with the Light of VAK, and only then does it %0a> grow to reach Gadlut. Moreover, this process takes place in each state of ZON. %0a> Furthermore, even as ZON in Gadlut make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma, the %0a> Light from their previous state of Katnut does not disappear, but facilitates a %0a> Zivug in Gadlut. And this Light of Katnut is called the "Wings of Shechina." %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And the cherubim shall spread out their %0a> wings on High, screening the ark-cover with their wings" (Shemot, 25:20). For the %0a> main thing is to cover the Light of the great Zivug with their wings, so that even %0a> the most distant ones would receive the Light, and, at the same time, keep it out %0a> of the reach of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> 421 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 422 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This is so because those who have yet to completely purify their egoistic %0a> desires are rejected by the Light for fear that the Light may fall to the impure %0a> forces. But now the wings guard the Light so vigilantly that even the closest ones %0a> will not err and let the Light through to the impure forces. %0a> %0a> Therefore, an outsider is one who decides to join the people of Israel (to %0a> correct his egoistic desires and make them altruistic), and to be circumcised %0a> (reject his egoistic desires), for his body (collection of desires) still retains the %0a> properties of the Orla, as his ancestors (previous spiritual states) did not stand %0a> at the foot of Mount Sinai (did not receive the Light, called the Torah, and were %0a> not corrected by it), i.e., have not yet rid themselves of the serpent's impurity %0a> (have neither revealed all the impure egoistic desires within them nor recognized %0a> them as evil). Nevertheless, other altruistic desires have the power to elevate him %0a> to the level of Supernal purity. %0a> %0a> This occurs through raising MAN, by evoking the great Zivug of ZON (where %0a> the Wings of Shechina rule and cover the Light of this Zivug). We can also elevate %0a> the outsider's soul (his yet uncorrected desires) to that level and sanctify it in the %0a> Light of this Zivug. %0a> %0a> And although this soul is not yet completely pure, it can receive the Light %0a> from this Zivug, for the wings protect it and do not allow its Light through %0a> to the impure forces (desires), even though they are very close to it. And it %0a> is said, UNDER THE WINGS OF SHECHINA, for this soul can receive the %0a> Light only from the wings of Malchut-Shechina, i.e., receive only the small, %0a> outer Light of Malchut. This is not the Light in the body of Malchut (Shechina) %0a> herself, let alone that of ZA (the Creator, Shochen). Rather, it is merely the %0a> Light of the Wings of Shechina. %0a> %0a> The outsider's soul (his egoistic desires) can be corrected (made altruistic) %0a> only during the great Zivug, for only then is the Light protected by the Wings %0a> of Shechina. Hence, we (altruistic desires) must first raise MAN for the great %0a> Zivug, and receive its Light in our souls (desires corrected by the screen). Then, %0a> the Shechina spreads her wings, protects this Zivug, and takes the outsider's soul %0a> under them. It follows that initially, we elevate the outsider's soul with the help %0a> of our MAN, and then the Shechina takes it under her wings. %0a> %0a> 229. One might say that the soul of Haya exists in Israel and is ready for %0a> anything. He specified, "After its kind," which refers to both Israel and to an %0a> outsider. Like chambers and passages between them, the same exists in the %0a> land called Haya, under the wings. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Eighth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 423 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar tells us that although the new soul (the corrected properties %0a> called the "outsider") receives the Light, just like the properties called "Israel," %0a> Israel receives from the inner Light, whereas the outsider receives from the %0a> outer. It was already mentioned that wings designate the Light of VAK, received %0a> during the great Zivug, but from the previous state of Katnut, so as to cover the %0a> Light of the great Zivug. %0a> %0a> This VAK includes Sefirot HGT NHY, where HGT are called "chambers," in %0a> which one can abide and sit (sitting means Katnut as opposed to standing, which %0a> is Gadlut). The Sefirot NHY are called "passages," entrances to the chambers, and %0a> it is impossible to sit there; their only role is to allow access to the chambers. %0a> %0a> The reason for this lies in the property of Tifferet, the main Sefira in HGT. %0a> Tifferet is their middle line, a complete Kli for the reception of Ohr Hassadim. %0a> And the main Sefira in NHY is Yesod, which constitutes their middle line. It %0a> contains no property of the receiving Kli, and is used only for passing the %0a> Light onto Malchut, for the creation of the Returning Light. Hence, NHY are %0a> called "entrances." %0a> %0a> As for the outsiders (to purify from egoistic desires) from the seventy nations %0a> of the world (seventy egoistic properties), the chambers in HGT of the wings, %0a> as well as the passages in NHY of the wings are prepared for them. They receive %0a> Ohr Ne/esh from the passages (NHY) and Ohr Ruach from the chambers (HGT). %0a> %0a> 230. The right wing of Malchut has two passages, which are split from this %0a> wing in two so as to let in two nations that are close to Israel. And under the %0a> left wing there are two additional passages, called Amon and Moav. And they %0a> are all called the souls of Haya. %0a> %0a> Previously, The Zohar mentioned that there are many entrances-passages, %0a> yet now it speaks of only two. This is because it speaks in general: there are two %0a> entrances for the nations belonging to the right line, and two entrances for the %0a> nations belonging to the left line. There are also two nations in all of the right %0a> line, which include all the nations of the right side, and there are two nations of %0a> the left line, which include all the nations of the left side. %0a> %0a> The nations of the right side refer to the two general passages in the right %0a> wing. And The Zohar does not reveal what these nations are. And as for the %0a> nations of the left side, generally called "Amon and Moav," there are two passages %0a> in the left wing that are meant for them. %0a> %0a> All the souls of the outsiders that come from all the nations are collectively %0a> called Ne/esh Ha^a, for they can receive only from the great Zivug of ZON when %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 424 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZON are inside AVI. Thus, Malchut is called Nefesh Haya, for she receives Ohr %0a> Haya from AVI. And since the souls (Nefashot) of the outsiders receive from the %0a> wings of Nefesh Haya, they are named after the received Light. %0a> %0a> 231. Each wing contains a multitude of closed chambers and halls. From %0a> them, spirits emerge and are divided among all the outsiders, called Ne/esH %0a> Haya, but each "after his kind." And they all come under the wings of the %0a> Shechina, but no further. %0a> %0a> Each wing includes VAK (HGT NHY), called "passages" and "chambers." %0a> Each nation has its own chamber in HGT and its own passage in NHY. Each %0a> receives Ne/esh in the passages and Ruach in the chambers. It is written that the %0a> chambers are closed, since HGT de VAK have only Ohr Hassadim without any %0a> Ohr Hochma; hence, they are called "closed." %0a> %0a> 232. However, the soul of Israel stems from the body of that tree (ZA), and %0a> from there the souls fly off to this land (Malchut). Therefore, Israel is the %0a> darling son of Malchut, and is sustained by her womb, and not by the wings %0a> that are on the outside of the body. Moreover, the outsiders have no part in %0a> the Holy Tree (ZA), especially not in its body. They refer only to the wings %0a> of Malchut, and no further. The outsider's place is under the wings of the %0a> Shechina, and no further. The righteous among the outsiders also refer to %0a> the outer side, and not to the inner. It is hence written: LET THE EARTH %0a> BRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL (Ne/esH Haya) AFTER ITS KIND. All %0a> receive Ne/esH from that Haya, but each according to its kind. %0a> %0a> ZA is referred to as the "Tree of Life" and his Nulcva is called the "Land of %0a> Life." For in the state of Gadlut, they both ascend and clothe AVI, who have Ohr %0a> Haya (the Light of Life). Therefore, it is said that the soul of Israel stems from %0a> the body of that tree, meaning from ZA himself. %0a> %0a> And the souls from that tree fly off to the Land of Life: as a result of a Zivug %0a> between the tree (ZA) and the land (Malchut), ZA gives the souls of Israel into %0a> Nukva, and Israel receives these souls from her, as opposed to the outsiders, who %0a> receive their souls from the wings of Malchut, but not from Malchut herself, not %0a> from what ZA passed to Malchut. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that Nukva has three Partzufim, which clothe one %0a> another. They are called Ibur (embryo), Yenika (nursing), and Mochin (adulthood, %0a> Gadlut). The big (Mochin) Partzuf is the innermost of the three, and is clothed by %0a> Partzuf Yenika, which is in turn clothed by Ibur. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Eighth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 425 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Israel receives from the innermost Partzuf (Gadlut of Nukva); hence, it is %0a> called the "darling son," for it stems from the inner part of Malchut, and not %0a> from her outer part (wings). %0a> %0a> NHY de Malchut are called "womb," for it is the place where the souls of %0a> Israel are conceived and grown. However, this does not refer to the NHY of %0a> the two outer Partzufim, called Vour and Yenika, as they are the wings of the %0a> Shechina-Malchut. Here The Zohar refers to the NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, the %0a> innermost Partzuf (the womb of Malchut). %0a> %0a> This is what the words of the prophet refer to: "Is Ephraim a darling son %0a> unto Me? Is he a child that is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I do %0a> earnestly remember him still; therefore, My heart yearns for him, I will surely %0a> have compassion upon him" (Yirmiyahu, 31:19). Because the souls of Israel stem %0a> from the inner part of Malchut, The Zohar says that they appeared from Malchut's %0a> womb, from NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, and not from NHY of the two outer %0a> Partzufim, called "wings." %0a> %0a> The outsiders (desires for correction) have no part in the Supernal Tree, %0a> especially not in its body. Their place is under the wings of the Shechina, and no %0a> further. The outsiders that come (to correct themselves) are called righteous, for %0a> the Shechina is also called the "righteous one." They come under her wings and %0a> unite within her. Yet, they have no place above the Shechina, and receive from %0a> Ne/esh Haya, from a Zivug of Malchut with ZA in Gadlut. But they only receive the %0a> portion of the Light called "wings"; hence, they are said to be under the wings %0a> of the Shechina, where each receives according to his properties. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Ninth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 233. The ninth Mitzva is to show mercy to the needy and supply them with %0a> food, as it is written: LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR %0a> LIKENESS, and this man will consist of two parts, male and female. IN OUR %0a> IMAGE refers to the rich; AFTER OUR LIKENESS refers to the poor. %0a> %0a> 234. For from the male side, they are rich, but from the female side, they are %0a> poor. And as they are united together, merciful to each other, and help each %0a> other, so below should the rich and the poor be united as one, and should %0a> share with each other, and show mercy to one another. %0a> %0a> 235. We see this in the book of King Shlomo (Solomon): he who shows %0a> mercy to the poor with all his heart, his image never differs from that of %0a> Adam, the first man. And since he was created in the image of Adam, he %0a> therefore governs all the creatures on earth by his image, as it is written: %0a> "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the %0a> earth" (Beresheet, 9:2), all fear that image, existing in him. For this Mitzva, %0a> to show mercy to the poor, is the most important of all the M.itzvot for %0a> elevating man to the image of Adam. %0a> %0a> 236. How do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar. Even though he dreamt %0a> a dream, as long as he had mercy upon the poor, that dream did not come %0a> true. However, as soon as he started looking badly upon the poor, his image %0a> changed at once, and he distanced from people. Hence, it is written, LET US %0a> MAKE MAN. It is said in the form as it was said of charity in another verse. %0a> Therefore, MAKE— is the same as charity. %0a> %0a> The rich and the poor correspond to the male and the female principles, to %0a> ZA and his Nukva. However, there is nothing here that hints at the obligation of %0a> the rich to be merciful to the poor and provide for his needs. But this instruction %0a> differs from the rest in that in all the others, the Creator's command is separated %0a> %0a> 427 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 428 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> from the action that follows it, as it is written, AND THE CREATOR SAID: %0a> 'LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT;' and also, AND THE %0a> CREATOR SAID: 'LET THE WATERS BE GATHERED...' AND IT WAS SO; %0a> and so on in all the Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> And none of the other Mitzvot contain the Creator's instruction mixed with %0a> action. This is so because the entire creation originated from AVI, where Aba %0a> spoke and Ima acted— Aba gave the Light to Ima, and after he gave it to her, he %0a> started acting on it himself. For only with the property of Aba could creation %0a> not have manifested in action, as there are no boundaries in creation, in which %0a> actions could be revealed. %0a> %0a> Hence, Aba issues a command that designates the passage of Light from %0a> him to Ima. However, since this is merely a command, and not an action (like a %0a> force instead of an action), the future tense is used. The same language is used %0a> in the description of man's creation: AND THE CREATOR SAID, "LET US %0a> CREATE MAN." Note that the plural form is used: LET US CREATE. %0a> %0a> Before the creation of the world of Atzilut (called the world of correction), %0a> an action known as Shevirat HaKelim (the breaking of the vessels in the world %0a> of Nekudim) took place in the spiritual worlds. It is written: "The Creator %0a> kept creating and destroying worlds, until He created this world (Atzilut), and %0a> He told it to stop spreading below the boundaries in which it was created" %0a> (Beresheet Raba, 3:7). %0a> %0a> The breaking of the vessels was essential, for it was the only opportunity to %0a> mix the egoistic properties (desires) with the altruistic ones; after all, distance %0a> in the spiritual is determined by the disparity of properties (desires). And that %0a> is why egoism and altruism are infinitely remote from each other. Yet, if this %0a> is so, how can egoism possibly be corrected? How can such properties or even %0a> notions of the existence of altruistic desires be introduced to man? %0a> %0a> So then, to allow egoistic desires to be corrected, the Creator performed the %0a> breaking of the vessels— the striking impact between opposite desires, egoistic %0a> and altruistic. It is called "striking," for it is impossible to unite these desires by %0a> any means other than an "explosion." %0a> %0a> As a result of this explosion, the altruistic, pure Kelim (desires) penetrated %0a> the egoistic, impure ones, and gave man an opportunity for free will and self- %0a> correction. After the destruction of the pure Kli and the descent of its parts into %0a> impurity, the world of Atzilut was formed. %0a> %0a> Out of all the mixed desires, the world of Atzilut selected only altruistic %0a> ones, attached them to itself, corrected them and filled them with Light. Out %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Ninth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 429 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> of these corrected parts, it made the worlds BYA with everything that exists %0a> within them. %0a> %0a> These corrections of the broken and mixed Kelim by the world of Atzilut %0a> are depicted in the first chapter of the Torah, which speaks of creation. It uses %0a> the instructions of exposing and separating the egoistic Kelim from the altruistic %0a> ones, as, for instance, in the following verses: AND THE CREATOR DIVIDED %0a> LIGHT FROM DARKNESS; THE CREATOR DIVIDED WATERS FROM %0a> DRY LAND; THE CREATOR DIVIDED DAY FROM NIGHT, and so forth. %0a> All these examples speak of the separation of the pure forces from the impure %0a> ones, of good from evil. And all that diverged became part of the pure system. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the entire act of creation is contained in the depiction of the first %0a> day of creation, in the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, as this is when Light was %0a> separated from darkness. This is because, on the whole, purity is called "Light" %0a> and impurity is called "darkness." And all the other definitions of purity and %0a> impurity are only particular names designating their various manifestations. %0a> %0a> The world of Atzilut made only a partial correction: it only separated %0a> altruistic desires from egoistic desires, Light from darkness, and thus created %0a> the system of creation, described in the beginning of the Torah. However, this %0a> does not complete the correction, as darkness and impurity are simply detached %0a> from participating in creation, but remain utterly uncorrected. They are simply %0a> separated as an entirely unnecessary part, and this completely defies the perfection %0a> of the Creator, who created everything (including darkness) for His final goal. %0a> Moreover, correction ends specifically with the correction of darkness, as it is %0a> said: "Night shines as day; darkness as Light." (Tehilim, 139:12). %0a> %0a> To correct this, man was created containing everything, and consisting of %0a> all the properties of creation: from the absolute goodness to total evil. This %0a> enables man to execute the correction and achieve complete perfection. In other %0a> words, he must turn evil to good, bitter to sweet, and darkness to Light. As a %0a> result, death will disappear forever, and the Creator will manifest as the King of %0a> all creation. %0a> %0a> Hence, there is a great difference between the description of man's creation %0a> and that of all the other creatures and parts of creation. Here, the action itself %0a> was mixed with the instructions, for the instructions, descriptions come from %0a> Ima, not from Aba, who said, LET US CREATE MAN— together with Malchut %0a> of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that Malchut includes everything, for she also gives the %0a> Light of sustenance to the impure forces to keep them from disappearing from %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 430 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the world, as, like all the other elements of creation, the impure forces cannot %0a> exist without Light, and immediately disappear. It is written in this regard: HER %0a> FEET DESCEND TO DEATH, for the impure forces receive a tiny spark of %0a> Light to sustain their existence. %0a> %0a> This is why Malchut is called Assiya (action), for she spreads and rules in the %0a> whole of creation. She is also called "darkness," for she shines with a spark of %0a> Light, to sustain the darkness and evil. %0a> %0a> Hence, when Ima unites with Malchut and their properties mix, she receives %0a> the properties of darkness, of which it is said: LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR %0a> IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, for Light is called "image," and darkness is %0a> called "likeness." Indeed, after Ima mixes with Malchut, these two forces, IMAGE %0a> and LIKENESS, appear in her as well. As a result, man, who was created by her, %0a> contains these two forces— IMAGE and LIKENESS, too. %0a> %0a> From the phrase, LET US MAKE, it follows that Ima consists of two parts, %0a> male and female. Although Ima is a male part (giving is a male property), she is %0a> connected to Malchut. Besides, the male property suggests the presence of Light, %0a> while the property of Nukva (the female part) is poverty and darkness. %0a> %0a> And since Ima accepted Malchut as her partner with the purpose of creating %0a> man (accepted the properties of Malchut), she is now filled with poverty and %0a> darkness. It follows that man consists of the properties of Ima (wealth and Light), %0a> as well as of the properties of Malchut (poverty and darkness). %0a> %0a> And it is this precise combination of the properties of Ima and Malchut that %0a> enables man to correct Malchut, fill her with Light, and spread spiritual purity %0a> and holiness throughout the entire earth (Malchut). It is written that at the %0a> end of correction, "the Creator and His Name shall be one," for the darkness %0a> in Malchut will be transformed into Light, as in the male part, HaVaYaH. %0a> Everything will be as one in the male property, as it is said, "There will be no %0a> poor in your nation." %0a> %0a> This Mitzva says that as Ima united with Malchut so as to correct her, which %0a> is why Ima includes Image and Likeness, man needs to correct his qualities in %0a> order to correct the parts of darkness within him. To this end, he must diminish %0a> his properties, just like Ima, and give his part (charity) to the poor Malchut, who %0a> is deprived of Light. He must show mercy to the LIKENESS (poverty) within %0a> him, and provide it with everything it needs. %0a> %0a> By observing this Mitzva, man receives IMAGE and LIKENESS from Ima, %0a> the Upper Light that was received by Adam, created in IMAGE and LIKENESS. %0a> This is why he has the power to rule over all the animals in the world (all of his %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Ninth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 431 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> animal desires) to such an extent that no impure force (desire) remains within %0a> him, which he cannot defeat and correct. %0a> %0a> The Zohar gives the example of Navuchadnetzar (Nebuchadnezzar): although %0a> the Supreme verdict with regard to him was reached, his dream did not come %0a> true as long as he was merciful to the poor. However, as soon as he allowed his %0a> evil eye to look badly upon the poor, the sentence was immediately executed, %0a> and his image changed (those who are interested can turn to The Book of Daniel). %0a> Thus we see that this Mitzva is greater than all the others, and that it can overrule %0a> the Supreme verdict made against man. %0a> %0a> "Charity" signifies the union of Bina and Malchut. Similarly, the story %0a> about the marriage of Rut (Ruth) the Moavite, King David's grandmother %0a> (Malchut), and Boaz, who was merciful to her (this marriage started Israel's %0a> Royal Dynasty), describes the correction of Malchut by Bina (See Megilat Rut— %0a> The Book of Ruth). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 237. The tenth Mitzva obliges man to put on Tefillin and to attain the Supernal %0a> properties, as it is written, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN %0a> IMAGE. He opened and said, "Your head upon you is like the Carmel." This %0a> text refers to the Supernal head— the Tefillin worn on the head of the Holy, %0a> Supernal King HdVaYaH, written in separate letters. Each letter in the holy %0a> name HdVaYaH corresponds to a certain paragraph in the Tefillin. Thus, the %0a> Holy, Supernal Name is written in the scrolls of Tefillin, in the secrets of the %0a> letters. For THE NAME OF THE CREATOR IS UPON YOU, AND THEY %0a> SHALL BE AFRAID OF YOU refers to the head Tefillin, which contains the %0a> Holy Name HaVaYaH. %0a> %0a> By being merciful to the poor, one merely begins to receive the Creator's %0a> Supernal image. Bina absorbs the properties of Malchut, described by the verse, %0a> LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS. By %0a> unifying Bina's properties with those of Malchut, AHP de Bina (the letters ELEH) %0a> fell to ZON, and only the letters MI (GE) remained in Ima. AHP de Bina that %0a> fell to ZON consist of Aba and Ima: Aba assumes the properties of ZA, and Ima %0a> assumes the properties of Nukva. %0a> %0a> Since AVI descended to the place of ZON, they became like ZON. And from %0a> them ZON receive the state of Katnut, called TZELEM Elokim, likeness to Bina %0a> (VAK), for Ima lost the GAR of her own state, that is, since her AHP fell to ZON, %0a> she lost the Light of GAR (see diagram on next page). %0a> %0a> Therefore, only the letters MI = GE = K-H remained in Ima, whereas her %0a> B-ZA-M = AHP = ELEH fell to ZON. Thus, of the five Lights NRNHY that were %0a> inside Ima, she retained only Ohr Ruach in Keter and Ohr Ne/esh in Hochma. %0a> Thus, Ima can only give ZON the Light of VAK = Ruach + Nefesh, but not the %0a> Light of GAR = NRNHY. Also, ZON are considered to have acquired likeness to %0a> %0a> 433 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 434 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the Upper One only upon receiving the Lights NRNHY. And this is achieved by %0a> the fulfillment of the Mitzva of Tefillin. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Light of %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yechida %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> Chaya %0a> Neshama %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> Ruach %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Nefesh %0a> %0a> %0a> %3c %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Yet, a question arises: we have already learned that to create the Partzuf of %0a> lower man out of ZON, ZON must ascend to AVI and receive the Light of GAR, %0a> for a small Partzuf without Ohr Hochma cannot beget. So why is it said that Ima %0a> is in a state of Katnutl %0a> %0a> When ZON attain reception of the Light of AVI, they thereby ascend to AVI %0a> and become similar to AVI in their properties, for each lower one that ascends %0a> to the Upper One becomes like it. Indeed, only the magnitude of the screen %0a> distinguishes between spiritual objects, as only the magnitude of the screen %0a> determines all of the object's properties. %0a> %0a> Thus, upon ascending and clothing AVI, ZON become like AVI, and all the %0a> properties of AVI are now naturally adopted by ZON. Just as AVI create ZON, %0a> ZON in AVI beget and pass the Light into the Partzuf of lower man. Hence, there %0a> is no need to even change names, for everything occurs at the degree of AVI. %0a> And upon ascending there, ZON are already called AVI, and the Light that they %0a> pass to man is regarded as the Light intended for ZON. %0a> %0a> It is written: THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. %0a> The Hebrew word "image" that is used in the Torah is T?eLeM, and is formed by %0a> three letters: Tzadi-Lamed-Mem. In item 2, we said that there are no Kelim for Ohr %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 435 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Haya and Yechida; rather, there are only Kelirn Bina-ZA-Malchut for the Lights %0a> NRN: 'Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama. %0a> %0a> So even when we say that there is a Kli called Keter, we imply that the %0a> count starts with Bina de Keter, not with Keter de Keter. Bina and ZON, the %0a> Kelim that remained in the Partzuf, are divided into three lines: the line of %0a> Bina—HBD, the line of ZA-HGT, and the line of Malchut— NHYM. This is %0a> characteristic of Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Bina - Hochma %0a> %0a> Daat Bina %0a> %0a> Gevura - Hesed %0a> %0a> Tifferet ZA %0a> %0a> Hod - Netzah %0a> %0a> Yesod %0a> %0a> Malchut Malchut %0a> %0a> However, when Ohr Hochma is transferred, Partzuf Bina divides into two %0a> Partzufim: AVI and YESHSUT. These constitute HBD = three and HGT = three. %0a> Along with ZAT = seven Sefirot, from Hesed to Malchut, and form the Gematria %0a> of thirteen (3 + 3 + 7) of the word Echad, which alludes to the complete name, %0a> state, and attainment. %0a> %0a> The thing is that Sefirot Keter and Hochma are concealed in AA, and only its %0a> Sefira Bina sends her Light down. This Sefira Bina de AA is divided into two Partzufim, %0a> AVI and YESHSUT: her GAR shines in AVI and her ZAT shines in YESHSUT %0a> These two parts of Bina are called M (Mem) and L (Lamed) of the word T^eLeM: %0a> %0a> 1. AVI are called M of the word TzeLeM, as they form a closed ring %0a> guarding Ohr Hochma, preventing it from reaching the other, lower %0a> Partzufim. This Ohr Hochma is referred to as "concealed" (from all the %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut), and only Ohr Hassadim, Ohr Ruach, %0a> descends from them to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut during %0a> the 6,000 years until the end of correction. %0a> %0a> 2. YESHSUT is called L of the word TzeLeM, as it bows its head (GAR) %0a> and resembles a tower. It is written about this tower: "The Tower of %0a> Oz (strength) of the Creator's name." This is because YESHSUT is %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 436 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> called a "tower," and ZA is known as the "righteous one." After all, %0a> YESHSUT is ZAT de Bina, the properties of ZON that are included in %0a> Bina; hence, it passes its Ohr Hochma to ZON. %0a> %0a> If ZON in Katnut are filled with Ohr Hassadim (Ruach called Avir— air), then %0a> during the reception of Ohr Hochma from YESHSUT, the letter Yod in the word %0a> Avir exits, and Avir turns into Ohr (Light). Hence, YESHSUT is called a "tower," %0a> i.e., a Partzuf in Gadlut that contains Hochma, soaring in the air (Avir). %0a> %0a> However, this state in ZON is inconstant. YESHSUT intermittently returns %0a> to Katnut and to Gadlut; therefore, such a state is called "soaring." ZA is called %0a> Tz (Tzadi) of the word T^eLeM, for such is his property inside this tower. Thus: %0a> %0a> - AVI— M (Mem)— Hochma that is concealed inside a ring. %0a> %0a> - YESHSUT— L (Lamed)— Bina, though as she ascends to AA, she becomes %0a> Hochma (tower) and passes Ohr Hochma down. %0a> %0a> - ZON— Tz (Tzadi)— Daat, receives the Light from YESHSUT. %0a> %0a> However, one should not confuse the three letters Tz-L-M with the three %0a> lines called HBD: T^eLeM consists of three Partzufim, one inside the other. %0a> Partzuf Hochma (M of the TzeLeM, AVI) is the innermost Partzuf; Partzuf Bina %0a> (YESHSUT, L of the TzeLeM) clothes it from Chazeh de AVI downward; and %0a> from Chazeh de YESHSUT downwards, Partzuf Bina is clothed by Partzuf Daat, %0a> ZA, Tz of the word TzeLeM. %0a> %0a> The words, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE %0a> (TzeLeM), mean that with the help of the spiritual observance of the Mitzva of %0a> Tefillin, Ohr Hochma is received in accordance with the ascending order of the %0a> letters Tz-L-M. This is the Light that Adam received after his creation, whereas we %0a> first stimulate the reception of this Light in ZON, and from ZON we stimulate %0a> its reception into ourselves. %0a> %0a> THE HEAD TEFILLIN CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE HOLY KING, %0a> INSCRIBED IN THE LETTERS HaVaYaH-the head Tefillin is the name of %0a> the Supernal King, inscribed in the letters HaVaYaH. The Tefillin are called the %0a> Carmel (Car Maleh-all goodness), as it is written: YOUR HEAD UPON YOU %0a> IS LIKE THE CARMEL. This is because when the heads of ZA and Malchut put %0a> on the head Tefillin (the Upper Light of TzeLeM), they become like the Carmel %0a> (Car Maleh— all goodness). %0a> %0a> This Light is called "The name of the Supernal, Holy King," the four %0a> letters of HaVaYaH, where each letter is written separately: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey . %0a> And the reason why man feels that the letters are written separately is that each %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 437 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Partzuf contains the four letters of HaVaYaH, and each of them designates an %0a> independent Partzuf. %0a> %0a> Every letter constitutes a separate passage on the parchment (in the %0a> Tefillin); four separate passages correspond to the four letters of HaVaYaH. A %0a> passage (Hebrew— Parashah) represents a separate and complete Partzuf, and its %0a> corresponding letter in HaVaYaH symbolizes the Light in this Partzuf. The order %0a> of Partzufim corresponds to the order of the letters of HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a> Hey. Such a Tefillin is called the Tefillin of Rashi. %0a> %0a> However, there is a Tefillin with the order of passages (Partzufim) Yod-Hey- %0a> Hey-Vav, called Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn. The passages that are written on fragments %0a> of parchment are identical, but the order of putting them into the boxes of %0a> Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn is different: Yod-Hey-Hey-Vav. %0a> %0a> 238. The first passage in the Tefillin corresponds to the letter Yod of the %0a> name HaVaYaH (Hochma) and refers to the Mitzva, "Sanctify to Me all the %0a> firstborn." This is because Hochma is the firstborn of all the Supernal Ones. %0a> It opens the place of conception for the future firstborn with the help of %0a> a thin line of Light that emanates from Yod, which opens the womb and %0a> impregnates it. %0a> %0a> AVI are designated by the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH, where Yod %0a> signifies Aba and the filling of Yod (according to its pronunciation: Yod = Yod + %0a> Vav + Dalet), i.e., Vav + Dalet constitutes lma. Partzuf AVI is called "holy" and %0a> "first born," for Partzufim YESHSUT and ZON are called holy only when they %0a> receive holiness (Ohr Hochma) from AVI. All the holiness in the world of Atzilut %0a> comes from AVI. %0a> %0a> This is so because Ohr Hochma is called "holiness" and AVI is Mem of the %0a> word T^eLeM (Hochma de Atzilut), for the Supernal Hochma of the world of Atzilut %0a> is concealed within them. AVI themselves are defined as Bina in the property %0a> of Hassadim, as Hochma is concealed within Rosh de AA, and the lower ones can %0a> receive it only if Bina ascends to Hochma, to Rosh de AA, where Bina unites with %0a> Hochma of Rosh de AA and assumes the name Hochma. However, she is not the %0a> ordinary Hochma; she is called "Hochma of the thirty-two paths" of descending %0a> Ohr Hochma, and only this Hochma bestows Ohr Hochma upon all the Partzufim %0a> of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> This is why The Zohar says that this thin ray of Light, called the "path of %0a> Light," opens the womb and conceives the future offspring. Yod consists of three %0a> parts: (i) the upper "spike" of the letter Yod, a small line above the point, which %0a> is called Rosh and designates Partzuf AA that is concealed in AVI; (ii) the body of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 438 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the Yod, which forms PartzufAVl; and (iii) the lower "spike" of the letter, which %0a> designates Yesod, the end of Partzuf AVI. %0a> %0a> Through the continuous Zivug between Yesod de Aba and Yesod de Ima, the %0a> great waters descend onto all the lower worlds with all that inhabits them. This %0a> Zivug on Ohr Hassadim is called a "Zivug that revives the worlds." Yesod de Ima %0a> is also called Rechem (womb), for all Rachamim (mercy) stems from this part of %0a> Its Partzuf. Yet, if AVI do not make a Zivug, this part of Ima is closed, and mercy %0a> does not descend below. Only Yesod de Aba can open Yesod de Ima, whereupon %0a> Ima passes her great waters to the lower ones. %0a> %0a> 239. The second passage in the Tefillin, WHEN YOU COME, corresponds %0a> to the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH, the hall (Bind) that opens up %0a> under the influence of the letter Yod (Aba) in fifty entrances, passages, and %0a> chambers concealed within it. The revelation that Yod made in that hall was %0a> done so as to hear the voice of the Shofar (a ram's horn), Bind. The Shofar %0a> is closed on all sides, but the letter Yod came and opened it so that its sound %0a> could be heard. And since it opened the Shofar and derived sound from it, %0a> Yod led all to freedom. %0a> %0a> The letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH is YESHSUT, L in the word TzeLeM. It %0a> is called a "tower soaring in the air," a hall with fifty entrances, for the concealed %0a> AVI are designated by the M of TzeLeM, by the ring that surrounds Ohr Hochma %0a> and prevents it from shining outside. And they shine only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> However, by rising to Rosh de AA, where Bina turns into Hochma, YESHSUT %0a> can pass Ohr Hochma to ZON. Bina, who turns into Hochma in order to receive %0a> Hochma for ZON, is called the "fifty gates of Bina," for she consists of five Sefirot %0a> KHB-ZA-M, ten in each. Each of these fifty Sefirot consists of a chamber and %0a> an entrance: HGT are called a "chamber" and NHY are called an "entrance," %0a> a "passage," implying the absence of a Kli for reception. Instead, it serves for %0a> transferring the Light into, or out of the chamber. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the second passage used in the Tefillin: AND WHEN YOU %0a> COME designates the letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH, YESHSUT of the world %0a> of Atzilut, which ascends to accept Ohr Hochma and pass it on to ZON below. %0a> %0a> Yod opened this hall so as to hear the voice that comes from the ram's horn, %0a> for this horn is closed on all sides. As was already mentioned, YESHSUT (Bina) %0a> united with Malchut by lowering her three Sefirot ELEH (Bina and ZON) to %0a> ZON, while YESHSUT remained with only two Sefirot KH, MI. %0a> %0a> Then, as a result of raising MAN, Malchut descends from the Eynaim (eyes), the %0a> Eynaim of YESHSUT open up, Malchut descends to her own place in the Peh, and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 439 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the three letters ELEH reunite with MI to form the name ELOKIM. GE = KH de %0a> ZON ascend to Bina along with these ELEH. However, although ELEH ascended %0a> and joined MI, the name ELOKIM is still considered closed, for it has only Ohr %0a> Hochma, and Ohr Hochma cannot shine in ELEH without Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> These three letters ELEH are therefore defined as a horn (Shofar), and ZON %0a> that ascended to Bina along with ELEH are concealed within them. And these %0a> ZON in ELEH are referred to as a "voice." This voice sounds in the hall with the %0a> help of the letter Yod, for Yod designates AVI that bestow the Light from Above, %0a> which facilitates the lowering of Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de YESHSUT to %0a> her place in the Peh, and raising ELEH back to Bina. Hence, Yod opens up the %0a> hall of Light in YESHSUT in order to pass this Light to ZON from the Shofar %0a> (the ascended letters ELEH). %0a> %0a> ZON, too, ascend to Bina along with ELEH and there receive Hochma. This %0a> great Light in ZA is called a "voice," and its reception is known as "listening to %0a> the voice." However, this horn is closed on all sides, on the sides of Hochma and %0a> Hassadim, for the letters ELEH (called a "horn") fall to ZON, where they remain %0a> closed and inaccessible both to Ohr Hochma and to Ohr Hassadim. %0a> %0a> Consequently, two corrections are needed: (i) to elevate and unite them %0a> with Bina, enabling them to once more attain their Ohr Hochma; (ii) to provide %0a> them with Ohr Hassadim so it can serve as a garment for Ohr Hochma. %0a> %0a> First, Yod (AVI) pass the Light to Hey (YESHSUT), whereupon ELEH rise %0a> above Malchut, to Bina, together with ZON, and there receive Ohr Hochma. %0a> However, this Ohr Hochma is called concealed or closed, for it cannot shine %0a> without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. This means that the voice has not yet %0a> emerged— ZA has not yet been born. %0a> %0a> After that, Yod enters into the word Light = Ohr; hence, it turns into Avir %0a> = air (Ohr Hassadim). And since the horn (the letters ELEH) received air (Ohr %0a> Hassadim), they can beget ZA (the voice of the Shofar), for being clothed in Ohr %0a> Hassadim, Ohr Hochma can enter ZA. %0a> %0a> The general Light that ZA receives is called "voice." And this voice frees %0a> all the slaves that were enslaved by the egoistic desires in all the worlds, for ZA %0a> shines down on all the lower ones. Thus, the sons of Israel (man's spiritual %0a> aspirations) merit the Light of deliverance (defeat the earthly, egoistic ones). %0a> %0a> 240. At the sounds of the Shofar, the sons of Israel were delivered from Egypt. %0a> And so shall the Shofar be blown in the future, the next time at the end of %0a> days. And all deliverance originates from this Shofar, which is Bina. This is %0a> why the deliverance from Egypt is mentioned in this chapter of the Torah, for %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 440 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> this Shofar stems from the force of the letter Yod, which opens the womb and %0a> delivers the captives to freedom. And this is the letter Hey, the second letter %0a> of the name HaVaYaH. %0a> %0a> All of the Light in ZON comes from the horn (ELEH), including the great %0a> Light that delivers Israel from Egypt, and the Light that is destined to be revealed %0a> in the future, at the end of days (complete deliverance from egoism). This is why %0a> the Tefillin contain a passage that refers to the exodus from Egypt, for the Light %0a> delivering from Egypt comes from the horn, which is inside YESHSUT. This is %0a> done by the power of AVI, called Yod de HaVaYaH, which open the womb of %0a> YESHSUT (ELEH) and free the voice (ZA) from its captivity. %0a> %0a> This Light has sufficient power to deliver Israel from slavery. Only after the %0a> attainment of this Light (Ohr Haya), and not a degree lower, can ZA and Nukva %0a> be called "voice" and "speech." All deliverance comes only from Ohr Haya (only %0a> upon ascending the spiritual degree of Ohr Haya can man liberate himself from %0a> egoism and become free). %0a> %0a> 241. The third passage in the Tefillin is the secret of the Unity in "Hear O %0a> Israel," the letter Vav in HaVaYaH, which includes all and designates ZA, %0a> who contains the unity of all. Everything merges in unity within him, and %0a> he receives all. The fourth passage that reads, "You shall hear," includes two %0a> sides, Hesed and Qevura, which unite with the Assembly of Israel, called %0a> the lower Qevura or Malchut. And this is the last letter Hey of the name %0a> HaVaYaH, which takes and includes them all. %0a> %0a> The third passage in the Tefillin (Hear O Israel) is Partzuf ZA, the letter Vav %0a> in HaVaYaH, which includes all four passages contained in the Tefillin. Although %0a> the first two passages (AVI and YESHSUT) represent Hochma and Bina, they do %0a> not really constitute Hochma and Bina themselves, but rather, their part, which %0a> clothes in Rosh de ZON, called M and L of TZeLeM de ZA. %0a> %0a> Similarly, the fourth passage, Malchut of ZA, does not imply that this is %0a> Malchut herself. Rather, it refers to her part that is included in ZA and is called %0a> Mochin (brain) de Gevura. There are three parts of Mochin in ZA: Hochma, Bina, %0a> and Daat, which are accordingly called M, L and Tz of T^eLeM de ZA. They are %0a> the same HB-ZA-M as in Mochin de ZA. This is because Daat (Tz) includes Hesed %0a> and Gevura. And this Hesed in Daat is defined as ZA himself, and Gevura is %0a> defined as the inclusion (of the properties) of Nukva in ZA. And these H-B-ZA-M %0a> constitute the four passages contained in the Tefillin. %0a> %0a> This is why ZA, the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH, includes all four %0a> passages. And all the unions that come from AVI and YESHSUT are done within %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 441 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> him, i.e., for his sake. For all the Higher Partzufim that precede ZA are united %0a> (with the Creator), and need no MAN from the lower ones to reach the state of %0a> unity. Whereas all the MAN raised by the lower ones to the Upper Partzufim are %0a> meant solely for the unification of ZA, and in no way affect the constant unity %0a> of the Higher Partzufim with the Creator. %0a> %0a> The unification of Hochma with Bina, as a result of which Bina becomes %0a> like Hochma, occurs only on account of ZA being raised to Bina in the form of %0a> MAN. For when ZA is raised to Bina as MAN, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA and %0a> there receives Hochma for ZA. Since Bina aspires only to mercy (Ohr Hassadim), %0a> she never receives Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake, but only if the lower ones %0a> are in need of it. Her role, her properties are only to bestow, and not to receive. %0a> (Note that in the spiritual, "reception" is always for the Creator's sake.) %0a> %0a> Hence, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA only for the sake of ZON. And it is ZA %0a> alone that ascends to Bina and stimulates her to ascend to Rosh de AA, where she %0a> makes a Zivug with Hochma and passes this Light to him. It is therefore said that %0a> ZA receives all, as Bina passes everything that she receives in Rosh de AA to him. %0a> And Ohr Hochma is revealed only in the place of ZA (not Bina), as he descends %0a> back to his place below Chazeh de ZA. %0a> %0a> The prayer "Hear O Israel" designates ZA, the letter Vav of the name %0a> HaVaYaH, the Supernal unity (item 207) that reveals love only from the good %0a> side. And since it refers only to "Love your Creator...," it contains no restrictions %0a> or strictness of judgment. %0a> %0a> However, in the fourth passage, "You shall hear," the last Hey of the name %0a> HaVaYaH, Nukva de ZA that is included in him, Gevura in Rosh de ZA, reveals %0a> both sides of love— good, as well as evil (item 206), reflected in the words of this %0a> passage. It ends with the words: "Blessed be His great name for ever and ever," %0a> which corresponds to the inclusion and unity of Nukva in ZA, meaning not %0a> Nukt/a herself, but her part in ZA, i.e., Mochin de Daat. %0a> %0a> Gevura in Daat is the second Hey in HaVaYaH. It accepts all the Light of %0a> the Supernal unity contained in "Hear O Israel," and includes all. And since it %0a> contains all the perfection of unity, it reveals all the Light and both sides of love, %0a> for the property of judgment that complements love to perfection exists only %0a> within it, and not Above. %0a> %0a> It is therefore written: "Your head upon you is like the Carmel, " des ignating %0a> the head Tefillin. Indeed, after ZA is clothed in all four Lights, designated by %0a> the four paragraphs of the Tefillin, which are the three letters Tz, L, and M of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 442 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the word T^eLeM, his head is defined as the Carmel (Car Maleh— completely %0a> filled with goodness). %0a> %0a> 242. Tefillin are the letters of the holy name. Therefore, "Your head upon %0a> you is like the Carmel" refers to the head Tefillin. The letter Dcdet refers to %0a> the hand Tefillin, Malchut, who is depleted of Light, compared to the head %0a> Tefillin, ZA, but she contains the perfection of the Upper One. %0a> %0a> The hand Tefillin designates Malchut. And she is poor in comparison with %0a> Bina, the Upper World. Yet, she has her own perfection, for she now receives it %0a> from Bina thanks to the unity between Nukva and ZA in "Blessed be His great %0a> name for ever and ever." %0a> %0a> And since she is not the Nukva that is included in ZA (his body), but a %0a> separate Nukva of ZA, she takes all four passages from him, H-B-ZA-M of ZA, for %0a> she has a separate, complete Partzuf. However, these four passages of the Torah %0a> are in the same place; they are not separated from each other by partitions, as %0a> in the Tefillin of ZA. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is that a passage of the Torah is the Light, and the place %0a> where it dwells is a Kli (the Tefillin in our world is a box made of a "pure" animal's %0a> skin, into which four parchment scrolls are placed, and the corresponding %0a> passages from the Torah are written on each). As we know, every Zivug emanates %0a> Light. Since ZA receives four Lights H-B-H-G in four Kelim, as a result of four %0a> Zivugim, he contains four compartments for four passages, each compartment %0a> containing a particular passage from the Torah. %0a> %0a> However, no Zivug is made on Malchut herself. Everything that Malchut has, %0a> she receives from ZA. Malchut receives all four Lights (four passages from the %0a> Torah that result from one Zivug with ZA); hence, she has only one place for all %0a> four passages (Lights). %0a> %0a> 243. "The King is held captive in the tubs" means that he is tied down and held %0a> in those four compartments of the Tefillin for the purpose of being properly %0a> united with that holy name. And he who makes this correction, exists in image %0a> and likeness, TZELEM, with the Creator. Just as the holy name is united in %0a> the Creator, the holy name is united in him. "Male and female he created %0a> them" refers to the head and the hand Tefillin. And it is one. %0a> %0a> "The King is held captive in the tubs" signifies ZA, who is bound and %0a> unified in those compartments of the Tefillin. The compartments of the Tefillin, %0a> which contain the passages from the Torah, are called "tubs" or "troughs," just %0a> like the tubs from which sheep drink water, for the waters of Ohr Hochma and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Tenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 443 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Ohr Hassadim are bound and restricted by these Kelim, the compartments of the %0a> Tefillin. And it is the Creator who is bound tight and held in these Kelim, so as %0a> to be unified in the holy name. %0a> %0a> The compartments of the Tefillin are the TNHY of Tvuna, the lower part of %0a> YESHSUT (Israel-Saba and Tvuna, where Israel-Saba is the male part and Tvuna %0a> is the female). This part of Tvuna is called the big letter Dalet of the word Echad %0a> (one) in the verse, "Hear O Israel, our Creator is one." It is written about this %0a> letter: "Let the dry land appear." %0a> %0a> As was already mentioned in the third Mitzva, because this "dry land" was %0a> revealed in ZA, he can pass the Light to Malchut. Thus, were it not for these four %0a> places in ZA, the dry land within him, he would have been unable to give the %0a> Light to Nukva. Hence, it is said that ZA "is tied down and held in those places" %0a> that stem from dry land so as to enable him to unite and pass the revelation of %0a> the Creator's Light into the holy name, Nukva. As a result, the dry land becomes %0a> fertile and produces fruit. %0a> %0a> Therefore, he who has completed the corrections of these four passages %0a> from the Torah acquires the image and likeness (T^eLeM) of the Creator. In %0a> other words, when man "below" (below the world of Atzilut, in the worlds BYA) %0a> "puts on" the Tefillin (attains the level of this degree), he receives the Light of H- %0a> B-H-G from ZA. This Light is called TzeLeM, since Hochma and Bina are called M %0a> and L, whereas Hesed and Gevura are called Tz. And just like Elokim, Bina unites %0a> with the holy name of Malchut, thereby uniting the holy name within man, for %0a> man is a part of Malchut. %0a> %0a> There are two parts— male and female— in the Light of Hochma and Bina %0a> (called TzeLeM): TzeLeM of ZA and TzeLeM of Nukva, the head Tefillin and the %0a> hand Tefillin. Hence, it is said that the Creator created a man and a woman, %0a> referring to the head Tefillin and the hand Tefillin. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Eleventh Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 244. The eleventh Mitzva is to give a tithe of the fruits of the earth. Here %0a> there are two M.itzvoU to separate a tithe of the fruits of the earth, and to %0a> bring the first fruits of the trees, as it is written, "Behold, I have given you %0a> every herb-yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth" (Beresheet, %0a> 1:29). Here it is written, I HAVE GIVEN YOU. Elsewhere it is written, "And %0a> to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel" (Bamidbar, %0a> 18:21). It is also written, "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of %0a> the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Creator's" (Vayikra, 27:30). %0a> %0a> These verses say that the Creator gave everything to Adam. Yet, why does %0a> that oblige us to separate a tithe, to bring the first fruits of the earth, and why are %0a> we forbidden from eating them? After all, this contradicts the aforesaid. %0a> %0a> The thing is that the process of (spiritual) nourishment includes exposure, %0a> selection, and separation of the holy sparks of the Light from the impure forces. %0a> In the process of feeding (reception of Light), the sparks of the Light (Nitzotzin) %0a> that are contained in the food unite with man's soul, with his very flesh, and the %0a> waste, except for the sparks, leaves the body. This continues throughout man's %0a> life (6,000 degrees of ascent); he gradually accumulates within him all the holy %0a> sparks, with which he complements his soul. Without them, the soul cannot %0a> attain completeness and perfection. %0a> %0a> I think that the reader already understands that The Zohar in no way speaks %0a> about the process of feeding, digestion, and secretion of our physical body. As %0a> the whole of the Torah, The Zohar speaks only of the goal of creation and the %0a> ways of its attainment. Therefore, I call upon the reader (in defiance of what his %0a> mind suggests to him after the first reading) to realize that these texts are written %0a> in the language of branches, when spiritual objects are described in the language %0a> of our world; yet, despite the corporeal language, the objects remain spiritual! %0a> %0a> 445 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 446 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It is written in the weekly portion Lech Lecha that Adam was forbidden to %0a> eat meat: "I have given you every herb..." (Beresheet, 1:29). However, since Adam %0a> sinned, and egoism, impurity entered his body, it was said to Noah: "Every %0a> moving thing that lives shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given %0a> you all" (Beresheet, 9:3), that is, including meat. %0a> %0a> Since Adam was created in absolute perfection, everything was sorted and %0a> corrected within him, which corresponds to the animate part of creation, as it %0a> is written (Beresheet, 2:19): "Out of the ground the Creator formed every beast %0a> of the field," and also, "whatsoever the man would call every living creature, %0a> that was to be the name thereof." This means that Adam attained every name %0a> (spiritual level) of the animal souls, for the pure forces were already separated %0a> from the impure ones. %0a> %0a> Hence, Adam was not given the task of exposing, sorting, and correcting %0a> animals by eating them, for even before the creation of man, the Creator %0a> corrected this in the world of Atzilut. And only the inanimate and vegetative %0a> (parts of the soul) remained uncorrected, containing both pure and impure %0a> forces. Therefore, Adam was instructed to expose the sparks that his soul lacked %0a> in the inanimate and vegetative food. %0a> %0a> However, as a result of Adam's sin, pure and impure desires (forces) were %0a> mixed once more. And as Adam's soul was shattered into many parts, all %0a> of which fell into the impure forces, all the animals (animate desires) were %0a> corrupted along with him (with the human level of desire). Thus appeared the %0a> need to expose, sort, and correct them. Therefore, after the sin the Creator %0a> ordered Adam and the subsequent generations to eat animals, and thus extract %0a> the sparks from impurity. %0a> %0a> It is said that Adam was created IN THE IMAGE AND AFTER LIKENESS, %0a> i.e., with the help of the T^eLeM Elokim, the Light of Bina, by the four passages %0a> from the Torah in the Tefillin. And this is his soul. However, after he was born %0a> with this holy soul, thanks to his good deeds, he merited raising MAN and %0a> receiving Ohr Haya, and then, on Shabbat, attaining Ohr Yechida as well. %0a> %0a> Therefore, Adam was left to correct the creation with the help of only a tithe %0a> and offerings. And by feeding on tithe and offerings, he attained the revelation %0a> of his desires and raised MAN to the level of Ohr Haya and Yechida. Yet, after %0a> he sinned, all of his corrections and everything that had filled his soul was %0a> corrupted, mixed, and egoism took over the body. %0a> %0a> Due to our egoism, tithe and offerings are forbidden for us, for fear that we %0a> will desire Supernal purity. Instead, we are obliged to extract and pass them on %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Eleventh Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 447 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to the Cohanim and Levi'im (parts of the soul). And if we observe this Creator's %0a> Mitzva of spiritually separating a tithe of the fruits of the earth and the offerings %0a> (as He commanded), we will receive the strength to raise MAN and receive Ohr %0a> Haya on Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds is called Shabbat) in the same way that %0a> Adam attained this state while feeding on tithe and offerings. %0a> %0a> Thus, after man receives Ohr Neshama by putting on the Tefillin, he can raise %0a> MAN with the help of the two Mitzvot (tithe and offerings) in order to receive %0a> Ohr Haya. As it is explained, Adam was receiving Ohr Haya by feeding on tithe %0a> and offerings. However, we are forbidden to feed on them (to try to receive %0a> this Light for the Creator's sake) because of the egoism that acts in our body %0a> (desires). Instead, we are bid to give a tithe and the offerings to the Cohanim and %0a> the Levi'im. As a result, we receive the strength to receive this Light. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Twelfth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 245. The twelfth Mitzva is to bring the first fruits of the trees as an offering, %0a> as it is written, "And every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed" %0a> (Beresheet, 1:29). All that is worthy of Me shall not be eaten by you. I have %0a> given you My permission and I have given you all the tithe and offerings of the %0a> trees. "To you," and not to the subsequent generations. %0a> %0a> From the aforesaid, it becomes clear that we, the subsequent generations, are %0a> forbidden to feed on tithe and offerings. The Light called "tithe" and "offerings" %0a> is so great that until all the Kelim (desires) of Adam's soul have been corrected, it %0a> is impossible to receive it for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is forbidden to even try, lest we sin, as it happened to Adam. There %0a> is a Mitzva to not receive this Light, which refers to Maichut de Malchut. Every %0a> time the sparks are revealed, it is sufficient to let this Light be, to refrain from %0a> receiving it during the 6,000 years. Herein lies its actual correction until, at the %0a> end of correction, the Creator's great Light, called Mashiach (Messiah), manifests %0a> and gives us the strength to receive tithe and offerings for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 449 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Thirteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 246. The thirteenth hlitzva is to perform the redemption of a first-born son so %0a> as to strengthen him in life. For there are two appointed angels in charge— one %0a> over life and one over death. And they both rule over man from Above. And %0a> when man redeems his son, he redeems him from the angel in charge of death, %0a> so that the angel can no longer govern the first-born son. Hence, it is written, %0a> AND THE CREATOR SAW EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD MADE-this %0a> is in general, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS... VERY GOOD alludes to the angel %0a> of life, while the word VERY alludes to the angel of death. Therefore, by this %0a> act of redemption, the angel of life is strengthened and the angel of death is %0a> weakened. Life is purchased by this redemption, for the evil side leaves him be %0a> and clings to him no more. %0a> %0a> The ascent of the worlds occurred on the sixth day of creation: ZA ascended %0a> to the place of AA, Malchut ascended to AVI, and Adam attained Ohr Haya. As %0a> a result, the angel of death (egoism) lost his power completely. On the contrary, %0a> he became very good, for upon being corrected, egoism becomes a great and %0a> holy Kli, the one Kli that can receive the greatest Light. %0a> %0a> Such a state will come at the end of the general correction, when, due to the %0a> revelation of this great Light, death (egoism) will disappear forever. This is the %0a> meaning of the verse: "when the Creator saw EVERYTHING that He had made %0a> (i.e., at the end of all creation), He saw that it was very good." %0a> %0a> However, since Adam's sin, the worlds can no longer ascend as high. This %0a> is why we need special Mitzvot in order to perform special preparations and %0a> actions for the reception of Ohr Haya, at least in a state called Shabbat. This %0a> is precisely the Mitzva to redeem one's first-born son, when we weaken the %0a> powers of the angel of death and strengthen the angel of life, much like what %0a> the Creator did to Adam by the preliminary ascents of all the worlds, for %0a> %0a> 451 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 452 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> during such an ascent, called Shabbat, the angel of death becomes very good. %0a> Such is the power of that Mitzva. %0a> %0a> Yet, it is not observed as fully as previously, when the angel of death lost %0a> all of his power. Now, by observing the Mitzva of redemption of the first-born %0a> son, we merely distance from the angel of death without actually destroying the %0a> impure forces, and they no longer cling to him. And after preventing the impure %0a> forces from clinging, accomplished with the help of this Mitzva, he can receive %0a> life, i.e., Ohr Haya of the state of Shabbat. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 247. The fourteenth Mitzva is to observe Shabbat, which is a day of rest from %0a> all the actions of creation. There are two Mitzvot here: to observe the day of %0a> Shabbat and to adorn its holiness, namely to receive Ohr Hochma, called %0a> "holiness;" and to observe Shabbat as a day of rest for all the worlds, in which %0a> all actions are multiplied and realized even before this day is sanctified. %0a> %0a> Shabbat is a state of the spiritual worlds where the Light descending from %0a> Above elevates ZA to AA, Nukva to AVI, the worlds of BYA to YESHSUT, and %0a> ZON of the world of Atzilut. As a result, man's NRN (whoever has it, whoever is %0a> spiritually present in the worlds of BYA) also ascends to Atzilut with the worlds %0a> of BYA, and there receives Ohr Haya. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA- %0a> %0a> M- %0a> %0a> BYA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It follows that there are two Mitzvot: to refrain from working and carrying %0a> things from one household to another. This is so because when all the worlds %0a> are completely freed from the impure forces, we must guard against the impure %0a> forces, so they do not return and mingle with the holiness of Shabbat. And he %0a> who works causes the impure forces to mingle with the pure ones. %0a> %0a> The second Mitzva is to adorn the day of Shabbat: through the pleasures of %0a> Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds of ABYA), man receives (in his spiritual desires %0a> existing in the world of BYA) the Light of the world of Atzilut from Above. This %0a> Light of Atzilut is called "holiness" (Hochma); hence, man becomes sanctified by it. %0a> %0a> 453 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Atik %0a> %0a> AA %0a> %0a> AVI %0a> %0a> YESHSUT + ZON %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsaofthe World of Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 454 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> All purifications and corrections take place only in our work and struggle %0a> with the impure forces, preventing us from drawing nearer and merging with the %0a> Creator in our properties. It is precisely in the wars with the impure forces that %0a> we extract the sparks of the Light that they swallowed up, and each extraction of %0a> a spark of the Light from the impure forces and its ascent to the world of Atzilut %0a> is defined as independent, individual work. %0a> %0a> In the beginning, these sparks were sorted and extracted from the impure %0a> forces by the Creator Himself. This is described in His actions in the six days of %0a> creation. And when all the extractions of the Light sparks ended, the work was %0a> considered finished, and the corrected state, called Shabbat, arrives; and it is the %0a> day of rest, for there is nothing else to correct. %0a> %0a> Hence, Shabbat is the day (the state when the Light shines in the worlds) %0a> when all the correction work in all the worlds ceases. For every Sbabbat (the %0a> state of ascent in the spiritual worlds to the level of correction of all the impure %0a> forces), the same state of the perfection of creation's first Sbabbat returns and %0a> brings rest to all the worlds of ABYA. All the impure forces become detached, %0a> remote, and return to their place (Tebom Raba— great abyss), and all the worlds %0a> ascend to the world of Atzilut, defined as perfect unity. And we are destined %0a> to receive this holiness, the Light of the world of Atzilut; it descends upon us %0a> through our observance of the two Mitzvot: REMEMBER AND GUARD THE %0a> DAY OF SHABBAT. %0a> %0a> 248. Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodiless spirits was to be %0a> completed. Asks: "Was the Creator unable to delay the sanctification of that %0a> day until the bodies for those spirits were created?" And answers: "The Tree %0a> of Knowledge of Good and Evil contained an evil side that wanted to govern %0a> the world. And many spirits separated and went forth, armed, to clothe in the %0a> bodies of this world." %0a> %0a> Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodies for the spirits was to %0a> be completed. This means that the day had been sanctified before the Creator %0a> had time to create bodies for those spirits. It is written about this on the first %0a> Sbabbat of creation: "And on the seventh day the Creator finished His work, %0a> which He has made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work, which %0a> He has made." %0a> %0a> This passage from the Torah is unclear. For if the Creator completely %0a> finished all His work by Himself, then He left nothing for us to do. After all, %0a> He finished everything Himself. However, the Creator sorted the Light sparks %0a> and separated the pure forces from the impure ones precisely to enable us to do, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 455 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> i.e., to complete this work by making our own efforts in the observance of the %0a> To rah and Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> And the rest that is mentioned here refers only to what the Creator Himself %0a> had to do. Therefore, the Torah says that the Creator finished His work, for %0a> He has completed all the preparations for us, and nothing else is required of %0a> Him, for the rest HE HAS MADE for us to do. This enables us to do and to %0a> complete creation. %0a> %0a> Hence, it is written that the Creator did not have time to create bodies for %0a> the spirits before the arrival of Shabbat. These bodiless spirits constitute all of %0a> our impure and evil forces that drive man to transgressions. And the Creator %0a> intentionally left them this way, for it is precisely because they are present within %0a> us that we have freedom of will in our work with the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> As a result of Adam's sin in Malchut, called "The Tree of Knowledge of %0a> Good and Evil," pure and impure forces were mixed. At that, the impure forces %0a> wished to rule over the forces of good in the world, so the forces of good would %0a> never prevail over them. Thus, a number of armed spirits went forth, intending %0a> to attack the bodies, capture them, and clothe in them. %0a> %0a> Two points merged in Malchut: one was corrected by receiving the properties %0a> of Bina, mercy, and the other is the strictness of judgment, the result of %0a> restrictions within Malchut herself. When Malchut is united with the pure forces, %0a> her property of restriction is concealed, and the point of mercy is revealed (item %0a> 123). Then man is said to merit only goodness. %0a> %0a> However, if man transgresses, he attacks the good point and thereby reveals %0a> the point of restriction in Malchut. Thus, the forces that wish to harm and destroy %0a> the corrected part and to rule over man become revealed, and this is evil. %0a> %0a> However, if he merits for the point of mercy to reveal itself and dominate, %0a> he can elevate Malchut to Bina, thereby causing Supernal mercy and Light to %0a> descend. However, if he does not merit, and the point of restriction is revealed %0a> in Malchut, not only does he thereby harm Malchut, but he also harms the point %0a> of Bina that unites with Malchut. Thus, this point turns from good to evil, %0a> from mercy to judgment, as restriction is revealed in Malchut herself, and every %0a> revealed property dominates. %0a> %0a> This is why the point of judgment was revealed in Malchut after Adam's sin. %0a> By this, Adam damaged the point (property) of Bina that united with Malchut, %0a> too, turning it from mercy to strictness, judgment. Yet, the correction of Malchut %0a> is possible only with the help of this point, for it is called "goodness." And when %0a> this point of Bina is revealed within her, Malchut is called "goodness," too. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 456 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> But now that the very point of Bina in Malchut was damaged and turned %0a> from good to evil, the impure force thought that the time has come for it to %0a> dominate the world and clothe human bodies, meaning Adam and his sons %0a> (spiritual Partzufim). In other words, the body (desires) of the impure force %0a> inherits the place of Adam's body. Thus, the correction of Malchut from the %0a> good point becomes impossible, for no more goodness comes to Malchut from %0a> Bina, and this property has become evil, strictness, and judgment, due to the %0a> restricted reception in Malchut. %0a> %0a> And many armed and destructive impure forces went forth to attack so %0a> as to clothe human bodies (desires) in this world, and rule over them. For the %0a> impure force thought that nothing could protect and save the pure forces from %0a> it because of the harm that Adam's sin brought to the system of governance and %0a> the point of mercy in Malchut. %0a> %0a> 249. However, as the Creator saw this, He roused the wind from within the %0a> Tree of Life, ZA, and struck the other Tree, Malchut. And the other, good %0a> side was awakened, and the day was sanctified. For the creation of bodies and %0a> the awakening of spirits on that night of Shabbat stem from the good side, %0a> and not from the evil one. %0a> %0a> Since the Creator saw the strengthening of the power of judgment and %0a> the impure forces, their ability to clothe the bodies in this world (completely %0a> excluding the possibility of correcting the world in the future), He roused the %0a> wind within the Tree of Life and struck the other Tree (made a Zivug with it), %0a> Malchut. Due to this Zivug, the Tree of Life passed the spirit of life to the other %0a> Tree, Malchut, thus enabling Malchut to tear away from the impure forces. %0a> %0a> As a result, the good side reappeared in Malchut, as it was prior to Adam's %0a> sin, and the sanctity of Shabbat descended to the world. That is, although the %0a> impure forces had the strength to clothe in bodies, and were more powerful %0a> than the pure forces, and, according to the law, they were supposed to prevail, %0a> at that moment the Creator intervened, disregarding the destruction caused %0a> by Adam's sin. %0a> %0a> Consequently, ZON (the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good) %0a> united in a Zivug, as before Adam's sin, and the Light of sanctity of Shabbat %0a> descended into the world. This action of the Creator caused Shabbat (the Light %0a> of Shabbat) to descend into the world, and the impure forces lost the opportunity %0a> to clothe in human bodies in this world. The impure force remained as a bodiless %0a> spirit, which enables man to draw closer to the Creator (with his properties). %0a> This is referred to as his return (Teshuva). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 457 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The creation of bodies and the arousal of spirits on that night of Shabbat %0a> stems from the good side, and not from the side of the impure forces, for the %0a> Creator's action remains in creation forever. Just as on the first Shabbat of %0a> creation, the Creator completely disregarded the damage of Adam's sin, instead %0a> compelling ZON to make a Zivug, and the day was sanctified as before the sin, %0a> for He destroyed all the power of the impure forces, despite the fact that they %0a> had the strength to rule. %0a> %0a> The same applies to all Sbabbatot (plural for Sbabbat)— the spiritual ascents %0a> for those who exist in the worlds of BYA— during the 6,000 years. Although %0a> man is still full of impurity, for he has yet to correct the sins of the Tree of %0a> Knowledge, when he makes a Zivug (of the Light with a screen) on the night of %0a> Sbabbat (in a spiritual state of that name), the impure forces (of man) have no %0a> power over him (his altruistic desires). In this Zivug, man assumes the body and %0a> spirit of a newborn, as though he was unharmed by Adam's sin, as though he %0a> himself corrected the Tree of Knowledge. %0a> %0a> And despite the fact that man has yet to merit liberation from his egoism, %0a> the impure forces have no power over him on that night. Thus, he can receive %0a> the bodies and spirits in his Zivug on the side of the Tree of Good, but not from %0a> the impure forces. %0a> %0a> 250. And had he hastened on that night to put forward the other side, before %0a> the good side came forward, he would not have been able to withstand it for %0a> even an instant. But the Creator provided the remedy in advance. And He %0a> sanctified the day beforehand. And He warned to appear before the other %0a> side. And the world exists. And that the opposite side thought to rule in the %0a> world, i.e., in defiance of it, the good side was created and strengthened on %0a> that night. And the good, holy bodies and spirits were created on that night %0a> from the good side. Therefore, the delight of sages who know this spans from %0a> Shabbat to Shabbat. %0a> %0a> 251. However, when the other (impure) side saw that what it had planned %0a> to do was already done by the holy side, it started to check its own forces %0a> and properties, and saw all those who perform a Zivug naked and in the %0a> candlelight. Therefore, all of the sons born from that Zivug are enslaved by %0a> the spirit of the other side. And these naked spirits of the wicked are called %0a> "harming," and they are ruled and killed by Lilit. %0a> %0a> 252. And since the day was sanctified, and holiness rules in the world, the other %0a> side diminishes itself and hides on each Shabbat day and on each Shabbat %0a> night. With the exception of Asimon and his group, who walk secretly in the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 458 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Candlelight, to observe the naked Zivug. And then they hide inside the cave, %0a> called Tehom Raba (the great abyss). And as soon as Shabbat ends, many %0a> hosts fly and prowl in the world. As a result, everything is corrected by the %0a> song of the sufferers, "He who dwells in concealment," to prevent impurity %0a> from governing holiness. %0a> %0a> According to the law, the impure force was supposed to rule in the world, for %0a> it was stronger than the pure one, and it was to clothe in human bodies. But then, %0a> the earth would have been given over to the wicked, and all the generations in the %0a> world originating from man would have stemmed from the side of the impure %0a> forces. And there would have been no chance of correction, for impurity would %0a> have dominated over all the generations to such an extent that there would have %0a> been no opportunity to get hold of the good side even for a moment. %0a> %0a> However, the Creator provided a remedy, thereby forestalling the defect, for %0a> He elevated Shabbat and removed the impure forces, which caused the Light of %0a> peace and rest to be revealed in all the worlds. And all the impure forces were %0a> thrown into Tehom Raba (the great abyss). Thus, the world was revived, as this %0a> enabled the creation of bodies and spirits from the pure side in a Zivug of the %0a> Shabbat night, and the world advances toward the desired goal. %0a> %0a> So what does it mean to forestall the defect via a remedy? The whole of %0a> creation is based on a cause and effect sequence, and all that transpires not %0a> according to the worlds' development is called "forestalling" (skipping several %0a> degrees, bypassing some of the causes and effects in this chain). %0a> %0a> And since the sanctity of Shabbat came as an awakening from Above, from the %0a> Creator's desire, without any desire or request from below, for Adam had yet to %0a> make any corrections and draw closer to the Creator in order to merit Shabbat (when %0a> the Creator Himself prevented the defect by providing a remedy for the correction %0a> of the world), this action on the Creator's behalf is called "forestalling." %0a> %0a> Just as the impure force planned to assume power over the world, the good %0a> side forestalled its actions on that night. For this night that followed the sin %0a> in the Tree of Knowledge was given entirely to the impure forces. Hence, they %0a> thought that they would obviously rule over the world. However, the opposite %0a> had happened— sanctity took their place: pure bodies and spirits were created %0a> on that night by the good side. This is because such a preparation took place %0a> that all the Zivugim on that night created bodies and spirits from the good side, %0a> without any participation of the impure force. In other words, what transpired %0a> was exactly the opposite of the impure force's expectations. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the time of sages who know this spans from Shabbat to Shabbat— %0a> for at this time, bodies and spirits are created from the pure, good side. And %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 459 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> when the impure force sees that what it wanted to create was created by the %0a> opposite side, it collects its evil powers and searches through the whole world, %0a> and sees all those who make a Zivug in the candlelight, exposing their naked %0a> bodies. And ill sons are made from this Zivug. The impure side sends these %0a> sons its evil spirits of the wicked, called "wreckers." As a result, they are ruled %0a> and killed by Lilit. Garments refer to Ohr Hassadim, the garments of Ima, the %0a> intention "for the sake of the Creator." %0a> %0a> When the sanctity of Shabbat comes into the world, and Shabbat rules in the %0a> world, the power of the impure force dwindles and hides on the night and on %0a> the day of Shabbat. Hence, this is the time of sages. %0a> %0a> And only the wreckers, called "Asimon and his group," walk secretly in the %0a> candlelight, to observe those who expose their Zivug. Afterward, they hide in %0a> the ~Nukva of Tehom Raba. Thus, although Asimon has the power to see the Zivug %0a> in the candlelight and on Shabbat, he cannot do harm on Shabbat, but must %0a> immediately return to the Nukva of Tehom Raba. Only after Shabbat is over can %0a> he resume causing harm. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Shimon felt the difficulty of explaining the words regarding Shabbat %0a> being the time of sages. For each day (not only on Shabbat night), starting at %0a> midnight, the Creator walks around the Garden of Eden and makes Zivugim with %0a> the sages. The Zohar asks the same question (Veyikahel, item 194), and answers %0a> that there is a difference between a Zivug on a week night and one that is made %0a> in the candlelight on Shabbat. On weekdays, the impure force has the power to %0a> inflict maladies on the newborns, and Lilit has the power to kill them. %0a> %0a> However, on Shabbat nights, although the wrecker Asimon and his group are %0a> present, he has not the power to harm, but only after Shabbat is over. However, %0a> opposite his opportunity to cause harm after Shabbat there exists a correction, %0a> called Havdalah, the separation of Shabbat from the weekdays through a blessing, %0a> a prayer, and a cup of wine, which completely annul the power of this wrecker. %0a> Hence, there is a significant difference between a Zivug on a week night and a %0a> Zivug on the night of Shabbat. %0a> %0a> The thing is that there is a source of Light, ZA, Supernal unity, and a source %0a> of fire, Malchut, lower unity (item 209). Also, there are three details in the %0a> candle flame (this refers to a spiritual candle, designated in corporeality by a %0a> wick floating in olive oil): %0a> %0a> - White Upper flame; %0a> %0a> - Lower flame; %0a> %0a> - The coarse part— wick and oil, supporting the lower flame. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 460 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This lower flame is called "devouring flame." It designates judgment, the %0a> power of restriction in the candle. Thus, it devours everything below it, the wick %0a> and the oil. And the Upper white flame signifies mercy contained in the candle, %0a> for white means mercy. %0a> %0a> And he who makes a Zivug in the candlelight will see his children damaged, %0a> and Lilit will be able to kill them, for the candle contains the strictness of %0a> judgment, and the impure forces can therefore cling to such a Zivug. Due to the %0a> strictness of judgment, their bodies (the impurities contained in the bodies that %0a> participate in a Zivug, each of which finds what suits them) become revealed. %0a> %0a> Therefore, a Zivug is permitted only at midnight, i.e., only in the darkness, %0a> when there is absolutely no Light, when Malchut is said to "awaken at night," and %0a> mercy is revealed. However, if there is some candlelight, it reveals the impurity %0a> in the bodies, and the impure forces cling to them. %0a> %0a> In the candlelight, the impure force sees impurity in the bodies of those %0a> making a Zivug, and it informs on them and clings to their bodies. However, all %0a> the restrictions of strictness and judgment disappear on the night of Shabbat, %0a> and the coarse lower flame becomes like the white Upper flame. This means %0a> that even candlelight is permitted. Moreover, under the influence of the sanctity %0a> of Shabbat, all the impurity disappears from man's body, hence there is no fear %0a> to reveal the body in the candlelight. %0a> %0a> Yet, even on Shabbat, when the coarse flame turns white and the judgment %0a> of restrictions disappears, the white flame of the candle nonetheless requires %0a> the light's coarse part, so it would act as foundation. And the coarse foundation %0a> designates an indispensable presence of judgment and restrictions, for coarseness %0a> constitutes restriction. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, these restrictions do not appear on Shabbat. This resembles %0a> a coin without any image, so its denomination is unknown. Therefore, the %0a> wrecker, this coarse, detrimental part of the candle that supports the white %0a> flame, is called Asimon (Hebrew, Token), signifying a coin without image. %0a> %0a> The coarse part of the candle secretly ascends along with the white %0a> candlelight, as the candle cannot burn without it. Hence, this coarse part sees %0a> the exposed Zivug and can therefore do harm after the end of Shabbat. Although %0a> the revelation (exposure) of bodies does no harm on the night of Shabbat (the %0a> impurity of the body remains concealed during Shabbat), as soon as Shabbat is %0a> over, the impure force can reveal itself and harm. %0a> %0a> And since, after Shabbat, Asimon and his group return to their forms %0a> (properties) and rise up from the Great Abyss (Tehom Raba) to the place of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 461 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> settlement, they soar above the world and can cause harm. There is a song: %0a> "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One," for man saves himself from %0a> harmful forces by praying and returning to the Creator: %0a> %0a> "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One (dwells under the shelter of %0a> the Supernal One) dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord: %0a> 'my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you %0a> from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with %0a> his feathers, and under his wings will you find refuge; his faithfulness will be %0a> your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that %0a> flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that %0a> destroys at midday. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right %0a> hand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and %0a> see the punishment of the wicked..." (Tehilim, 91:1-8). %0a> %0a> 253. What places do they visit on the night of the end of Shabbat 7 . When they %0a> come out in haste and wish to govern the holy nation, they see it standing in %0a> prayer and singing this song: "He who sits in the shadow (concealment) of the %0a> Supernal One," first separating Shabbat from the weekdays in his prayer, and %0a> then over a cup of wine, these forces flee thence and fly away to the desert. %0a> May the Merciful One save us from them and from the evil side. %0a> %0a> Here the question concerns only the night of the end of Shabbat, but not %0a> the night of weekdays, as the night of the end of Shabbat still contains some %0a> force of the sanctity of Shabbat. Hence, although the impure forces rise from %0a> Tebom Raba and fly to conquer Israel, when they see Israel's actions in song of %0a> prayer and in the blessing over a cup of wine, they fly away to the wasteland, an %0a> unpopulated place. Thus, people escape their reach. %0a> %0a> It follows that impure forces dwell in three places: %0a> %0a> - On Sbabbat, they dwell in Nukva of Tebom Raba and have no power to %0a> cause harm; %0a> %0a> - When Sbabbat is over, they are kept in the wasteland with the help %0a> of prayer, Havdalah, separation of Sbabbat from weekdays, and the %0a> blessing over a cup of wine. They have the power to cause harm, but %0a> can't, as they are in an unpopulated place; %0a> %0a> - On other nights they are also present in populated places. %0a> %0a> 254. The three that cause evil to themselves: a) he who curses himself; b) he %0a> who throws away bread or bread crumbs bigger than an olive; c) he who lights %0a> the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel attains sanctity in the prayer, %0a> "And You are holy." And the light from that candle ignites hellfire. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 462 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 255. There is a place in hell for those who transgress Shabbat. And as they are %0a> punished in hell, they curse him who lit the candle before its time, and they %0a> say to him, "Behold: the Creator will thrust you about with a mighty throw, %0a> and He will seize you firmly. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into %0a> a large land; there shall you die" (Yeshayahu, 22:17-18). %0a> %0a> One wrecker is called the "evil eye." And he loves cursing, as it is said; %0a> "Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, %0a> and it is far from him" (Tehilim, 109:17). When man curses himself, he thereby %0a> empowers the evil eye to love cursing, and it rules over him— thus, man brings %0a> harm to himself. %0a> %0a> There is nothing in this world that does not have an Upper Root Above. %0a> Especially bread, on which man's life depends, has its own special root Above. %0a> Therefore, he who neglects his bread brings harm to the root of his life Above. %0a> Everyone understands this, but only to the extent of the portion that satiates %0a> him, giving him life. %0a> %0a> However, if a piece of bread and crumbs are smaller than an olive, there %0a> are those who neglect and throw them away, as such amount cannot satiate %0a> man. Yet, the sages instructed us to bless as a meal even an olive-sized amount %0a> of bread, obliging us to treat such portion as satiating, so we have no right to %0a> neglect such an amount. And he who neglects it brings harms to himself. %0a> %0a> The reason for this is explained in the Talmud: "They asked the Creator: %0a> Master of the world, it is said in your Torah that one should not turn his face %0a> and accept bribes. Yet, You turn Your face to Israel..." The Creator replied: %0a> "How can I help turning my face to Israel if they observe the law 'down to the %0a> size of an olive...'" (Berachot, 20:2). In other words, by accepting an olive-sized %0a> bread crumb as a satiating meal, we merit revealing the Creator's face, even %0a> though we are unworthy of it. Therefore, those who neglect the amount of bread %0a> the size of an olive and do not consider it a satiating meal do not merit revealing %0a> the Creator's face; hence, they bring harm to themselves. %0a> %0a> He who lights the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel has reached %0a> sanctity in the blessing, thereby ignites hellfire. This is because prior to that %0a> moment, it was Shabbat; its sanctity prevailed, and hellfire has no power on %0a> Shabbat. Hence, he who transgresses Shabbat and lights the candle prematurely, %0a> Ignites hellfire and brings harm to himself, for the transgression of Sbabbat is %0a> regarded as the gravest transgression. Hence, there is a special place in hell for %0a> those who transgress Sbabbat. And they who are punished in hell curse the %0a> sinner for igniting hellfire prematurely. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Fourteenth Commandment %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 463 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 256. For he should not light the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel %0a> separates Shabbat from the weekdays in their prayer and over a cup of wine, %0a> as until that time, it is still Shabbat, and the sanctity of Shabbat still rules %0a> over us. And during the separation by means of blessing over a cup, all those %0a> hosts and legions that the rulers appointed to govern the weekdays return %0a> each to their place to resume the work for which they are responsible. %0a> %0a> The main prohibition remains in effect only until the blessing in the prayer. %0a> Nevertheless, one should beware of lighting a candle before the actual separation %0a> of Shabbat from the weekdays in the blessings over a cup, as it is still Shabbat. %0a> Of course, one can light a candle for the actual separation of Shabbat from the %0a> weekdays, i.e., for the blessing over a lit candle. %0a> %0a> 257. As soon as Shabbat starts and the day is sanctified, holiness awakens %0a> and rules over the world; the power of weekdays disappears and returns only %0a> when Shabbat ends. However, although Shabbat is over, other forces do not %0a> regain their power until Israel says the prayer, "He who separates holiness %0a> from the weekdays." Only then does holiness disappear, and the legions that %0a> govern the weekdays awaken and return to their places, each to its above- %0a> appointed post. %0a> %0a> 258. Nevertheless, the impure forces do not assume control until the flame %0a> of the candle is lit, for they all come from the root (element) of fire, from %0a> which everything originates, and they descend to rule over the lower world. %0a> All this happens if one lights the candle before Israel has finished the blessing %0a> in the prayer. %0a> %0a> Malchut is called the "pillar of fire" (item 209), and the forces that exist in %0a> the candlelight are the restrictions in Malchut. It is impossible to use these forces %0a> before the candle is lit. %0a> %0a> 259. Yet, if he waits until they complete the blessing, the wicked in hell justify the %0a> Creator's justice over them, and they bring upon him all the blessings, recited %0a> by the congregation: "Therefore, the Creator gives you of the dew of Heaven," %0a> "Blessed shall you be in your town," and "Blessed shall you be in the field." %0a> %0a> By reciting the blessings, we evoke the descent of the great Light, and its %0a> power saves us from hell. And since the wicked in hell see this, they regret %0a> committing their sins and justify the Creator's judgment brought upon them %0a> by seeing their punishment. And since man evoked such justification of the %0a> Creator's judgment, all the blessings, recited at the end of Shabbat by the %0a> congregation become fulfilled in him. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 464 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 260. "Blessed is he who considers the poor; the Creator will deliver him in the %0a> day of disaster" (Tehilim, 41:2). What do the words "in the day of disaster" %0a> mean? This refers to the day when evil gains power and wants to take his soul %0a> away from him. The word "poor" alludes to someone very sick. "He who %0a> considers" refers to one who realizes the need to be cured from transgressions %0a> before the Creator. Another explanation is that this is the Day of Judgment in %0a> the world. "He who considers" signifies one who knows how to save himself %0a> from it, as it is written: "The Creator will deliver him in the day of disaster," %0a> meaning that on the day when the judgment against man dominates the %0a> world, the Creator will deliver him. %0a> %0a> "The day of disaster" is a state when the impure forces, called "evil," govern %0a> man and take his soul away. "He who considers the poor" is one who tells %0a> the sick to return to the Creator to correct himself. It is him who the Creator %0a> delivers from the rule of the impure forces. %0a> %0a> The Zohar continues by saying that there are three sources of evil for the soul %0a> of a man that attracts it onto himself. Hence, it advises one who considers and %0a> is compassionate to the poor, to appeal to the sick man's heart (he who feels %0a> sick in his own evil, egoism) to return to the Creator. Then the Creator will cure %0a> him. And on this day of disaster, which man caused to his soul, the Creator will %0a> deliver him through this reward. %0a> %0a> Even if judgment dominates the world, the Creator will deliver him, for %0a> he taught the sick to return to the Creator and explained to them the need for %0a> correction. And the difference in the explanations is that the first refers to an %0a> individual who discovers evil within himself, and the second refers to the evil %0a> of the entire world. And here, the Creator, too, will deliver man as a reward for %0a> fulfilling this Mitzva. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Intention in the Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It is written in The Zohar (Veyikahel, pp. 32-52): "Each day a voice calls upon %0a> all people in the world, 'This depends on you. Separate a part of yourself and %0a> devote it to the Creator.'" At some point in life, thoughts and desires to draw %0a> closer to the spiritual come to every person, and it depends on us whether or %0a> not we heed that inner call. The voice reassures man that by casting aside his %0a> needless, transient, and earthly desires, by ceasing his endless chase for their %0a> appeasement, he will attain true and eternal happiness. %0a> %0a> From this we can understand the secret meaning of prayer: he who fears %0a> the Creator and directs his heart and desires in his prayer, carries out great %0a> and exalted corrections. If one wishes to enter the spiritual realm and feel the %0a> eator, the only thing he must do is pray, i.e., ask the Creator to correct %0a> , to transform it from the nature of our world (egoistic) into the n %0a> iritual realm (altruistic). He will then enter eternity and trans %0a> e boundaries of our world. Being completely enslaved by his egoism, man %0a> nable to change himself on his own. %0a> %0a> To correct himself, man needs to receive the strength that exists outside of %0a> him, beyond the bounds of his egoism. He must ask to receive this strength %0a> hence, the only thing man must do is pray. %0a> %0a> However, prayer is not uttered by one's mouth. Rather, it is the desire in our %0a> heart, for the Creator reads the desires in our hearts. Therefore, man's only task %0a> to transform his heart's desires— for his heart to wish to change its own desires %0a> %0a> it by himself; he must ask the Creator for it. %0a> %0a> to exalting the Creator's rule, faith in Hi %0a> gularity, His power, His ability and desire to help. All of man's effor %0a> create the only true desire within him— to feel the Creator! Here, The Zohar. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 465 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 466 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ready attained the spiritual worlds with their desires and properties, and, %0a> ;ing in our world, perceive and exist in the two worlds simultaneously. %0a> The prayer the book refers to here constitutes the spiritual actions of one who %0a> has already acquired spiritual instruments, and can utilize them in exactly the %0a> same way we use our hands and auxiliary means in our world. %0a> %0a> First, in the songs and hymns of the Supernal angels, and according to the %0a> order of chants sung by the sons of Israel below, Malchut adorns and corrects %0a> herself as a wife who adorns herself for her husband. The sons of Israel are those %0a> who wish to become Yashar (straight) and El (Creator), i.e., to draw closer to, %0a> or go straight to the Creator. Such people, who exist in the Upper Worlds with %0a> their spiritual (altruistic) instruments (desires), can change the states of Higher %0a> Sefirot and worlds by their spiritual actions. %0a> %0a> Our prayer-book was compiled by the sages of the Great Assembly twenty %0a> centuries ago. Before that, everyone addressed the Creator in accordance with %0a> what he or she felt. About twenty centuries ago, coarser souls began descendin %0a> )ur world, which needed orderly prayers. Hence, the members of the ( %0a> )ly (great Kabbalists) created the prayer book that we still use today. %0a> %0a> rderly fashion, the prayer book expounds all the consecutive %0a> lan's correction. Behind the words of the prayer book, one who understands %0a> sees the spiritual actions that he needs to perform. This information is conveyed %0a> in letters, in their forms and combinations, as well as in the sequence of senteno %0a> and parts of the whole prayer. %0a> %0a> According to the order of the prayer, correction of the worlds comes first %0a> by the morning blessings (See Tefilat Kol Peh) up to the prayer of Shmone Esreh, %0a> correction in a sitting position. Then, when they reach the words Emet ve Yatziv %0a> that conclude Kriyat Shema, all the worlds achieve correction. And as they reach %0a> the words Gaal Israel, all the corrections are to take their places; hence, they %0a> continue reciting the Shmone Esreh prayer while standing. %0a> %0a> In spirituality (and, consequently, in corporeality) a person can be in one %0a> of three states: lying, sitting, or standing. A newborn infant in our world and %0a> a spiritually newborn person develop in the same order. Lying means that the %0a> position of the head, the legs, and the body are at the same level. In the spiritual, %0a> this corresponds to the embryonic state, when all that exists in the ten Sefirot is %0a> the same. This is the lowest spiritual state. %0a> %0a> Sitting means that the head is above the body, and the body is above the %0a> legs, but one cannot use his legs. Such a state is called Katnut (smallness) or VAK. %0a> Standing implies absolute distinction between the levels of the head, body, and %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Intention in the Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 467 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> legs. It is called Gadlut (big state) or GAR. Thus, according to one's ability to ask %0a> for correction, he gradually receives strength from the Creator and grows. %0a> %0a> Therefore, when he reaches the words Emet ve Yatziv, everything has already %0a> been corrected: all of the worlds bear Malchut in them, while Malchut herself %0a> bears the Supernal King. When man reaches the words, Gaal Israel, the Supernal %0a> King advances along the degrees, along the three lines, and comes forward to %0a> receive Malchut. %0a> %0a> The Supernal King (the Creator), with regard to all created beings, constitutes %0a> ZA of the world of Atzilut, for Malchut de Atzilut is the sum of all creations. %0a> Everything that was ever created, including us and all the worlds with all that %0a> inhabit them, is a part of Malchut. %0a> %0a> In our initial state, we are the parts of Malchut that receive the smallest %0a> portion of the Creator's Light, Ner Dalcilc (tiny candle). As we draw closer to the %0a> Creator in our properties (making them similar to His), we receive increasingly %0a> greater Light, in proportion to our advancement, which we feel as infinite bliss, %0a> peace, delight, eternity, and as a life-force. %0a> %0a> The degrees of our closeness to the Creator (our "I" and Him, Malchut %0a> and ZA) are described in Kabbalah using a special language: the nearing of %0a> properties is considered a transition from the state of "back to back" between ZA %0a> and Malchut to the state of "face to face." The souls' union with the Creator is %0a> described as a Zivug— sexual act between ZA and Malchut, whereupon ZA passes %0a> the Light to Malchut, and each soul, in proportion to its correction, can thereby %0a> receive this Light. %0a> %0a> Naturally, the Creator remains in a state of absolute rest, and all His alleged %0a> movements are felt with regard to Malchut, depending on the changes in her %0a> properties. At times she feels Him more and at times less, and she perceives this %0a> as His movement toward her. %0a> %0a> We must stand in humility and awe before the Supernal King, each in his %0a> place, for He extends His right hand to Malchut in Magen Abraham, the first %0a> blessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the right line. Then He puts His %0a> left hand under the head of Malchut, as it is written: "Let his left hand be under %0a> my head, and his right hand embrace me" (Shir HaShirim, 2:6) in the blessing Ata %0a> Gibor, the second blessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the left line. %0a> %0a> The entire magnificent Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) speaks of the Supernal %0a> merging of all the creatures with the Creator. Since our world is created as a %0a> reflection of the spiritual world, spiritual merging can only be described with the %0a> corresponding words of our world. Because our world is egoistic, the spiritual, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 468 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> altruistic actions, directed toward the merging of properties and desires, are %0a> described in the words of our world as Malchut (man's soul) drawing closer to the %0a> Creator in her properties, followed by their gradual unification. First, it manifests %0a> in the form of an embrace, followed by a kiss, then a coition, when the soul is %0a> sufficiently corrected to receive the Light (Ohr Hochma) from the Creator. %0a> %0a> Afterward, ZA and Malchut embrace and unite in a kiss of the blessing %0a> HaEl HaKadosh, designating the middle line. From this state and higher on, %0a> everything transpires in the state of a kiss, up to the last three blessings in the %0a> Shmone Esreh prayer. This is the spiritual, true meaning of the first three blessings %0a> of the Shmone Esreh prayer. %0a> %0a> In other words, if one is able to make a spiritual action that corresponds to %0a> the conditions described in these blessings, he attains unity with the Creator %0a> that it is called "embrace" and "kiss." The detailed explanation of the spiritual %0a> actions is given in The Study of the Ten Sefirot by Rabbi Ashlag. The language of %0a> The Zohar and the Torah describes these actions with words of our world. %0a> %0a> The language of Kabbalah describes them by using the names of Sefirot, %0a> Partzufim, and Lights. The most complete and precise language for the description %0a> of spiritual actions is the language of Sefirot. Therefore, this was the language %0a> chosen by Kabbalists for their inner work and for explaining to us the practice %0a> and method of spiritual ascent. %0a> %0a> Man must aspire to the Creator in his heart and desires in order to acquire %0a> the intentions that bring him to correction in all the spiritual states described in %0a> this prayer— for his mouth and his heart (desires) to become a single whole, so his %0a> lips will not speak against the wishes of his heart. The Creator awaits only the %0a> sincerity of our desires so as to fulfill them at once and bring us closer to Him: %0a> %0a> Beloved of the soul, Compassionate Father! %0a> Draw Your servant to Your will. %0a> %0a> Your servant will hurry like a hart, will how before Your majesty. %0a> %0a> To him Your friendship will he sweeter %0a> %0a> Than the dripping of the honeycomb and any taste. %0a> %0a> Majestic, Beautiful Radiance of the universe! %0a> My soul pines for Your love. %0a> %0a> Please O God, heal her now showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. %0a> Then she will be strengthened and healed %0a> And eternal gladness will be hers. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Intention in the Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 469 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> All-worthy One, may Your mercy be aroused %0a> And please take pity on the son of Your beloved. %0a> %0a> Because it is so very long that I have yearned intensely to see the splendor of strength. %0a> These my heart desires, and please take pity and do not conceal Yourself. %0a> %0a> Please be revealed and spread upon me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace. %0a> Illuminate the land with Your glory, we shall rejoice and be glad in You. %0a> Make haste, do love, for the time has come, and pardon us as in days of old. %0a> %0a> (Song Yedid Nefesh) %0a> %0a> When the Creator and Malchut merge in a kiss, he who needs advice and %0a> assistance can ask for it, for this state is called the "time of desire." And since %0a> man appealed before the King and Queen in the twelve intermediate blessings %0a> of the Shmone Esreh prayer, he thereby corrected and prepared his heart's desires %0a> for the last three blessings. He aroused the Creator's desire for him, for thanks %0a> to these last three blessings, he merges with the Creator in Supernal Unity. %0a> %0a> The "time of desire" is an appropriate state for making requests and receiving %0a> the answer— the strength for self-correction. The King and Queen are ZA and %0a> Malchut. Each blessing constitutes a sequence of individual corrections of man's %0a> soul. Consequently, man ascends to a Higher spiritual level. Thus, he gradually %0a> attains Supernal Unity with the Creator. %0a> %0a> Then, he must fall on his face, and when Malchut holds the souls within %0a> her, submit his soul to the Creator's absolute power, as this is the appropriate %0a> time (state) to entrust one's soul amongst all the other souls, for Malchut is the %0a> source of life. %0a> %0a> To fall on one's face and entrust one's soul means that man has but a %0a> single desire— to completely rid himself of his egoistic desires, and receive the %0a> Creator's altruistic desires in their stead. Upon receiving the Creator's desires, %0a> man becomes similar to Him, and to the extent of his similarity, he merges with %0a> the Creator. By merging with the Creator, man acquires all that the Creator has: %0a> immortality, complete knowledge of all creation, might, and perfection. %0a> %0a> The secret of the Light is available only to the chosen ones: when Malchut %0a> holds human souls by her single desire to merge with the Creator (because the %0a> same desire fills man's heart), he submits himself entirely to the aspiration for %0a> this merging, so as to include his soul in the collective merging between Malchut %0a> and the Creator. And if his soul is received by the Creator, man instantly merges %0a> with Him and enters the source of life (Tzror HaChaim), both in this world and %0a> in the world to come. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 470 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> piritual %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ough Kabbalah is considered a secret teaching, it holds no seer %0a> as secret only by those who are yet unable to create the spirit %0a> organs within themselves with which to perceive their surroundings. We are %0a> the only ones who conceal our surroundings from ourselves in default c %0a> corresponding sensory organs. %0a> %0a> The King (Creator, ZA) and Queen (Malchut) must be connected to the souls %0a> on all sides, Above and below, and be adorned with the souls of the righteous %0a> (those who wish to merge with the Creator, entrust their souls to Him). And if %0a> man directs all the intentions of his heart (desires) to this goal and completely %0a> submits his soul to the Creator's will, the Creator makes peace and a covenant %0a> with him (both in the Upper Covenant, called Yesod, and in the lower covenant). %0a> He blesses Malchut by this peace and covenant, and surrounds her on all sides. %0a> %0a> Unity on all sides means that the souls attain similarity with the Creator %0a> in all their properties. The righteous are those who want to merge with the %0a> Creator, attain the entire creation, and as a result, discover the righteousness of %0a> Creator, who created and thus governs them. Those who wish to justify %0a> %0a> "righteous." %0a> %0a> gh they have not yet reached this state and are only er %0a> if only at the very beginning of their path, and they are yet to corre %0a> even a single desire and only feel the smallest aspiration to draw closer %0a> the Creator, they are already called "righteous," after this desire. The Creator %0a> surrounds Malchut on all sides, and Malchut feels Him with all of her corrected %0a> properties, sensations. %0a> %0a> Thus, man also receives the name Shalom (peace), for he has made a covenant %0a> with Malchut below, similar to the covenant of the Sefira Yesod Above. And when %0a> such a man leaves our world, his soul rises through all the Heavens and none %0a> stand in its way, and the Creator calls for it and says: "Let Peace come." The soul %0a> reveals the thirteen elevations of the holy peach and no one stands in its way. %0a> Hence, happy is he who makes an offering to the Creator. %0a> %0a> As soon as the soul tears itself from egoism altogether, it completely merges %0a> with the Creator and is no longer obliged to descend into this world, clothe in a %0a> physical body, and receive an additional portion of egoistic desires. An offering %0a> to the Creator signifies rejection of the body's egoistic desires; it is called a %0a> "sacrifice," for our body is no different from that of an animal. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the aspiration to rid oneself of the animate body and its desires %0a> is called an "offering." Depending on the kind of desires man is already able %0a> to wish to rid himself of, his offering takes the form of a bird (one part of his %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Intention in the Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 471 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> desires) or cattle (another part). Certain parts of The Zohar and some of the %0a> ARI's compositions discuss this matter in great detail. %0a> %0a> Rabbi Chiya raised his voice: "Oh, Rabbi Shimon, you are alive, and I was %0a> already mourning over you! Yet, it is not you that I mourn for, but for all my %0a> friends and for the whole world that will remain orphans after you." Rabbi %0a> Shimon is like a torchlight, shining both Above and below. With this Light %0a> below, he illuminates the whole world. Woe unto this world when this Light will %0a> leave it and rise up Above. Who will shine in this world with the Light of the %0a> Torah? Rabbi Aba rose, kissed Rabbi Chiya, and said, "If such words are within %0a> you, I thank the Creator for sending me to you, so that I could be closer to you. %0a> How happy I am with my lot!" %0a> %0a> All of the characters described in The Zohar are spiritual objects, Partzufim. As %0a> does the whole Torah, The Zohar speaks only of things that exist in the spiritual %0a> worlds, rather than in our world. Therefore, all of the objects, animals, plants, %0a> and people described in The Book of Zohar constitute spiritual degrees, desires, %0a> and Partzufim. %0a> %0a> Creator deliberately sends into our world special souls that are close to %0a> elp all the others to attain the spiritual in this lifetime, while they are %0a> in this world. These great Kabbalists serve as guides for those who have realiz %0a> %0a> Rabbi Yehudah said after him: When the Creator told Moshe to choose %0a> among the people those who are wise and understanding, Moshe looked at the %0a> people and could not find any. Then he was instructed to pick the heads of the %0a> tribes who were known for their wisdom. The word "understanding" is not used %0a> here, for the degree of the understanding is higher than that of the wise. What is %0a> the difference between one who is wise and one who understands? Wise is one %0a> who learns from a Rav (Teacher) and wants to attain wisdom. Wise is one who %0a> knows all that he has to know. %0a> %0a> He who understands consists of several levels-degrees, for he sees into every %0a> thing and knows for himself and for others. The mark of him who understands %0a> is formulated in the phrase: "The righteous one knows his animal soul." The %0a> righteous one signifies Yesod that passes the Light to Malchut (animal), for the %0a> Gematria of HaVaYaH of Malchut is fifty-two = BON = BeHeMaH (beast) = Bet- %0a> HeyMem-Hey = 2 + 5 + 40 + 5 = 52. %0a> %0a> Malchut constitutes the level called "wise at heart," as wisdom is found %0a> within the heart. But he who understands, sees Above and below, for himself %0a> and for others. He who is wise designates Malchut, for it is Malchut that reveals %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 472 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> wisdom. He who understands is Yesod that stands above Malchut. Ohr Hochma %0a> in Malchut shines only from below upwards. It is impossible to receive the Light %0a> from Above downwards, as it would surely enter egoistic desires. Therefore, it %0a> is said that the wise (Hacham) sees only for himself, from himself upwards, and %0a> cannot pass the Light to others below. %0a> %0a> It is hence said that wisdom is found within the heart, as the heart receives %0a> from below upwards; whereas he who understands (the Sefira Yesod, Tzadik, %0a> the righteous one) shines with the Light of Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, from Above %0a> downwards. He sees that he receives for himself, and shines upon the others, i.e., %0a> shines upon Malchut, as it is written: "The righteous knows his animal soul." %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Here The Zohar speaks about the prayer, which every man offers his Creator %0a> (Veyikahel, pp. 32-52). This inner action of man constitutes his greatest and most %0a> valuable work in his efforts for the Creator's sake. %0a> %0a> The Creator made man at the farthest, completely opposite spiritual le %0a> His: with only the egoistic will to enjoy. And since man has no other properti %0a> desires but the egoistic will to receive pleasure, not only is he unable to chang- %0a> himself, he cannot even wish for the desire to change. %0a> %0a> We can change only under the influence of the Creator's Light, by receivin %0a> His properties from Him. Hence our only task is to cultivate a desire to change. %0a> As soon as this true desire appears within man, the Creator will immediately %0a> jive him the strength needed for its realization. So the problem is not how %0a> %0a> )rayer; it is, rather, how to attain it, how to formulate one's reque %0a> le strength to become like the Creator! %0a> %0a> A prayer is a sensation, a desire in one's heart. Man does not re; %0a> completely and cannot describe it, for the sensation in one's heart is %0a> not subject to any control and conscious correction— it cannot be "created" by %0a> one's own will. The sensations in one's heart constitute the consequence of %0a> man's mental and spiritual condition, the result of the current degree of his %0a> spiritual development. %0a> %0a> Thus, the desire to change is also in the Creator's hands. However, He %0a> us the opportunity to stimulate this process and to determine our own %0a> lal advancement: %0a> %0a> )balists to write books, and when we read them %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lows %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> develop the desire to draw closer to Him; %0a> - He allows some of the true Kabbalists to be revealed to a wide circle %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 473 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 474 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Indiscernibly, He transforms our desires (modifies our souls) so %0a> lly take an interest in spirituality; %0a> %0a> le changes our desires with regard to this world, helping us realize %0a> insignificance and transience through sensations of disappoint %0a> md suffering. %0a> %0a> 3y creating man a worthless egoist, i.e., by making a worthless creation that %0a> is seemingly so unbefitting Him, the Creator allowed man to create himself and %0a> elevate himself to an equal degree to that of the Creator Himself— to attain His %0a> svel of perfection. Thus, the Creator reveals the perfection of His creatior %0a> y\i He created man a worthless creature, He thereby enables him to ma %0a> Creator" of himself (in his properties). %0a> %0a> innot claim that although he is created with only one desire %0a> unable to induce the reception of an altruistic desire instead of his natura %0a> egoistic one. The Torah, Kabbalah, teachers, and suffering are all prepared to %0a> accelerate his advancement toward the goal of creation by the path of the Torah, %0a> or otherwise, the path of suffering. %0a> %0a> However, the path of suffering is not only undesirable for man, whose life %0a> on earth makes him feel as though he is caught between the millstones %0a> tirelessly revolving mill. Ruthlessly and methodically, it pulverizes hir %0a> mentally and physically, to the very last day of his life. But this painful path is %0a> equally undesirable in the eyes of the Creator. After all, His goal is to delight %0a> man, which is in accord with the path of the Torah— a quick and painless way to %0a> transform our desires from egoistic into altruistic. %0a> %0a> Since only the Creator can accomplish this (and He will, either painfully %0a> or painlessly, in accord with our conscious request), the development of sue! %0a> request toward Him is all that man must do in his life. It is hence written: "I %0a> him pray all day long!" Yet, we now understand that this phrase does not spe %0a> of sitting over a prayer-book, but refers to man's inner work on himself. %0a> %0a> There are various forms of work that man must do in action, with his body, %0a> as in the case of physically observing the Mitzvot. And then there is man's inner, %0a> most important work, when observance of the Mitzvot depends on the words %0a> and desires of the heart. %0a> %0a> Never does Kabbalah allude to or even mention our physical body, for it %0a> is no different from the body of an animal— it is born, functions, and dies as %0a> an animal. And all the various forms of work that the body performs are mere %0a> mechanical actions utterly unconnected to man's inner intention, and can even %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> nose me %0a> nes of a %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 475 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> fore, the body's actions are completely disregarded in Kabba %0a> 's desire is taken into account and is regarded as an action. In itself %0a> d off the physical body (in which it presently exists), it constitutes %0a> iritual action. %0a> %0a> lal world is a world of incorporeal desires that have no voh %0a> size, movement, or time. Just as in our imagination, where our desires are %0a> fulfilled instantly by the power of thought, everything in the spiritual world is %0a> determined only by our desires-thoughts, and not by physical actions. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, since in this world we temporarily exist in a physiological body, %0a> our task is to observe the Creator's Mitzvot both physically (with our body) and %0a> spiritually. Physically, we can observe them, as a person usually does— because %0a> of his upbringing or for a reward in this world (money, health, luck, peace, and %0a> so forth) or in the world to come (the best that he can imagine). Alternatively, %0a> he performs these actions because he was taught from childhood to do so %0a> mechanically, so he cannot avoid doing them in view of the acquired desire %0a> (instinct)— if he does not do them, he suffers. %0a> %0a> This feeling of suffering is exactly what compels him to carry out the %0a> mechanical actions of the Mitzvot. It is not even the desire to receive a reward %0a> in this world or in the world to come: in this case, the reward is instantaneous- %0a> man feels no discomfort, since he does what he is accustomed to do. %0a> %0a> Hence, it seems to such a man, who observes the Mitzvot because of the %0a> acquired nature (habit), that he demands no reward for his actions either in %0a> this world or in the world to come. After all, he truly does not think about any %0a> reward, as his habit, which became his second nature, compels him to perform %0a> these actions. If he feels this way, he is absolutely positive that he acts "for the %0a> Creator's sake." The fact that his habit, his second nature, compels him to %0a> perform the Mitzvot mechanically, escapes his awareness. %0a> %0a> However, since our body is no more than an animal, the mechanical %0a> fulfillment of the Mitzvot by force of habit or for a reward is quite sufficient for %0a> him. There is a difference between those who observe because of upbringing or %0a> habit, and those who do it for a reward: the former do not even care whether %0a> or not the Creator actually exists; they perform purely mechanical actions that %0a> they cannot help performing, for they immediately begin to suffer for lack of %0a> habitual actions. %0a> %0a> Yet, one who observes the Mitzvot because he has faith in reward and %0a> punishment believes in the Creator, His Torah, and His governance, but simply %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 476 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> uses it for his own benefit. By observing the Mitzvot with such an intention %0a> and remaining in it all of his life, he, naturally, does not grow spiritually. And %0a> he who does not grow in our world is called "still" (inanimate), as we divide all %0a> nature into the following levels: still, vegetative, animate, and speaking (human). %0a> Therefore, such people are regarded as spiritually still (Domem de Kedusha), but %0a> they are already "spiritually" still, as opposed to those who observe mechanically, %0a> by force of habit. %0a> %0a> In Kabbalah, the word "body" implies desire. A desire or a body can be %0a> goistic or spiritual (altruistic). The gradual passing of the egoistic body and its %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> : with the altruistic one is called man's "spiritual birth." %0a> %0a> Man's spiritual growth is designated by an increasingly growing intention %0a> to observe the Mitzvot only because such is the Creator's desire. Man observes %0a> it only for His sake, completely selflessly, as if no reward of any kind will ever %0a> be given to him in return, not even in the form of his own self-content. It is %0a> as though the Creator does not know who fulfills His desire, as though man %0a> himself is uncertain of whether or not he observes the Mitzvot. Yet, he does it %0a> anyway, for such is the Creator's will. %0a> %0a> So then, the notion of "body" in Kabbalah alludes to man's corrected %0a> ;sires, whereas uncorrected desires, without a screen, cannot be used, %0a> igh they are not considered body parts, existing beyond the body, %0a> considered foreign forces or desires— Klipot (shells). %0a> %0a> only existing creation besides the Creator is the egoistic will tc %0a> lim that was created by Him. This desire can be either egoistic (corrupted) or %0a> altruistic (corrected), spiritually pure or impure. All the spiritual forces: angels, %0a> Klipot, etc., constitute our uncorrected or corrected desires (the will to bestow %0a> delight upon the Creator). Nothing else exists in the universe! %0a> %0a> There are twelve parts in the spiritual body that perform spiritual actions: %0a> two arms and two legs, each consisting of three parts, in all 4 x 3 = 12. These %0a> parts of our spiritual body (our desires that were corrected by the screen) observe %0a> the positive Mitzvot. %0a> %0a> Just like the body of a spiritual object (Partzuf), man's body is his altruistic %0a> desires, in which he can receive the Creator's Light according to his intentions %0a> (screen). Man's desires are determined by his intentions. %0a> %0a> All the work with the intention "for the Creator's sake" is performed by %0a> the external body parts: the twelve parts of arms and legs, and by the twelve %0a> internal body parts: brain, heart, liver, mouth, tongue, five parts of the lungs, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 477 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> and two kidneys. These inner corrections of the body are meant for reception of %0a> the Supernal spirit, Light, inside the body, and represent man's most important %0a> work with regard to the Creator. %0a> %0a> These inner actions are called Mitzvot. They depend on speech, such as a %0a> prayer— supplications, blessings, and praises. And he who comes to know this %0a> work is happy in all things. Man does not realize that his prayer permeates all %0a> the Heavens, rising up to the very pinnacle of the universe and reaching the %0a> Creator Himself. %0a> %0a> As was repeatedly mentioned, not a single word in the Torah speaks of our %0a> world, especially not of our body. All the words in the Torah are the Creator's %0a> sacred names— the various sensations of the Creator felt by those who attain %0a> Him. As we have explained, the attainment and sensation of the Creator is %0a> impossible without a screen, an altruistic intention, meaning that all that man %0a> desires is to please his Creator. Only the sensations in the heart (the essence of %0a> man) can perform this work, and never the physiological organs of our animate %0a> body, which is no different from that of an animal. %0a> %0a> When the morning Light begins to shine, separating Light from darkness, %0a> a call pierces through all the Heavens: prepare for the opening of entrances and %0a> chambers, and each go to your position. For the ones that serve at night are not the %0a> ones that serve in the daytime. And when the night comes, the daytime servants %0a> are once more replaced by the nighttime ones. %0a> %0a> When the morning Light begins to shine— when man begins to realize that %0a> his egoistic desires are death and darkness, whereas altruism and spirituality are %0a> life and Light, the Light within man thereby separates from darkness, and he %0a> begins to analyze and realize his states, to feel spiritual ascents and descents— he %0a> feels his proximity to the Creator as Light, while remoteness from Him and %0a> descents into his egoistic desires feel like darkness. %0a> %0a> However, one can feel it only if he feels the Creator (even if only a little, %0a> even if indistinctly). To start feeling the shame of receiving from the Creator and %0a> e insignificance of one's nature (the sensation of darkness), one must first feel %0a> e Creator. Only His Light contains all that man needs: strength for correction, %0a> ■.sires, life. Hence, the main thing to which man must aspire is the sensation of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The forces that serve in the daytime are called the "rulers, the government of %0a> the day," and the forces that serve at night are called the "rulers, the government %0a> of the night." As soon as the morning call is heard, they all take their positions, %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 478 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut and Israel descend and enter the Beit-Knesset (the House of Assembly— %0a> a place, where all of man's wishes are collected; hence, it is called the house of %0a> prayer) to exalt the Creator and begin their singing and blessings. %0a> %0a> It is written: "We shall praise Your mercy in the morning and Your faith at %0a> night." Feeling the Creator's Light descending upon him, man perceives it as %0a> morning that comes after the darkness, and upon feeling such a state, he praises %0a> the Creator in his heart. All alien thoughts retreat before the influence of the %0a> Creator's Light, and all impure desires become restrained. %0a> %0a> After man has corrected himself in the positive Mitzvot (in the first part, %0a> in the corrections of Tzitzit and Tefillin), he must unite all of his heart's desires %0a> in inner work (in the second part), and wholeheartedly dedicate himself to the %0a> work of praises, since speech rises upwards. %0a> %0a> It is impossible to offer a brief explanation of the Mitzvot of Tefillin and %0a> Tzitzit, observed only by those who spiritually attained the level of Partzuf ZA. %0a> %0a> These servants, who stood in their places in the air, are appointed to rule %0a> over the four sides of the world. Gazaria soars in the air to govern the East, and %0a> all the others that are appointed are together with him, and await the words of %0a> the prayer that rises on that side from below. And this ruler takes the prayer. %0a> %0a> If the words of a prayer are proper, then all these rulers absorb them and %0a> rise with them to the firmament, where the other rulers stand. Upon absorbing %0a> these words, they proclaim, "Blessed be Israel. Blessed be the lips that utter %0a> these words!" %0a> %0a> The letters that were hanging in the air then fly up and form the holy %0a> name that rules in the air and consists of twelve letters. This is the name by %0a> which Eliyahu flew before rising up to the sky. The letters fly up in the air, %0a> and the ruler, who holds the keys to the air in his hand, rises to Heaven along %0a> with all the other rulers, and pass the letters into the hands of another ruler %0a> for further ascent. %0a> %0a> After Malchut had been separated from ZA, ZA filled himself with only Ohr %0a> Hassadim and became the right line, whereas Malchut formed the left line. These %0a> two lines are in conflict with one another, just as the right and the left lines of %0a> Bina oppose one another. This continues until ZA ascends to Bina as the middle %0a> line, balances the right and the left lines, and makes peace between them by %0a> uniting them in a single, middle line. %0a> %0a> Similarly, ZA and Malchut, the two opposite lines, need a middle line to %0a> balance them, to bring them balance and peace, and to unite them.

Also, the screen that they raise is called the %0a> Masach (screen) de (of) Hirik— the middle line— causing the left and the right lines %0a> to unite, and Malchut to unite with ZA. %0a> %0a> Thus, a prayer becomes a request, MAN, and the middle line that leads to %0a> peace and unity between ZA and Malchut. Just like Yesod Above (the middle line) %0a> unites the Creator with the Shechina-Malchut by gathering all the created souls, %0a> man's prayer creates the middle line and unites all by its ascent— bringing peace %0a> and unity between the Creator and the Shechina (His creatures), the unity of %0a> souls with their Creator. %0a> %0a> Hence, just like the Sefira Yesod Above, man, too, is called Shalom (peace). %0a> Moreover, the world below precedes and determines the world Above, for the %0a> awakening from below (requests of the lower ones) precedes and evokes the %0a> awakening from Above. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> - except 1 %0a> %0a> imagine derives only from these two spiritual forces.

After all, it is well known that no degree %0a> can rise above itself, let alone make such an incredible leap from the lowest %0a> degree of the spiritual ladder (our world) to the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> To understand that, we must first thoroughly understand the meaning of %0a> Malchut's ascent to Bina. As a result of this ascent, each degree splits into two %0a> parts: Keter and Hochma of each degree remain within it, while Bina, ZA, and %0a> Malchut fall to a lower degree. This occurs because Malchut ascended to Bina and %0a> thereby created in Bina a new Sof (end) of the degree. This is because Malchut %0a> exists under the prohibition of the first restriction, and hence cannot receive the %0a> Light. Due to the second restriction, Bina, ZA, and Malchut are located below %0a> the new Sof of the degree. Thus, being below Malchut that ascended to Bina, they %0a> are defined as a lower degree. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina =Awzen %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA = Hotem ) Together they are called AHP (Awzen-Hotem-Peh) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut = Peh %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Together they are called GE (Galgalta-Eynaim) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa = Ascended Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 481 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Afterward, through the MAN raised by the lower ones, the Light AB-SAG %0a> descends and gives strength to Malchut, which stands in Bina, to descend to her %0a> own place: Malchut descends from Bina to her own place, thereby returning all %0a> the Sefirot to their places and uniting them all into one degree, consisting of %0a> ten whole Sefirot. Consequently, Bina and ZON, which were below each degree, %0a> return to their degree, to their previous level. Thus, each degree restores itself %0a> back to ten Sefirot. %0a> %0a> However, although Malchut, who stood in Bina as the new Sof (end) of the %0a> degree, returns from Bina to her own place at the end of every ten Sefirot, this %0a> new Sof that she created in Bina does not entirely vanish from Bina. As a result, %0a> Bina and ZON do not descend to their place. Instead, they must rise above the %0a> new Sof and there create the left line with regard to Keter and Hochma, which %0a> never fell from their degree and constitute the right line. %0a> %0a> This is why the new Sof remains in its place in all the degrees even after %0a> Malchut 's descent from Bina. And this Sof is called the "firmament," while Bina %0a> and ZON, which fell from their degree, but now have returned to it, are called %0a> "air." For each lower degree is defined as VAK (called Avir— air) with regard to %0a> the Upper One. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Since Bina and ZON fell from their degree, they became as VAK (air) with %0a> regard to it, as the entire lower degree with regard to the Upper. And after %0a> the descent of Malchut from Bina, the air (Bina and ZON) that was under the %0a> firmament rises above it and becomes the left line. %0a> %0a> When Bina and ZON ascend above the firmament, they take with them %0a> the lower degree, where they existed when they were below, and elevate it along %0a> with them above the firmament. It is so because unlike our world, there are no %0a> ascents and descents in the spiritual; a descent constitutes the deterioration of %0a> one's properties from one spiritual level to a lower one. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Parsa (Firmament) - %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bina %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> = Awzen %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP (Air) %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 482 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hence, being equivalent in properties with the lower degree, when Bina and %0a> ZON ascend together, they take the entire lower degree along with them. For %0a> after being together once, and having become similar, they receive help, ascend, %0a> and never part again. %0a> %0a> Ultimately, Malchut's ascent to Bina forms an entrance, an opening, a gate %0a> for the lower degree, through which it can ascend to the Upper One. Hence, %0a> when Malchut descends from Bina, thus allowing the lower part, AHP de Bina, to %0a> ascend, the lower degree can rise along with the ascending AHP de Bina. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> GEof the Upper One %0a> %0a> Firmament %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> B %0a> %0a> The entire %0a> level ZA %0a> %0a> ascends %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of the Upper One (Air) %0a> & GE of the Lower One %0a> %0a> Land or Earth of the Upper One %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA / AHP of the Lower One %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Thus, as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina and her subsequent descent due %0a> to the influence of Ohr AB-SAG, three parts were formed in each degree: %0a> %0a> - Air, Bina and ZON that fell down; %0a> %0a> - The firmaments, the new ends of degrees that appeared through %0a> Malchut's ascent to Bina. These never disappear, even if Malchut %0a> returns to her place; %0a> %0a> - The entrances for the lower degrees that were formed through %0a> Malchut's ascent to Bina, when the lower degree ascends along with %0a> her. Without it, the lower degree can never reach the Upper One, for %0a> no degree can ascend above itself. %0a> %0a> This process is described in the Chassidic tales as the mission of a righteous %0a> one (the Upper Degree) in our world: to descend to the most vile and corrupt %0a> people (the lower degree). In other words, while essentially remaining itself, %0a> the Upper Degree should corrupt its properties so as to equalize with the lower %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 483 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> :gree. Thus, it shows to the lower ones that in its desires, thoughts, and actions, %0a> is the same as them. %0a> %0a> Then, when he completely unites with them, and they fully trust him, %0a> e becomes "one of them" (designating the union of AHP of the Upper %0a> ith GE of the lower one), he gradually, inconspicuously or openly, begins to %0a> correct them— by his own example, he propagates his thoughts to them. These %0a> thoughts cannot be perceived from an outsider, but only from "one of their %0a> hat is, the Upper One receives additional Light (strength) in its GE %0a> le to raise its own AHP, correct its desires of reception, start wo %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> And since there is no distinction between the desires of AHP of the Upper %0a> One and GE of the lower one, into which AHP of the Upper One fell, they both %0a> rise together. This way, the Upper One elevates, i.e., improves, corrects a certain %0a> part of the lower one's properties (GE), and elevates them to its true level. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the most important thing in our state is to come to feel AHP of %0a> the Upper Degree, located at the very center of our heart, and to become equal %0a> with it in our properties so as to afterwards rise together with it. %0a> %0a> This process is described in the book Attaining the Worlds Beyond, which %0a> provides a more personal perspective of this spiritual process: %0a> %0a> Inside the internal sensations of the Kabbalist exists a part of the Higher %0a> evel, of the future state (AHP). One who perceives a Higher Spiritual Level ; %0a> 1 unattractive vacuum, rather than a state full of Light, does not receive %0a> ler level. %0a> %0a> en though the Higher Level is full of Light, the lower level perceives %0a> ;r only to the degree that the lower qualities permit one to do so. Since the %0a> present qualities are not sufficient to receive the Higher Light, the individual %0a> does not perceive it. %0a> %0a> We can perceive the Upper Level because all the spiritual steps are arranged %0a> sequentially from lowest to highest. Moreover, the subsequent states overlap %0a> th one another; the lower half of the Higher state is situated within the Upper %0a> er state (AHP of Upper falls into GE of lower). %0a> %0a> , the lowest part of our Upper State is always present within us, %0a> usually not felt by us. The Upper State above us is referred to as "the Creator" %0a> functions as the Creator for us. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It gives birth to us and it gives us life and guidance. Since we do not ha %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 484 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> iin over al %0a> freely. %0a> %0a> can see only One Truth, %0a> rates in everything and in everyone. %0a> %0a> Since the Will of the Creator is to grant each human being a free will, then %0a> the concealment of the Creator from His creations is necessary. Only if He is %0a> hidden can we argue that we can aspire of our free will to attach ourselves to the %0a> Creator— to act for His sake, without any trace of self-interest. %0a> %0a> le entire process of self-correction is possible only when the Crea %0a> lied from us. As soon as He reveals Himself to us we immediately 1 %0a> servants and fall into the control of His thought, grandeur and pc %0a> %0a> that point, it is impossible to determine what our true thoi %0a> rder to allow us to act freely, the Creator has to conceal Hir %0a> %0a> On the other hand, to give us a chance to break free from the blind slave %0a> of egoism, the Creator must reveal Himself. This is so because a human being %0a> obeys only two forces in this world: the force of egoism— the body— and the force %0a> of the Creator— altruism. %0a> %0a> It follows, then, that alternating the two states is necessary. These states are %0a> the concealment of the Creator from us when we perceive only ourselves and %0a> the egoistic forces governing us, and the revelation of the Creator when %0a> power of the spiritual forces. %0a> %0a> l order for one who is still under the influence of egoism to percei %0a> Upper Object (the Creator), the Creator must equalize some of His %0a> qualities with those of the lower being— the person seeking a connection with %0a> the Creator. %0a> %0a> He will endow some of His altruistic qualities with egoistic attributes, and %0a> can then come into balance with the person seeking connection with Him. %0a> %0a> The Upper Part elevates the Malchut-Midat HaDin to the level of His Galgalta %0a> ve Eynaim. As a result, His AHP acquires egoistic qualities. In this manner, His %0a> AHP "descends" to the lower part (the spiritual level of the seeker) and comes %0a> into a state of equivalence with the qualities of the lower part. %0a> %0a> Initially the lower part was not able to perceive the Upper Spiritual State. %0a> However, because the Creator hid His highest altruistic qualities behind egoistic %0a> ones, He was able to descend to the level of the person so that the person was %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the ego: %0a> the pow %0a> %0a> In ( %0a> %0a> closest %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ves and %0a> we feel %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 485 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> that %0a> a the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> re or %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> se we perceive higher qualities as being egoistic, we are unable to truly %0a> essence. It appears that there is nothing positive in the spiritual tha %0a> asure, inspiration, confidence, or tranquility. %0a> %0a> precisely at this point that we have an opportunity to exercise %0a> llpower. We may, instead, declare that the absence of pleasure and taste in %0a> spiritual and in Kabbalah is because of the Creator's deliberate concealment for %0a> our own sake. Because we do not yet possess the necessary spiritual qualities, it %0a> is therefore impossible for us to perceive the Upper spiritual pleasures; rather, %0a> our earthly desires are governed by egoism. %0a> %0a> tied for beginners to understand that they are given depression %0a> %0a> m. %0a> %0a> relief to the Creator, they may study, or %0a> t such people do not experience pleasure %0a> aspirations is directed from Above. %0a> %0a> This gives them the free will to conclude that their lack of pleasure comes %0a> from a lack of appropriate altruistic qualities in themselves. Hence, the Upper %0a> One must hide His true qualities from them. %0a> %0a> Therefore, we must remember that the first stage of perceiving the spiritual %0a> is the feeling of spiritual deprivation. If the lower part is capable of realizing that %0a> the Upper One is concealing Himself because of their incongruity of qualities, %0a> and if that lower part asks for help to correct its own egoism by raising a p %0a> (MAN), then the Upper Part partially reveals Himself (lifts His AHP) and display: %0a> His true qualities, which prior to this moment, were disguised beneath egi %0a> %0a> As a result, spiritual pleasure also becomes apparent. Thus, the lower part %0a> begins to experience the grandeur and the spiritual pleasure felt by the Higher %0a> Being, Who possesses spiritual altruistic qualities. %0a> %0a> Because the Upper Part elevated His altruistic qualities in the eyes of the %0a> individual, He thus elevated the individual to the middle of His State (He lifted %0a> GE of the lower together with His own AHP). %0a> %0a> This spiritual state is known as a person's "lesser spiritual level" (Katnut). %0a> e Upper Part, in a way, elevates the lower part to His own spiritual level by %0a> ing both His grandeur and the grandeur of altruistic qualities. By seeing %0a> magnificence of the spiritual and comparing it to the material, we may %0a> ally rise above our world. %0a> %0a> en we perceive the spiritual, regardless of our will, our egoistic qualities %0a> ged into altruistic ones, that is, into the qualities of the Creator.

At the same time, the %0a> part grasps the highest knowledge of the purpose of creation and %0a> Upper's dominion. %0a> %0a> It becomes clear to the lower part that there is no other way to conduct %0a> oneself than in the way prescribed by Kabbalah. Thus, the lower part's reason %0a> now requires proper action. As a result of this clear awareness of the Creator, %0a> one must deal with the contradiction between faith and knowledge, between %0a> right and the left lines. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Now, having acquired altruistic qualities (Katnut), the lower part prefers to %0a> )roceed only by means of faith in the strength of the Creator. This serves as %0a> ication of the seeker's sincere desire to come closer to the Cres %0a> %0a> ;r, the Creator's revelation of His grandeur (Gadlut) nov %0a> advancing by faith. Consequently, the individual must willing %0a> se with the acquired knowledge. %0a> %0a> len one pleads to proceed blindly, relying only on one's faith %0a> magnificence of the Creator, rather than by realizing His power and grandeur, %0a> and only by using reason in proportion to one's faith, the Creator is compelled %0a> to limit His disclosure. When such an action compels the Creator to diminish %0a> His disclosure of His general dominion, His omnipotence, and His Light (Ohr %0a> Hochma), this is called "the screen of Hirik." %0a> %0a> Through this screen, we are able to diminish the revelation of the Upper %0a> reason (the left line) to the point at which this revelation can be balanced with %0a> the right line.

Thus, man ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a> %0a> "Piercing through the air" means that the air boundary, consisting of Bina %0a> and ZON of the Upper Degree, created as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, is %0a> pierced by Malchut's descent from Bina to her place, for then the air rises above %0a> the firmament and reaches GAR (GE) of the degree. %0a> %0a> Thus occurs the piercing of the firmaments. For the firmaments constitute %0a> the borders of new ends, which appeared because the air (Bina and ZON) was %0a> pushed off from its own degree to a lower one, and was not allowed to return %0a> to its degree. Hence, the firmament is pierced from Malchut's descent, and no %0a> longer prevents Bina and ZON from ascending and joining that degree. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> GE of the Upper one %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Firmament %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> B %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> K %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of Upper one (Air) + GE of Lower one %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> H %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> B %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP of of the Lower one %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> M %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 490 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 1. Malchut ascended to Bina = firmament. %0a> %0a> 2. Malchut descends back. This creates a passage for AHP to its GE. Thus, %0a> the entrances for the lower degree are opened: due to Malchut's descent to her %0a> place and the piercing through the firmaments, Bina and ZON ascend to a %0a> Higher Degree above the firmament together with the lower degree that they %0a> were with during their descent. %0a> %0a> In other words, the Upper One deliberately opened up the entrances to %0a> enable the lower degree to ascend to a Higher Degree, and not for Bina and %0a> ZON (AHP of the Upper One), who simply return to their place. %0a> %0a> The Light that lowers Malchut from Bina to her own place at the end of the %0a> ten Sefirot stems from Partzufim AB-SAG. These are the Partzufim Hochma and %0a> Bina of the world of AK. Although the second restriction— Malchut's ascent to %0a> Bina— occurred in Partzuf Bina of the world of AK, the Partzufim Bina (SAG) and %0a> Hochma (AB) of the world of AK were unaffected by it, and Malchut remains in %0a> her place at the end of the ten Sefirot. %0a> %0a> Only the Creator Himself, meaning the properties of the Light, can correct %0a> and transform man's egoistic properties to altruistic. Indeed, man is simply %0a> unable to pull himself out of his current state "by his own hair," as from birth %0a> he has absolutely no spiritual strength (desires). Hence, only the Upper Light %0a> correct him. And it can only be Ohr Hochma, for this is the Light tl %0a> itor emanates. Ohr Hochma, unrestricted by Tzimtzum Bet, is locatec %0a> %0a> Therefore, when one raises his MAN (prayer), it reaches the Highest %0a> Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, which turn to SAG-Bina-Ima (mother), who %0a> in turn appeals to AB-Hochma-Aba (father), receives Ohr Hochma from him and %0a> passes it to her children— the souls of the righteous, those who wish to become %0a> righteous and to ascend spiritually. %0a> %0a> Hence, when HochmaAB unites with Bina-SAG in the world of AK, this %0a> Light (Ohr AB-SAG) descends from Partzuf Bina de AK to Partzuf Bina de Atzilut, %0a> called EKYEH = Ale£>h-He;y-Yo%3ciHe;y. Partzuf Bina de Atzilut sends the Light to all %0a> the degrees of the worlds of BYA. Upon attaining a particular Partzuf, this Light %0a> lowers the Malchut of each degree (that ascended to Bina) from the degree of %0a> Bina to her previous place. %0a> %0a> Starting with AVI, all the Partzufim are in the state of Katnut: AHP of the %0a> Upper Partzuf is inside GE of the lower one.

Malchut receives from them, and all %0a> three names govern in her air together. %0a> %0a> The triple name, EKYEH, comprises twelve letters. This twelve-letter name %0a> rules in the air by lowering Malchut from Bina to her previous place, returning %0a> Bina and ZON (called "air"), who fell to a lower degree, back to the degree above %0a> the firmament. For Malchut's ascent to Bina created an entrance, to enable the %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> These Partzufim %0a> channel the Light of %0a> AB-SAG from %0a> SAG of AK %0a> %0a> down to AVI de Atzilut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 492 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> lower one rise to the Upper Degree as soon as it opens, i.e., during Malchut's %0a> return to her place. %0a> %0a> Hence, when the prophet Eliyahu (a particular spiritual degree) wished to %0a> soar to the sky, Malchut of each degree ascended to Bina of the corresponding %0a> degree, while Bina and ZON of this degree fell to the lower degree, and a %0a> firmament was formed between them. It turned out that each degree doubled: %0a> now it contained its own degree, as well as Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, %0a> who fell and clothed the lower degree. %0a> %0a> This occurred at each degree of the worlds of ABYA, down to the lowest %0a> one: Bina and ZON of the Sefira Malchut of the world of Assiya fell and emerged %0a> in our world below Malchut. Malchut de Assiya ends at its firmament, which is a %0a> new end, in Bina.

The Sefira Netzah de %0a> Assiya also doubled, and so on up to Bina de Atzilut. This is why the prophet %0a> Eliyahu rose up and united with Bina and ZON, who fell from Malchut de Assiya %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 493 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> to this world.

And as before, %0a> Bina and ZON ascended to their degree above the firmament of Malchut.

And since Eliyahu had already merged with this air, he (man's soul, his %0a> desire) too ascended above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, due to his concord %0a> with them. %0a> %0a> And because he rose above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, he met with %0a> the air (AHP) of Hod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Hod de Assiya that fell down %0a> there. Subsequently, he merged in his desires with this air and clothed it, for %0a> they were previously at the same place (spiritually similar to one another). %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 494 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> As soon as man merges in his properties with AHP of the Upper One, the %0a> influence of the twelve-letter name (the descent of the Light of AB-SAG from %0a> Above) brings Malchut back (gives strength to the screen) to the end of the ten %0a> individual Sefirot of Hod de Assiya. And the air, its Bina and ZON, returned to %0a> their place above the firmament of Hod de Assiya. They took Eliyahu (man's soul, %0a> his desires) with them, for he had merged with them, and they elevated him to %0a> the firmament of Hod de Assiya in view of his similarity with them. %0a> %0a> And when he was already in the firmament of Hod de Assiya, he met with %0a> the air (AHP) of Netzah de Assiya and merged with it in his properties. When the %0a> influence of the twelve-letter name (the Light of correction, AB-SAG, that was sent %0a> by the Creator) brought Malchut back to her place (Malchut descended from Bina %0a> to Malchut of this Sefira, because she received strength from the Light to resist %0a> the egoistic desires of AHP and make them altruistic), the air of Netzah ascended %0a> above the firmament, and being merged with Eliyahu (man's soul), took him with %0a> it. Being already in the firmament of Net^ah, he met with the air of Tifferet and so %0a> on, until he ascended with this air above the firmament of Tifferet de Assiya. %0a> %0a> In the same way, the air (AHP) of each degree rose higher, up to the Highest %0a> Degree of the world of Assiya. From there, it rose to Malchut de Yetzira, and from %0a> there— one step at a time— along all the degrees of the world of Yet^zra and the %0a> world of Beria, up to the Heavens (ZA) of the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> It is therefore said about the prophet Eliyahu that the Creator's spirit %0a> (the Light AB-SAG) elevated him (merged with AHP of the Upper One) to the %0a> Heavens: spirit means Ruach, Sefirot Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, called %0a> "air," that fell down to the lower degree. And this air (spirit) elevates one from %0a> a lower degree to a Higher One through all the individual degrees, from the %0a> lowest degree (So/ de Assiya) up to the world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> An Upper Degree is regarded as the Creator of the lower degree: it creates %0a> it, vitalizes it with Light, and governs it. At each degree, man considers the next %0a> Highest spiritual degree with regard to him as the Creator. As Rabbi Zushe said: %0a> "Every day I have a new Creator." In other words, as man ascends to a Higher %0a> Degree (which he calls "day" or "Light"), he thereby reveals a new property of %0a> the Creator in this Higher Degree. %0a> %0a> The air of each of the four sides of the world (in Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet- %0a> Malchui) has its own rulers, who hold the keys to the activation of the twelve- %0a> letter name so as to lower Malchut from Bina to her own place. The ascending %0a> order of these four kinds of air is as follows: West-Malchut, East-Ti//eret (including %0a> NHY), North-Gei/ura, and South-Hesed. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 495 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Hesed %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> - SOUTH %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Gevura %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> NORTH %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> - EAST %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut - WEST %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> It is not the rulers that raise a prayer (the desire that man feels in the very %0a> depths of his heart) from air to air, and then from firmament to firmament. %0a> The air raises a prayer from the firmament, each air to its firmament: first, the %0a> prayer ascends to the air of the Sefira Malchut de Assiya, i.e., to Bina and ZON %0a> (AHP) that fell from Malchut de Assiya down to our world. They resemble the %0a> prayer itself, for this air (AHP) is similar to a prayer (the Upper One lowered %0a> itself deliberately to equalize its properties with the lower one); hence, they %0a> merge as one degree. %0a> %0a> Then the one that rules there, Zvuliel (Zebuliel), activates the twelve-letter %0a> name, which lowers Malchut from Bina de Assiya to her place. This causes the %0a> air to return to its degree and rise above the firmament of the world of Assiya. %0a> And since the air became similar to the degree of the actual prayer, it also takes %0a> the prayer along with it, raising it above the firmament of the Sefira Malchut de %0a> Assiya. This is similar to the ascent of Prophet Eliyahu. %0a> %0a> And since the prayer ascended to the firmament of the world of Assiya, it %0a> meets the air of Yesod de Assiya that fell there, as in the case of Eliyahu. It also %0a> encounters the ruler of the air of the East, Gazaria (Gazardiel), because East %0a> designates the Sefira Tifferet (ZA is often called Tifferet, as the properties of this %0a> Sefira dominate and determine all the properties of ZA), which includes the %0a> Sefira Yesod, for Tifferet includes Sefirot NHY. %0a> %0a> This ruler activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina %0a> de Yesod to her place, which causes the air of Yesod to ascend to its degree, %0a> the firmament of Yesod. By merging with the prayer into one degree via %0a> equivalence of form, he takes it with him and raises it above the firmament %0a> of Yesod. Then, a similar action occurs in the air and firmament of Sefirot %0a> Netzah, Hod, and Tifferet. %0a> %0a> Since the prayer ascended to the firmament of Tifferet, it encounters the %0a> Northern air, i.e., Bina and ZON of Gevura de Assiya that fell there. There it %0a> unites with this air into one degree. Then the ruler of the North, Petachia %0a> (Petahyah), activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina to her %0a> place. Consequently, the air returns, ascends to the firmament of Gevura and %0a> takes with it the prayer, which merged with it into one degree during its fall. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 496 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Since the prayer has already reached the firmament of Gevura, it meets with %0a> the Southern air, Bina and ZON of Hesed de Assiya that fell there, and merges %0a> with this air. Then the ruler of the Southern air, named Pisgania (Pesagniyah), %0a> Hesed de Assiya, activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina of %0a> Hesed de Assiya to her place. The Southern air returns and ascends to its degree %0a> in the sixth firmament, Hesed de Assiya, called "south." %0a> %0a> Since the prayer has reached the sixth firmament, it encounters the air that %0a> fell from the seventh firmament, which is Bina that includes GAR, and the prayer %0a> merges with this air into one degree. When the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut %0a> from Bina (the seventh firmament) to her place, the air returns to its degree (the %0a> seventh firmament) and takes the prayer with it, as they merge during its fall. %0a> %0a> Since the prayer has reached the seventh firmament, it encounters the air %0a> that fell from Malchut de Yetzira, and merges with it. Next, the general ruler, %0a> Sandalphon, who governs the entire world of Assiya, takes it and activates the %0a> twelve-letter name, which lowers Malchut from Malchut de Yetzira to her place. %0a> And the air ascends and returns to its degree, the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira, %0a> takes the prayer with it, and elevates it to the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira. %0a> %0a> In exactly the same way, the prayer ascends through all seven Heichalot %0a> (halls) of the worlds Yetzira and Beria up to the world of Atzilut. This clarifies %0a> the question posed in the beginning: how can a prayer ascend from the very %0a> lowest degree of the world of Assiya to the world of Atzilut, for no degree can %0a> ascend above itself? From the aforesaid, it follows that since the prayer merges %0a> with the first air that fell from Malchut de Assiya to our world, it is exactly this %0a> air that elevated them to the firmament of Malchut, whereas the air of Yesod %0a> de Assiya was elevated to the firmament of Yesod, and so forth. In other words, %0a> the air with which the prayer merges and ascends elevates it to Malchut of the %0a> world of Atzilut. %0a> %0a> He who falls from Malchut de Assiya to our world descends from the spiritual %0a> degree called Malchut de Assiya to the spiritual degree called our world. Of course, %0a> this in no way refers to the physical existence in our world. AHP of the Upper %0a> Degree are considered fallen when one feels in his heart (in the center of all of %0a> his desires) the desire to attain the spiritual, merge with it, and annul his egoistic %0a> properties because they harm and impede his advancement. %0a> %0a> One should not think that the fall of Bina and ZON to our world from the %0a> world of Assiya can be experienced by anyone. And only he who felt this way %0a> and was then able to make a sufficient amount of quantitative and qualitative %0a> efforts, merits being elevated above our world by AHP of the Upper One. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 497 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> On the Southern side (Hesed), there is he who governs the air of that side, %0a> and his assistants. His name is Pisgania, and he holds the keys to the air of %0a> this side. All those who suffer pray to their Creator from the depths of their %0a> broken hearts (the very sensation of suffering constitutes a prayer, and requires %0a> no words). If their speech (desires) is worthy, it ascends to the air of this side, %0a> and the ruler accepts and kisses it ("embrace," "kiss," and Zivug are forms of %0a> spiritual union of Partzufim), and then declares: "The Creator will be merciful %0a> and will spare you in His mercy." %0a> %0a> All of the holy rulers (Ohr Hochma is called holy) and their assistants of that %0a> side rise together with him. The letters of the Creator's holy name, of the twelve- %0a> letter name EKYEH soar: four letters Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey on each side, which %0a> rule the corresponding sides of air. They ascend on this side of the air to the %0a> Southern firmament, Hesed (the sixth firmament), to the ruler of the firmament %0a> of the Southern side, named Anafiel. %0a> %0a> On the Northern side (Gevura) there is Petachia, who governs the air with %0a> his assistants. If he who prays for his enemies and haters, i.e., for those who %0a> make him suffer is righteous, then as the speech of his prayer rises to the air %0a> of that side, the ruler accepts his heart's speech and kisses it (unites it with his %0a> properties so as to raise it higher). %0a> %0a> The air that comes from the North stirs and calls upon all the firmaments, %0a> and they all take this speech, raise it to the Northern, fifth firmament, kiss %0a> it and say: "The Lord will cast your enemies down and take them away from %0a> your face." This occurs in the following order: after the governor of the air had %0a> accepted the prayer and kissed it, which means that it merged with the degree %0a> of the air and the ruler, the air stirs on the Northern side (the new end that %0a> Malchut made as she ascended to Bina, called Techum— space, from the word %0a> Tohu— chaos), and the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut from Bina of Gevura de %0a> Assiya back to her place. %0a> %0a> The air that fell into the restrictions (Dinim) of this space is aroused by %0a> the desire to rise to the firmament of Gevura. Also, all the degrees that merged %0a> with it during its fall rise along with it to the firmament of Gevura due to their %0a> similarity to it. Similarly, the prayer that was merged with it during its fall ascends %0a> along with it to the fifth firmament. %0a> %0a> The order of the ascent (offering up of a prayer) starts from here: it ascends %0a> and pierces through the air (AHP), which fell from Malchut de Assiya to our %0a> world, and ascends with it to the first firmament, the firmament of Malchut de %0a> Assiya. The prayer ascends and approaches the ruler (in its properties), who was %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 498 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> appointed to control the Western side, Malchut. There are nine entrances where %0a> the assistants to the ruler, Zvuliel stand. %0a> %0a> The ten Sefirot of Malchut herself have nine (not ten) entrances, for a %0a> restriction to receive the Light is imposed on Malchut of the Sefira Malchut, and %0a> it is connected to Yesod de Malchut. Hence, Yesod and Malchut of Malchut share %0a> the same entrance. %0a> %0a> However, a question arises: "Why do all the parts of the air have one ruler for %0a> the air and a separate ruler for the firmament? For example, on the Eastern side %0a> Gazaria controls the Eastern air and Shimshiel controls the Eastern firmament %0a> (Tifferet, the fourth firmament). Similarly, Pisgania controls the Southern air on %0a> the Southern side, and Anafiel controls the Southern firmament. And on the %0a> Northern side, the ruler Petachia governs the Northern air, and Gadriel is in %0a> charge of the Northern firmament. So why does only Malchut have one general %0a> ruler, called Zvuliel, who governs both the air and the firmament?" %0a> %0a> The reason is that due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, Bina and ZON of each %0a> degree fall to a lower degree, the degree of air. However, only the lower part of %0a> Bina (ZAT or VAK de Bina) falls, whereas Keter, Hochma, and the Upper half of %0a> Bina (GAR de Bina) remain at the same degree. Only the lower half of Bina, ZAT %0a> de Bina (ZA and Malchut) fell from this degree and became air. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Keter %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> GE %0a> %0a> %0a> Hochma %0a> %0a> %0a> q- GAR of Bina %0a> Bina ZATofB~ina %0a> %0a> %0a> — Parsa = Malchut — %0a> %0a> %0a> ZA %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> AHP %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Therefore, two separate rulers were needed: one for the Upper Degree %0a> remaining above the firmament, and the other— for the lower half of the degree %0a> that fell and turned into air. The degree (ten Sefirot) of Malchut, from whom %0a> all nine lower Sefirot fell to the lower degree during Malchut's ascent to Bina, %0a> retained only one Sefira Keter de Malchut, which remained as a point below %0a> Yesod de ZA. %0a> %0a> Nevertheless, even this point refers more to the Sefira Yesod, which is superior %0a> to Malchut, because its properties are more similar to Yesod. And since all of %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 499 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Malchut refers to the properties of air (except for her individual Keter), she has %0a> only one ruler. %0a> %0a> The ruler wishes to act in the firmament in the daylight, but does not %0a> receive permission until the moon rises, i.e., until nightfall, when all the rulers %0a> and forces emerge. And when the day breaks (the Upper Light starts shining), %0a> they all ascend (the spiritual properties become corrected and improve under %0a> the Light's influence) to the Highest of the nine entrances, the point of Keter de %0a> Malchut, which remained at its degree above the firmament (Parsa). %0a> %0a> And when the prayer ascends, it enters through this Upper entrance, and all %0a> the rulers with their assistants emerge from it, led by their Supreme ruler, Zvuliel, %0a> the only ruler of the air of this Upper entrance, who is above the firmament of %0a> Malchut de Assiya. They all emerge, kiss the prayer, and accompany it up the %0a> second firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a> %0a> Malchut constitutes the left line— Hochma without Hassadim. Therefore, when %0a> she dominates, the Light does not shine and darkness prevails. Hochma cannot %0a> shine without Hassadim, which means that when Malchut rules, it is nighttime %0a> (not daylight). Indeed, all nine of her lower Sefirot, from which all the rulers (of %0a> man) and forces (man's desires) of the left side originate, rule at night. %0a> %0a> This is why it is said that Malchut descends from Bina to her place, although %0a> her nine lower Sefirot remained untouched by the impure force, for Malchut %0a> descended from the firmament, which transformed her into air. Even so, they %0a> (nine Sefirot) have no power in her place, and must rise above the firmament to the %0a> Upper entrance, Keter de Malchut. There they enter the right side (Hassadim), and %0a> the prayer ascends with them because of their similarity (in desires, properties), %0a> achieved while they were below the firmament (in the state called "our world"). %0a> %0a> And since the prayer (MAN) rose above the firmament of Malchut (to GE %0a> of the Upper One), it encounters the air (AHP of the still Higher One) that fell %0a> there from the second firmament. After the descent of Malchut from Bina of %0a> Yesod de Assiya to her place, this air ascends to the firmament of Yesod, and takes %0a> with it all the rulers, their assistants, and the prayer, which were merged with it %0a> during its fall, and elevates all of them to the firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a> %0a> And when the prayer ascends to this firmament (Yesod), the twelve gates %0a> of this firmament open up. A special ruler, Ana'el (Anahel), who is in charge %0a> of many forces, stands at the twelfth entrance, and when the prayer ascends, %0a> proclaims to all the entrances: "Open the gates." And all the entrances open up, %0a> and the prayer enters through them. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 500 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> This happens because Tifferet has twelve borders of the diagonal, defined %0a> by the Sefirot H-G-T-M, each of which contains three lines of HGT, twelve in %0a> all. And all that exists in Tifferet is also present in Yesod, but there these twelve %0a> borders are called "twelve gates," through which the prayer enters. %0a> %0a> And then awakens a very old ruler, who stands at the Southern side. His %0a> name is Azriel-Saba, sometimes referred to as Machaniel, for he is responsible %0a> for 600,000 groups (camps— Machanot). All the groups have wings and eyes; they %0a> stand and listen to all those who are quietly praying, to the prayers that come %0a> from the depths of the heart and are directed only to the Creator. Only such %0a> prayers are heard by those who have ears. %0a> %0a> There is a special opening in the Sefira Yesod de Hesed (Supernal mercy) that %0a> descends from the right line of Bina. Hence, the ruler of this mercy is called %0a> Azriel-Saba. He is called Saba (grandfather), because Hochma and Bina are called %0a> "old men." And he is appointed to rule over 600,000 groups (camps), because %0a> 600 = 6 x 100, where 6 = HGT NHY Sefirot in Bina. And since each Sefira in Bina %0a> is designated by 100, 6 x 100 = 600. And the thousands stem from Ohr Hochma, %0a> which shines in each of these Sefirot. Hence, 600 x 1,000 = 600,000 groups. %0a> %0a> GAR de Tvuna, the lower part (ZAT) of Bina, are called "ears." Only Ohr %0a> Hassadim shines in them, without Hochma. VAK de Tvuna are called "eyes," and %0a> Ohr Hochma shines in them. %0a> %0a> Malchut and Bina constitute two kinds of air, West and North, which unite %0a> and intermix, and form a diagonal, a combination of judgment and mercy that %0a> mitigates strictness and judgment. Hence, they hear good words from one who %0a> merits it, i.e., they accept one's prayer to the extent of the mercy in the diagonal. %0a> Alternatively, they hear bad things about one who does not merit, accepting %0a> one's prayer to the extent of the judgment in the diagonal. %0a> %0a> If man's ears hear the prayer (which means that he speaks not from the %0a> depths of his heart, but with his mouth, so outwardly that his ears hear it, but %0a> not his heart), no one will accept it Above. Therefore, man must be watchful: %0a> no one should hear his prayer, for the speech of the prayer unites in the Upper %0a> World, in ZA, and the speech of the Upper World must not be heard. %0a> %0a> Consider how the Torah is read: one reads and the others keep silent. %0a> However, if they all read it out loud, they lessen the faith Above, for the voice and %0a> speech of one mingle with the voice and speech of the others, and undermine %0a> faith, i.e., Malchut. The voice and speech (ZA is called "voice" and Malchut is %0a> called "speech") of one must be similar to the voice and speech of the other. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 501 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Two reasons are mentioned above as to why a prayer must be speech without %0a> voice, unheard by man's ear. The first is that Malchut, who begets people, consists %0a> of two points: the Light cannot be received from Malchut with a measure of %0a> judgment, whereas the Light can be received from Malchut that is corrected in %0a> Bina with a measure of mercy. %0a> %0a> Similarly, man consists of a combination of these two points. If he merits, %0a> the measure of judgment becomes concealed, the measure of mercy is revealed, %0a> and he merits receiving the Upper Light. However, if he does not merit, the %0a> measure of judgment becomes revealed and the Light disappears from him. %0a> %0a> Therefore, the Upper ear has an inclined form so as to be able to receive the %0a> prayer of man-righteous one, him who merits the concealment of the measure %0a> of judgment, so that the listening ear would not arouse judgment, concealed %0a> in the speech of the prayer. Hence, if an outsider hears the prayer before it %0a> ascends, he evokes the judgment concealed in the speech of the prayer, and it %0a> cannot be heard Above. %0a> %0a> There is another reason for this: the speech of the prayer constitutes parts %0a> of Malchut. And he who prays must be a part of Malchut. Hence, the prayer %0a> must ascend and be included in the Supernal Malchut, called "speech." Then %0a> Malchut unites with ZA (voice) and the prayer is accepted, i.e., the Light is %0a> accepted from ZA. %0a> %0a> Therefore, one must not raise his voice during prayer so as to allow the %0a> Supernal voice, the Light of ZA, to descend to the praying person. The speech %0a> ascends to Malchut, merges with ZA with the help of Malchut, and receives a %0a> completely corrected voice from ZA. As a result, the prayer can receive the Light. %0a> It is therefore said that the words of a prayer pronounced by man's voice must %0a> not be heard. %0a> %0a> He who reads the Torah must also be a part of ZA, called "Torah." And the %0a> voice of one who reads Torah must be instead of the voice of ZA. Hence, it is %0a> forbidden to hear someone else's voice, for it will be the voice of one who exists %0a> under judgment, and not under mercy. %0a> %0a> Thus, the voice of an outsider harms the voice of one who reads the Torah, %0a> and Malchut is unable to receive the Light from ZA. Yet, if this is the voice and %0a> speech of one man, then the voice, called ZA, and speech, called Malchut, merge %0a> into one combination. But if voice and speech of an outsider join the reader's, %0a> it will harm him. %0a> %0a> With regard to everything mentioned above, one can say that only he %0a> who approaches the described state can understand what The Zohar narrates. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 502 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Spiritual actions are understood in one's heart, his desires, his properties. If %0a> they do not correspond to those that are described above, no explanation of any %0a> kind will help. An "outsider" designates man's "foreign" (distant from spiritual %0a> aspirations) thoughts and desires. %0a> %0a> When a quiet, concealed, and secret prayer ascends, the governor Azriel- %0a> Saba himself and all of his assistants, who are in charge of the 600,000 groups %0a> (camps), and all those who have eyes and ears emerge and kiss the ascending %0a> word of the prayer. %0a> %0a> This is said in the verse: "The Creator's eyes and ears are upon them." %0a> The Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous. The Creator's eyes refer to those %0a> below who have eyes, meaning the angels that exist in the firmament of Yesod de %0a> Assiya. They exist Above, at the degree of GAR, for eyes signify the property of %0a> Hochma. However, these eyes are the eyes of the Sefira Yesod, as it is written: "The %0a> Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous," as Yesod is called the "righteous one." %0a> %0a> The third firmament is the Sefirot Net^ah and Hod de Assiya. The prayer %0a> ascends to this firmament. The ruler Gadria, who controls this firmament with %0a> his assistants, acts three times a day during the ascent of the three lines to the %0a> world of Atzilut, when the luminous scepter of Light ascends and descends, but %0a> does not stay in one place, for Ohr Hochma of the left line (called the "scepter of %0a> Light") wants to shine. %0a> %0a> The word "scepter" (Hebrew, Sharvit) signifies eyesight, and Ohr Hochma is %0a> called the Light of eyesight. The scepter moves three times and conceals itself, %0a> because Hochma reveals itself only when the three lines move in the three points: %0a> Holam (the dot above the letters), Shuruk (the dot inside the letters), and Hirik %0a> (the dot below the letters). %0a> %0a> When the prayer, which is the middle line, ascends and carries the screen of %0a> Hirik, the scepter (the Light of the left line) descends and bows its head before %0a> the prayer, designating the concealment of GAR, called "head." This is because %0a> the middle line reduces the left line with the help of the screen of Hirik. This %0a> third firmament of Sefirot Netzah and Hod de Assiya is called the "firmament of %0a> the scepter," for the scepter of Light acts within it. %0a> %0a> When the prayer ascends, the ruler bows his head before it (diminishes his %0a> level) and then strikes the iridescent rock with his scepter. The rock stands at the %0a> center (the middle line) of the firmament, and 365 hosts emerge from the rock, %0a> which were concealed within it since the Torah descended to the earth. Because %0a> they objected to this descent, the Creator reproached them, and they concealed %0a> themselves in the rock. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 503 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Here, by analogy with the aforesaid and in accordance with the definitions %0a> of such notions as a scepter, a rock, hosts, Light, concealment, to %0a> bow," the reader is offered an opportunity to translate from the language of %0a> legends into the language of spiritual actions. And when the reader attains what %0a> is written, he will feel it within him! %0a> %0a> And they do not emerge from there, except for when the prayer ascends. %0a> Then they praise the Creator, saying: "Our Creator, how great is Your name %0a> upon the earth!" This prayer is called "Great," because it ascends to all these %0a> firmaments, and they bow before it. %0a> %0a> This occurs because the angels that opposed the descent of the Torah (see %0a> the article "Heaven and Earth"), i.e., the middle line, to the earth (Malchut and %0a> the worlds of BYA), emerge from the left line. And they wanted the left line to %0a> dominate in Malchut and in the worlds of BYA, but not the middle one, called %0a> the "Torah," which reduces the GAR of the Light of the left line. %0a> %0a> Malchut, called "earth," includes all the worlds of BYA. However, the Creator %0a> (middle line) reproached and compelled her to receive the Light of the middle %0a> line and conceal herself in the rock, in the forces of judgment, which exist in the %0a> middle line that stands at the center of the firmament. %0a> %0a> However, the prayer can ascend only by activating the left line, namely Bina %0a> and ZON that fell to the lower degree, then ascended once more above the %0a> firmament, and became the left line. They take the prayer that existed with %0a> them during their descent to the lower degree. %0a> %0a> This is why the ruler receives the scepter, the Light of the left line, for %0a> during the ascent of the prayer, the left line shines in his domain. The 365 hosts %0a> then awaken and receive the Light of the left line from the scepter. Hence, they %0a> exclaim: "The Creator, Our Lord, how great is Your name upon the earth!" for %0a> the prayer ascends to this firmament, called "Great," and includes the screen of %0a> Hirik of the left line, from the GAR. Thus, they bow their heads, i.e., do not use %0a> the GAR of Ohr Hochma, but only VAK. %0a> %0a> Afterward, the prayer clothes in the Supernal adornments and rises to the %0a> fourth firmament, Tifferet. Then the sun (Tifferet) emerges at its level, the Supreme %0a> ruler Shimshiel, and the 365 hosts ascend to this firmament along with him. %0a> They are called "the days of the sun," for these levels stem from the sun, Tifferet. %0a> And they all clothe and adorn Malchut in the Heavens of the Garden of Eden. %0a> %0a> The prayer pauses there to merge with the air of Gevura of those degrees, %0a> because it was not supposed to pause at the previous firmament, NHY, as they %0a> are included in Tifferet. And the prayer remains there until all the hosts have %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 504 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> risen with it to the fifth firmament (Gevura), where Gadriel rules; he is in charge %0a> of all the hosts of the other nations, for Gevura constitutes the left line, which %0a> the other nations hold on to. %0a> %0a> And when the prayer ascends, carrying within the screen of the middle %0a> line (which reduces the left line from GAR to VAK), it shakes him and all of his %0a> hosts, and they lose all their strength, emerge and bow their heads, i.e., GAR, %0a> and adorn this prayer. %0a> %0a> They ascend with it to the sixth firmament, Hesed, and the legions and hosts %0a> come forth and accept the prayer until they reach the seventy gates, HGT NHYM, %0a> each of which consists of ten, as Hesed includes all seven lower Sefirot. The Supreme %0a> ruler, Anafiel, stands there and adorns the prayer with seventy adornments. %0a> %0a> And since the prayer was adorned, all the legions and hosts of all the %0a> firmaments that accompanied the prayer from firmament to firmament unite %0a> and raise the prayer to the seventh firmament, Bina, which includes GAR. %0a> %0a> The prayer enters the seventh firmament, and the Supreme ruler Sandalphon, %0a> who is in charge of all the guards at the entrances, ushers the prayer into the %0a> seven halls of the world of Yetzira. These are the seven halls of the King, the %0a> seven halls of Malchut de Atzilut, where ZA rules. %0a> %0a> When the prayer, adorned with all of these adornments, ascends there, it %0a> unites ZA with Malchut, for everything grows with similarity to everything else. %0a> And the Creator's name, i.e., Malchut is adorned from Above and from below, %0a> and on all sides, as Malchut merges with ZA into one. And then Yesod (the %0a> righteous one) fills Malchut with its blessings. %0a> %0a> Happy is the lot of him who can put his prayer in proper order, so the %0a> Creator will clothe in this prayer. He waits until all the prayers of Israel finish %0a> ascending and unite into a complete and perfect prayer, whereupon everything %0a> will become perfect both Above and below. %0a> %0a> Besides the prayer, there are the Mitzvot of the Torah that depend on speech %0a> and action. There are six Mitzvot that depend on speech: %0a> %0a> 1. To fear the Great and Mighty Creator; %0a> %0a> 2. To love the Creator; %0a> %0a> 3. To bless the Creator; %0a> %0a> 4. To proclaim the Creator's unity; %0a> %0a> 5. To bless the nation, which is incumbent on Cohanim (priests); %0a> %0a> 6. To entrust one's soul with the Creator. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Raising a Prayer %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 505 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Out of the six above-mentioned Mitzvot, the first finds its place in the %0a> blessings that King David sang during his offerings in the Torah, where man %0a> must fear his Master, for these songs stand in a place called "fear" or Malchut. %0a> And all of these written blessings constitute the essence of fear of the Creator, %0a> Malchut. And man must sing these songs with his desires in fear. %0a> %0a> Man must achieve a level of spiritual development where his desires will %0a> coincide with what is said in the texts of these blessings. It is impossible to force %0a> someone to wish something; all our feelings are the product, the result of our %0a> spiritual level. The Light of that degree influences one's egoism and corrects it %0a> with the power of that degree. Therefore, man can only ask for correction, but %0a> %0a> Here we have a list of degrees that man must gradually go through in his %0a> correction. These degrees are usually called Mitzvot, and in all there are 620 of %0a> them between us and the Creator: 613 Mitzvot of the Torah for Israel (altruism) %0a> and seven Mit^ot of the Torah for all the nations (egoism). Here they are %0a> expounded in a different way: since the most important is to ask for correction %0a> (and if the request is genuine, the answer in the form of Light immediately %0a> descends to it), all of man's work on himself, all of his efforts in the study, work %0a> and actions are aimed only at the creation of a true request, MAN. Hence, the %0a> stages of man's spiritual development are described as his path in prayer; as if %0a> he stands and prays, although this process continues within him throughout his %0a> life on earth. %0a> %0a> The second Mitzva: to love the Creator (as it was repeatedly stated, this %0a> feeling is the result of correction; see "Introduction to the Study of Ten Sefirot," %0a> item 45— the four degrees of sensation of governance, from darkness to love), %0a> when in his prayer one reaches Ahavat Olam (great love) and Le El (for the %0a> Creator). These two blessings precede the appeal, Shema Israel (Hear, O Israel) %0a> and Ve Ahavta Et (and love the Creator), the blessing of the Creator for one's %0a> love for Him that follows the appeal Shema Israel. And this is the secret of love %0a> for the Creator. %0a> %0a> The third Mit^i/a: since man reaches a place in the prayer that is called %0a> Lehishtabe'ach (blessed is the Creator), he must attain praises and blessings of the %0a> Creator in his desire, as in parts of the prayer Yotzer Ohr (He who creates Light) %0a> and Yotzer HaMeohrot (maker of the stars). %0a> %0a> The fourth Mitzva is to proclaim the Creator's unity, i.e., Shema Israel (Hear, %0a> O Israel, our Creator is one!). From this point (degree) on, one must express %0a> the secret of the Creator's unity (in all His manifestations to man) in his heart's %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 506 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> desire (one's heart must be filled only with the sensation of the One, Upper %0a> Force). Afterward, the Mitzva to remember and remind others of the exodus %0a> from Egypt (egoism) is observed, as it is written: "Remember how you were a %0a> slave in Egypt." %0a> %0a> The fifth Mitzva is for a Cohen to bless the people (the Light's descent to the %0a> Partzuf), so that Israel will be included when the prayer (the Cohanim's blessing) %0a> ascends, for at this time (state), Knesset Israel (all those who correct themselves by %0a> aspiring to the Creator and constitute a part of Malchut de Atzilut), i.e., Malchut, %0a> receives a blessing (Light). %0a> %0a> The sixth Mitzva and the desired time (state, spiritual level when man wishes %0a> only to give all of his desires, i.e., his soul, to the Creator, meaning that he can %0a> act for the Creator's sake in all of his desires) is to entrust one's soul with the %0a> Creator with complete desire in one's heart. When one falls (willingly accepts %0a> the small state) on his face (Hochma) and proclaims (raises MAN): "I entrust my %0a> soul with You, O Creator." The intentions and desires of his heart are to give his %0a> soul completely to the Creator (this desire is the consequence of this spiritual %0a> degree and comes naturally to those who attain it). %0a> %0a> These six Mitzvot of the prayer correspond to the 600 Mitzvot of the Torah. %0a> And the remaining thirteen Mitzvot are required in order to attract the thirteen %0a> properties of mercy (thirteen Midot HaRachamim), which include all the rest. %0a> The prayer is adorned with 600 Mitzvot, which corresponds to HGT NHY, to %0a> what the prayer, Malchut, receives from ZA. %0a> %0a> Happy is he who heeded and focused his desire on this (who was able to %0a> raise a proper request for his correction), who completed all that was required %0a> each day (in the Creator's daylight), and directed his heart's intentions and %0a> desires to fulfill this Mitzva, which depends on the word. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The End %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Appendix One %0a> Further Reading %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> To help you determine which book you would like to read next, we %0a> have divided the books into five categories— Beginners, Intermediate, %0a> Advanced, All Around, and Textbooks.

At the heart of the %0a> book is a sequence of lessons revealing the nature of Kabbalah's wisdom and %0a> explaining how to attain it. For every person questioning "Who am I really?" %0a> and "Why am I on this planet?" this book is a must. %0a> %0a> Awakening to Kabbalah %0a> %0a> A distinctive, personal, and awe-filled introduction to an ancient wisdom %0a> tradition. In this book, Rav Laitman offers a deeper understanding of the %0a> fundamental teachings of Kabbalah, and how you can use its wisdom to clarify %0a> your relationship with others and the world around you. %0a> %0a> Using language both scientific and poetic, he probes the most profound ques- %0a> tions of spirituality and existence. This provocative, unique guide will inspire and %0a> invigorate you to see beyond the world as it is and the limitations of your every- %0a> day life, become closer to the Creator, and reach new depths of the soul. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Further Reading %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 509 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life %0a> %0a> Science explains the mechanisms that sustain life; Kabbalah explains why life %0a> exists. In Kabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life, Rav Laitman combines %0a> science and spirituality in a captivating dialogue that reveals life's meaning. %0a> %0a> For thousands of years Kabbalists have been writing that the world is a single %0a> entity divided into separate beings. Today the cutting-edge science of quantum %0a> physics states a very similar idea: that at the most fundamental level of matter, %0a> we are all literally one. %0a> %0a> Science proves that reality is affected by the observer who examines it; and %0a> so does Kabbalah. But Kabbalah makes an even bolder statement: even the %0a> Creator, the Maker of reality, is within the observer. In other words, God is %0a> inside of us; He doesn't exist anywhere else. When we pass away, so does He. %0a> %0a> These earthshaking concepts and more are eloquently introduced so that %0a> even readers new to Kabbalah or science will easily understand them. Therefore, %0a> if you're just a little curious about why you are here, what life means, and what %0a> you can do to enjoy it more, this book is for you. %0a> %0a> From Chaos to Harmony %0a> %0a> Many researchers and scientists agree that the ego is the reason behind the %0a> perilous state our world is in today. Laitman's groundbreaking book not only %0a> demonstrates that ego has been the basis for all suffering throughout human %0a> history, but also shows how we can turn our plight to pleasure. %0a> %0a> The book contains a clear analysis of the human soul and its problems, and %0a> provides a "roadmap" of what we need to do to once again be happy. From Chaos %0a> to Harmony explains how we can rise to a new level of existence on personal, %0a> social, national, and international levels. %0a> %0a> INTERMEDIATE %0a> %0a> The Kabbalah Experience %0a> %0a> The depth of the wisdom revealed in the questions and answers within this %0a> book will inspire readers to reflect and contemplate. This is not a book to race %0a> through, but rather one that should be read thoughtfully and carefully. With %0a> this approach, readers will begin to experience a growing sense of enlightenment %0a> while simply absorbing the answers to the questions every Kabbalah student %0a> asks along the way. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 510 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Appendix One %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> The Kabbalah Experience is a guide from the past to the future, revealing %0a> situations that all students of Kabbalah will experience at some point along %0a> their journeys. For those who cherish every moment in life, this book offers %0a> unparalleled insights into the timeless wisdom of Kabbalah. %0a> %0a> The Path of Kahhalah %0a> %0a> This unique book combines beginners' material with more advanced concepts %0a> and teachings. If you have read a book or two of Laitman's, you will find this %0a> book very easy to relate to. %0a> %0a> While touching upon basic concepts such as perception of reality and Freedom %0a> of Choice, The Path of Kabbalah goes deeper and expands beyond the scope of %0a> beginners' books. The structure of the worlds, for example, is explained in greater %0a> detail here than in the "pure" beginners' books. Also described is the spiritual %0a> root of mundane matters such as the Hebrew calendar and the holidays. %0a> %0a> ADVANCED %0a> %0a> The Science of Kabbalah %0a> %0a> Kabbalist and scientist Rav Michael Laitman, PhD, designed this book to %0a> introduce readers to the special language and terms of the authentic wisdom %0a> of Kabbalah. Here, Rav Laitman reveals authentic Kabbalah in a manner both %0a> rational and mature. Readers are gradually led to understand the logical design %0a> of the Universe and the life that exists in it. %0a> %0a> The Science of Kabbalah, a revolutionary work unmatched in its clarity, %0a> depth, and appeal to the intellect, will enable readers to approach the more %0a> technical works of Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag), such as The Study %0a> of the Ten Sefirot and The Book of Zohar. Readers of this book will enjoy the %0a> satisfying answers to the riddles of life that only authentic Kabbalah provides. %0a> Travel through the pages and prepare for an astonishing journey into the %0a> Upper Worlds. %0a> %0a> Introduction to the Book of Zohar %0a> %0a> This volume, along with The Science of Kabbalah, is a required preparation %0a> for those who wish to understand the hidden message of The Book of Zohar. %0a> Among the many helpful topics dealt with in this text is an introduction to the %0a> "language of roots and branches," without which the stories in The Zohar are %0a> mere fable and legend. Introduction to the Book of Zohar will provide readers with %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Further Reading %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 511 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> the necessary tools to understand authentic Kabbalah as it was originally meant %0a> to be, as a means to attain the Upper Worlds. %0a> %0a> The Zohar %0a> %0a> The Book of Zohar (The Book of Radiance) is an ageless source of wisdom and the %0a> basis for all Kabbalistic literature. Since its appearance nearly 2,000 years ago, it %0a> has been the primary, and often only, source used by Kabbalists. %0a> %0a> For centuries, Kabbalah was hidden from the public, which was deemed %0a> not yet ready to receive it. However, our generation has been designated by %0a> Kabbalists as the first generation that is ready to grasp the concepts in The Zohar. %0a> Now, we can put these principles into practice in our lives. %0a> %0a> Written in a unique and metaphorical language, The Book of Zohar enriches %0a> our understanding of reality and widens our worldview. Although the text %0a> deals with one subject only— how to relate to the Creator— it approaches it from %0a> different angles. This allows each of us to find the particular phrase or word that %0a> will carry us into the depths of this profound and timeless wisdom. %0a> %0a> ALL AROUND %0a> %0a> Attaining the Worlds Beyond %0a> %0a> From the introduction to Attaining the Worlds Beyond: "...Not feeling well on %0a> the Jewish New Year in September 1991, my teacher called me to his bedside %0a> and handed me his notebook, saying, 'Take it and learn from it.' The following %0a> morning, my teacher perished in my arms, leaving me and many of his other %0a> disciples without guidance in this world. %0a> %0a> "He used to say, 'I want to teach you to turn to the Creator, rather than %0a> to me, because He is the only strength, the only Source of all that exists, the %0a> only One who can really help you, and He awaits your prayers for help. When %0a> you seek help in your search for freedom from the bondage of this world, help %0a> in elevating yourself above this world, help in finding the self, and help in %0a> determining your purpose in life, you must turn to the Creator, who sends you %0a> all those aspirations in order to compel you to turn to Him.'" %0a> %0a> Attaining the Worlds Beyond holds within it the content of that notebook, %0a> as well as other inspiring texts. This book reaches out to all those seekers who %0a> want to find a logical, reliable way to understand the world's phenomena. This %0a> fascinating introduction to the wisdom of Kabbalah will enlighten the mind, %0a> invigorate the heart, and move readers to the depths of their souls. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 512 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Appendix One %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Basic Concepts in Kabbalah %0a> %0a> This is a book to help readers cultivate an approach to the concepts of Kabbalah, %0a> to spiritual objects, and to spiritual terms. By reading and re-reading in this %0a> book, one develops internal observations, senses, and approaches that did not %0a> previously exist within. These newly acquired observations are like sensors that %0a> "feel" the space around us that is hidden from our ordinary senses. %0a> %0a> Hence, Basic Concepts in Kabbalah is intended to foster the contemplation %0a> of spiritual terms. Once we are integrated with these terms, we can begin to see, %0a> with our inner vision, the unveiling of the spiritual structure that surrounds us, %0a> almost as if a mist has been lifted. %0a> %0a> Again, this book is not aimed at the study of facts. Instead, it is a book for %0a> those who wish to awaken the deepest and subtlest sensations they can possess. %0a> %0a> Together Forever %0a> %0a> On the surface, Together Forever is a children's story. But like all good children's %0a> stories, it transcends boundaries of age, culture, and upbringing. %0a> %0a> In Together Forever, the author tells us that if we are patient and endure the %0a> trials we encounter along our life's path, we will become stronger, braver, and %0a> wiser. Instead of growing weaker, we will learn to create our own magic and our %0a> own wonders as only a magician can. %0a> %0a> In this warm, tender tale, Michael Laitman shares with children and %0a> parents alike some of the gems and charms of the spiritual world. The wisdom %0a> of Kabbalah is filled with spellbinding stories. Together Forever is yet another gift %0a> from this ageless source of wisdom, whose lessons make our lives richer, easier, %0a> and far more fulfilling. %0a> %0a> TEXTBOOKS %0a> Shamati %0a> %0a> Rav Michael Laitman's words on the book: Among all the texts and notes that %0a> were used by my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), %0a> there was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained %0a> the transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi %0a> Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book %0a> of Zohar, The Study of the Ten Sefirot (a commentary on the texts of the Kabbalist, %0a> Ari), and of many other works on Kabbalah. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Further Reading %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 513 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Not feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash %0a> summoned me to his bedside and handed me a notebook, whose cover contained %0a> only one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said, "Take %0a> it and learn from it." The following morning, my teacher perished in my arms, %0a> leaving me and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. %0a> %0a> Committed to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, %0a> I published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's %0a> transforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique %0a> and compelling creation. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Appendix Two %0a> About Bnei Baruch %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Bnei Baruch is a group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of %0a> Kabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 20 languages %0a> are based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from %0a> generation to generation. %0a> %0a> HISTORY AND ORIGIN %0a> %0a> In 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom HaLevi %0a> Ashlag (The Rabash), Rav Michael Laitman, Professor of Ontology and the %0a> Theory of Knowledge, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah, and MSc in Medical %0a> Bio-Cybernetics, established a Kabbalah study group called "Bnei Baruch." He %0a> called it Bnei Baruch (Sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his %0a> mentor, whose side he never left in the final twelve years of his life, from 1979 %0a> to 1991. Rav Laitman had been Ashlag's prime student and personal assistant, %0a> and is recognized as the successor to Rabash's teaching method. %0a> %0a> The Rabash was the firstborn son and successor of Rabbi Yehuda Leib %0a> HaLevi Ashlag, the greatest Kabbalist of the 20 th century. Rabbi Ashlag authored %0a> the most authoritative and comprehensive commentary on The Book of Zohar, %0a> titled The Sulam Commentary (The Ladder Commentary). He was the first to reveal %0a> the complete method for spiritual ascent, and thus was known as Baal HaSulam %0a> (Owner of the Ladder). %0a> %0a> Today, Bnei Baruch bases its entire study method on the path paved by %0a> these two great spiritual leaders. %0a> %0a> THE STUDY METHOD %0a> %0a> The unique study method developed by Baal HaSulam and his son, the %0a> Rabash, is taught and applied on a daily basis by Bnei Baruch. This method %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 515 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 516 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Appendix Two %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> relies on authentic Kabbalah sources such as The Book of Zohar, by Rabbi %0a> Shimon Bar-Yochai, The Tree of Life, by the Holy Ari, and The Study of the Ten %0a> Sefirot, by Baal HaSulam. %0a> %0a> While the study relies on authentic Kabbalah sources, it is carried out in %0a> simple language and uses a scientific, contemporary approach. Developing this %0a> approach has made Bnei Baruch an internationally respected organization, both %0a> in Israel and in the world at large. %0a> %0a> The unique combination of an academic study method and personal %0a> experiences broadens the students' perspective and awards them a new %0a> perception of the reality they live in. Those on the spiritual path are thus given %0a> the necessary tools to research themselves and their surrounding reality. %0a> %0a> THE MESSAGE %0a> %0a> Bnei Baruch is a diverse movement of many thousands of students worldwide. %0a> Students can choose their own paths and the personal intensity of their studies, %0a> according to their unique conditions and abilities. The essence of the message %0a> disseminated by Bnei Baruch is universal: unity of the people, unity of nations %0a> and love of man. %0a> %0a> For millennia, Kabbalists have been teaching that love of man should be the %0a> foundation of all human relations. This love prevailed in the days of Abraham, %0a> Moses, and the group of Kabbalists that they established. If we make room for %0a> these seasoned, yet contemporary values, we will discover that we possess the %0a> power to put differences aside and unite. %0a> %0a> The wisdom of Kabbalah, hidden for millennia, has been waiting for the time %0a> when we would be sufficiently developed and ready to implement its message. %0a> Now, it is emerging as a solution that can unite diverse factions everywhere, %0a> better enabling us, as individuals and as a society, to meet today's challenges. %0a> %0a> ACTIVITIES %0a> %0a> Bnei Baruch was established on the premise that "only by expansion of the %0a> wisdom of Kabbalah to the public can we be awarded complete redemption" %0a> (Baal HaSulam). %0a> %0a> Therefore, Bnei Baruch offers a variety of ways for people to explore and %0a> discover the purpose of their lives, providing careful guidance for the beginners %0a> and the advanced students alike. %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> About Bnei Baruch %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> 517 %0a> %0a> %0a> %0a> Kabbalah Today %0a> %0a> Kabbalah Today is a free monthly paper produced and disseminated by Bnei Ba- %0a> ruch.

Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) put it all on paper %0a%3c and then hid it, as humanity was not %0a%3c ready for it. Today, we are ready for the %0a%3c revelation of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi), %0a%3c author of The Book of Zohar (The Book of %0a%3c Radiance) was a Tana— a great sage in the early Common Era centuries. Rashbi's %0a%3c name is tied to numerous legends, and he is mentioned constantly in the Talmud %0a%3c and in the Midrash, the sacred Hebrew texts of his time. He lived in Sidon and %0a%3c in Meron, and established a seminary in the Western Galilee. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashbi was born and raised in the Galilee (a mountainous region in %0a%3c today's Northern Israel). Even as a child, he was not like other children his age. %0a%3c Questions such as, "What is the purpose of my life?" "Who am I?" and "How is %0a%3c the world built?" plagued him and demanded answers. %0a%3c %0a%3c In those days, life in Galilee was very harsh: the Romans persecuted Jews %0a%3c and continually invented new laws to make their lives more difficult. Among %0a%3c these laws was a decree that prohibited Jews from studying the Torah (then %0a%3c synonymous with Kabbalah). %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 The articles, "About Rabbi Shimon Bar-^lbchai" and "About The Book of Zohar" are presented %0a%3c here courtesy of the paper Kabbalah Today. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A77A.1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 711' 7^ |) W '21 • %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( I %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, despite the Romans' prohibition, Rashbi immersed himself in the %0a%3c Kabbalah and tried to understand its subtle teachings. He felt that beneath the %0a%3c Biblical stories was a profound and hidden truth, which held the answers to his %0a%3c persistent questions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gradually, Rabbi Shimon came to realize that he had to find a teacher %0a%3c who had already been through the spiritual path, gained experience, and could %0a%3c guide others up the spiritual ladder. He decided to join the group of the greatest %0a%3c Kabbalist of the time— Rabbi Akiva— a decision that turned out to be the turning %0a%3c point in Rashbi's life. %0a%3c %0a%3c STUDYING WITH RABBI AKIVA %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon was an avid, devoted student, burning with desire to discover %0a%3c the Higher realms of reality. Before long, he was one of Rabbi Akiva's prime %0a%3c students. He studied with Rabbi Akiva for thirteen years, and achieved the %0a%3c highest levels on the spiritual ladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Bar-Kokheva revolt abruptly ended the great days of Rabbi Akiva's %0a%3c seminary. Almost all of his 24,000 students died in plagues, and in fierce battles %0a%3c against the Romans. Of the 24,000 students, only five survived, and Rashbi was %0a%3c among them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashbi was among the leaders of the Bar-Kokheva revolt against the Roman %0a%3c rule in the land of Israel. His resistance became even more fierce and unyielding %0a%3c when he'd learned how his teacher, Rabbi Akiva, had been ruthlessly executed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Talmud writes that once, when Rashbi spoke against the Roman rule, %0a%3c a fellow Jew heard him and alerted the Roman authorities. In consequence, %0a%3c Rashbi was tried in absentia and was sentenced to death. The Roman emperor %0a%3c sent men in search of him, but to their disappointment, Rashbi seemed to have %0a%3c vanished into thin air. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CAVE AT PECTIN %0a%3c %0a%3c Legends have it that Rashbi and his son fled to the Galilee, hid in a cave at %0a%3c Peqi'in, a village in the north of Israel, and remained there for thirteen years. %0a%3c During that time, they delved in the secrets of the wisdom of the hidden. Their %0a%3c efforts succeeded, and they discovered the entire system of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c After thirteen years in a cave, Rashbi heard that the Roman emperor had %0a%3c died. He could finally heave a sigh of relief. After leaving the cave, Rashbi %0a%3c gathered nine students and went with them to a small cave in Meron, known as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Prologue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Idra Raba (Great Assembly). With their help, he wrote The Book of Zohar, %0a%3c the most important book of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Baal HaSulam described Rashbi and his students as the only beings who %0a%3c achieved perfection, the 125 spiritual degrees that complete the correction %0a%3c of one's soul. When he finished his commentary on The Book of Zohar, Baal %0a%3c HaSulam held a festive meal to celebrate its completion. At that celebration, he %0a%3c stated that "...prior to the days of the Messiah, it is impossible to be awarded all %0a%3c 125 degrees... except the Rashbi and his contemporaries, meaning the authors %0a%3c of The Book of Zohar. They were awarded all 125 degrees in completeness, even %0a%3c though they lived prior to the days of the Messiah. Hence, we often find in %0a%3c The Zohar that there will not be a generation such as the Rashbi's until the %0a%3c generation of the Messiah King. This is why his composition made such a strong %0a%3c impression in the world, since the secrets of the Torah in it occupy the level of %0a%3c all 125 degrees. This is also why it is said in The Zohar that The Book of Zohar will %0a%3c not be revealed except at the end of days, meaning in the days of the Messiah." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE IDRA RABA (GREAT ASSEMBLY) AND THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a%3c %0a%3c Idra Raba is a cave located in the north of Israel, between Meron and Zephath. %0a%3c Rashbi took his students to this cave, and there he wrote The Book of Zohar. It is %0a%3c almost impossible to understand how great Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai really was. %0a%3c He belongs, as Baal HaSulam puts it, to the highest Inner Light. This is why he %0a%3c had to use Rabbi Abba to put his words into writing. In The Book of Zohar, the %0a%3c Rashbi tells his students: "I am arranging you as follows: Rabbi Abba will write, %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar, my son, will study orally, and the rest of the friends will converse %0a%3c in their hearts" (Zohar, Haazinu). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar was written in the second century CE, not long after the %0a%3c ruin of the Second Temple and the beginning of the last exile of the people %0a%3c of Israel from its land. But even prior to the exile, Rashbi predicted that The %0a%3c Book of Zohar would only be revealed at the end of the exile. He stated that its %0a%3c appearance to the masses would symbolize the end of the spiritual exile: "...in it, %0a%3c they will come out of the exile with mercy" (Zohar, Naso). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is also written in The Book of Zohar that its wisdom would be revealed %0a%3c to all toward the end of the six thousand years, the period allotted to the %0a%3c correction of humanity: "And when it is near the days of the Messiah, even %0a%3c infants in the world are destined to find the secrets of the wisdom, and know %0a%3c in them the ends and the calculations of redemption, and at that time it will %0a%3c be revealed to all" (Zohar, VaYera). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE REINCARNATION OF A UNIQUE SOUL %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashbi is an incarnation of a unique soul, which coordinates and connects %0a%3c the Upper Force to every creation. This soul comes down into our world and %0a%3c incarnates in the patriarchs of Kabbalah. This is the order of its appearance: %0a%3c Abraham, Moses, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai, the ARI (Rabbi Isaac Luria), and %0a%3c Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). Each incarnation of this soul promotes %0a%3c humanity to a new spiritual degree and leaves its mark in Kabbalah books, which %0a%3c serve the generations that follow. %0a%3c %0a%3c An example of this process can be found in special sections of The Zohar %0a%3c called Raia Meheimna (The Loyal Shepherd). In these parts, Rashbi speaks from %0a%3c a state of clothing in Moses' soul. Another example of this is the book, Shaar %0a%3c HaGilgulim (Gate of Reincarnations), where Rashbi speaks from a state of clothing %0a%3c in the soul of the ARI. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar is undoubtedly unique and one of the world's most %0a%3c renowned compositions. Since its writing, thousands of stories have been %0a%3c linked to The Zohar, and the book is still shrouded in mystery today. The %0a%3c fascination around it is so great that even though the book is completely %0a%3c incomprehensible to our generation without proper interpretation, millions %0a%3c of people diligently read it. %0a%3c %0a%3c RASHBI'S DEPARTURE %0a%3c %0a%3c According to tradition, Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai passed away in the presence %0a%3c of his friends on Lag BaOmer (the 33 rd day of the Omer count, which starts on %0a%3c the first day of Passover) of the year 160 CE, and was buried in Meron. With his %0a%3c death, the soul of a giant Kabbalist completed its task in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashbi fulfilled his destination. Hundreds of thousands visit his gravesite %0a%3c yearly, trying to sense some of the Light that he had brought to the world. The %0a%3c greatest Kabbalists praise his composition and repeatedly claim that The Book of %0a%3c Zohar is destined to bring redemption to the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Kook, the first Chief Rabbi of Israel, writes about the Zohar (Ohr %0a%3c Yakar): "This composition, called The Book of Zohar, is like Noah's Ark, where %0a%3c there were many kinds, but those kinds and families could not exist unless %0a%3c by entering the ark. ...Thus the righteous will enter the secret of the Light %0a%3c of this composition to persist, and thus is the virtue of the composition, %0a%3c that immediately when engaging, with his desire for the love of God, it %0a%3c will draw him as a magnet draws the iron. And he will enter it to save his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Prologue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c soul and spirit and his correction. And even if he is wicked, there is no fear %0a%3c should he enter." %0a%3c %0a%3c We are living in a historic time. The soul of Rashbi is completing its mission %0a%3c in our generation, and thanks to this spiritual giant, who lived nearly 2,000 %0a%3c years ago, the wisdom of Kabbalah is emerging so we may all ascend to a life of %0a%3c eternity and wholeness. %0a%3c %0a%3c ABOUT THE BOOK OF ZOHAR %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar is the most mysterious, and at the same time the most %0a%3c significant book of Kabbalah. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear %0a%3c that although The Book of Zohar was written eighteen centuries ago, it was %0a%3c actually written for our time. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam) opened it %0a%3c to us and rekindled what has long been forgotten from our hearts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The depth of the wisdom in The Book of Zohar is locked behind a thousand doors. %0a%3c %0a%3c -Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), "Preface to the Book of Zohar" %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the dawn of humanity, unique individuals climbed the spiritual ladder %0a%3c and achieved the highest level of bonding with the Upper Force, the Creator. %0a%3c We call those people "Kabbalists." %0a%3c %0a%3c Through this bonding, they came to understand that the whole of reality, %0a%3c from the highest spiritual worlds down to our world, is founded on love and %0a%3c bestowal. They realized that there is nothing in the world except for this Force, %0a%3c and that everything that happens in reality was made only to bring humanity to %0a%3c permanent existence with this sensation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalists have searched and found the answers to every question they %0a%3c asked— the purpose of our lives, the structure of the world, and how we can %0a%3c determine our destiny. They wrote about what they discovered in books such as %0a%3c Raziel Hamalaach (The Angel Raziel), Sefer Yetzira (The Book of Creation), Etz Chaim %0a%3c (The Tree of Life), and others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the books, the most seminal, mysterious, and profound is The Book %0a%3c of Zohar (The Book of Radiance). The Book of Zohar describes the hidden system %0a%3c of the Upper Guidance. It depicts the worlds, the great powers that govern %0a%3c them, and how one who chooses to study Kabbalah affects his or her own fate %0a%3c and that of humanity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also explains how every event cascades from the Upper World to %0a%3c ours, and the dressings it acquires here. But what makes The Zohar unique is the %0a%3c fact that it was not written for its contemporaries; it was rather intended for a %0a%3c generation that would live two millennia later— our generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c REMOVING THE COVERS %0a%3c %0a%3c Our generation stands at the very threshold of redemption, if we only know how to spread %0a%3c the wisdom of the hidden in the masses. %0a%3c %0a%3c -Baal HaSulam, "Messiah's Horn" %0a%3c %0a%3c The twentieth century has brought unprecedented changes. These opened the %0a%3c door to a whole new phase, which the greatest Kabbalists have been describing %0a%3c for centuries in their writings. The greatest change of all is that in this century, %0a%3c Kabbalists state that studying Kabbalah is not only permitted, it is a must! %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in The Book of Zohar itself that the wisdom of Kabbalah would %0a%3c begin its spreading from the year 1840. The great 18 th century Kabbalist, The %0a%3c Vilna Gaon (GRA), wrote in his book Kol HaTor (Voice of the Turtledove) that the %0a%3c process of the revelation of the Kabbalah would begin in 1990. In his book, Even %0a%3c Shlemah (A Perfect and Just Weight), Chapter 11, he even stated that redemption %0a%3c depends primarily on the study of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Kook explained that "the great spiritual questions that were once %0a%3c resolved only for the great and the excellent, must now be resolved to various %0a%3c degrees within the entire nation" (Eder HaYaker ve Ikvey HaTzon, p. 144). %0a%3c %0a%3c But it was Baal HaSulam who turned the words of the Kabbalists from %0a%3c a vision to a tangible reality. He clearly saw that the time had come to allow %0a%3c everyone to study The Book of Zohar. He claimed that by studying The Zohar, the %0a%3c whole of humanity would rise and attain the spiritual world. %0a%3c %0a%3c With this vision in mind, Baal HaSulam devoted himself to composing a %0a%3c comprehensive, accurate, and systematic interpretation of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c His goal was to unveil the book to the public and make it suitable for the souls %0a%3c of our generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the introduction to his commentary on The Zohar, he explained why he %0a%3c wrote it: "I have named the commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) to indicate that %0a%3c the function of my commentary is as the function of any ladder. If you have %0a%3c an attic filled with abundance, you need only a ladder to climb it, and all the %0a%3c bounty in the world will be in your hands." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Prologue %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ACCELERATING THE SPREAD OF THE WISDOM %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Kabbalists dreamed of our generation, when the whole of humanity %0a%3c could discover the wondrous things they already had. They prayed that through %0a%3c reading the authentic sources they had left for us, we, too, would achieve %0a%3c bonding with the Upper Force, as did they. In his commentary on The Book of %0a%3c Zohar, Baal HaSulam threw us a rope, "a life buoy." In doing so, he paved our %0a%3c way to a future of abundance and prosperity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Baal HaSulam called upon us to give greater weight to engagement in the %0a%3c wisdom of Kabbalah, and accelerate the spreading of the wisdom. He knew %0a%3c that only the wisdom of Kabbalah could elevate the world to the spiritual %0a%3c realm and into the eternity that Kabbalists had been experiencing throughout %0a%3c the generations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Webster's Dictionary defines a generation as "a group of individuals born %0a%3c and living contemporaneously (at the same time)." In Kabbalah, however, a %0a%3c generation is a spiritual phase. According to great Kabbalists such as the Holy %0a%3c ARI, our generation— our spiritual phase— began in the sixteenth century. %0a%3c %0a%3c The longer we wait with the spiritual ascension our generation is meant to %0a%3c achieve, the greater will be our discomfort. The spiritual realm, which determines %0a%3c what happens in our world, will increase its pressure on us until we decide to %0a%3c achieve this realm for ourselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the words of the great Kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Azulai (in his %0a%3c introduction to the book, Ohr ha Chama (Light of the Sun)), "I have found it %0a%3c written that the above decree to not openly engage in the wisdom of truth was %0a%3c only for a time— until the end of the 1490. From then on ... the sentence has %0a%3c been lifted, and permission was given to engage in The Book of Zohar. And from %0a%3c the year 1540 it has become praiseworthy to engage in great numbers since it %0a%3c is by virtue of this the Messiah King will come, and not by another virtue. It is %0a%3c inappropriate to be negligent." %0a%3c %0a%3c "But the wise shall understand that their elevation comes from the Creator, %0a%3c the Tree of Life. And they who are righteous shall shine like the brightness of %0a%3c the firmament" (Daniel, 12:3). 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c "By virtue of Rabbi Shimon's composition, The Book of Zohar, from the %0a%3c Supernal Force that brings all things back to the Creator, at the end of days, the %0a%3c children of Israel will taste from the Tree of Life, which is The Book of Zohar; and %0a%3c they will be redeemed from exile by the Creator's mercy" (Naso, 90). %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 To facilitate comprehension of the spiritual meaning of ancient Hebrew sources, quotes are not %0a%3c direct translations, but rather reflect the Kabbalistic meaning of the texts. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar narrates that Rabbi Shimon Bar-Yochai (Rashbi) and his son, %0a%3c Rabbi Aba, attained the level of Prophet Eliyahu (Elijah). Hence, it is said that %0a%3c Eliyahu himself visited their cave and taught them the Torah. (Incidentally, the %0a%3c cave in the village of Peqi'in still exists today.) %0a%3c %0a%3c The author of Divrey Yoel (The Words of Yoel) wrote the following in the book %0a%3c The Torah of Rashbi: "Before Rabbi Shimon studied the secrets of the Torah, %0a%3c there was a rule in the cave— to settle disputes according to the opinion of Rabbi %0a%3c Yehuda, the author of the Talmud. However, after Rabbi Shimon left the cave, %0a%3c everything that he had written in The Zohar was considered to have exceeded all %0a%3c human attainments." Rashbi himself received the name Butzina Kadisha (Holy %0a%3c Candle), as he had attained the soul of Moshe (Moses). %0a%3c %0a%3c Verdicts on legislative and procedural matters are rendered in accordance %0a%3c with the Talmud or The Book of Zohar, depending on where this matter is %0a%3c examined more strictly. If the matter is mentioned neither in the Talmud nor %0a%3c in The Zohar, then the decision is based on the source that best elucidates this %0a%3c matter. If the disputed matter is between the Talmud and the legislators, the %0a%3c decision is based on the assertion from The Book of Zohar. If the legislators %0a%3c themselves cannot come to an agreement on the matter in dispute, the decision %0a%3c is based on the opinion of The Zohar (Mishna Brura, 25, 42). %0a%3c %0a%3c The great follower of Rashbi, an heir (next receiver) to his soul, Rabbi Isaac %0a%3c Luria (The Holy ARI) wrote that his soul was a return of the soul of Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon, and the soul of Rabbi Shimon was a return of the soul of Moshe %0a%3c (Shaar HaGilgulim, item 64). He also wrote that the soul of Moshe clothed %0a%3c in Rashbi to correct the soul of Achiya HaShiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite), who %0a%3c "corrupted" Malchut on account of the sin of King Yerav'am (Jeroboam), which %0a%3c prompted the transgression of all Israel. Hence, the soul of Rashbi appeared %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to correct Israel's sins. The part of The Zohar titled Raya Meheimna (Loyal %0a%3c Shepherd) relates how Rashbi attained the soul of Moshe, merged with it, and %0a%3c attained the supernal wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c In his works Maranan ve Rahanan and Kli Yakar (Melachim, 2, 12), the great %0a%3c HaChida also says that Rashbi's entire work lay in correction of the sin of %0a%3c Achiya HaShiloni. %0a%3c %0a%3c As Rashbi says in the Talmud (Sukkah, 45, 2): "I can redeem the entire %0a%3c world from judgment from the day of my birth to the present day. And if my %0a%3c son is with me, from the day the world was created to the present day. And if %0a%3c Yotam Ben Uziyahu is with us, from the day the world was created to its end." %0a%3c The book of Melachim narrates about Yotam Ben Uziyahu (20, 15). %0a%3c %0a%3c After the verdict was lifted, Rashbi founded his seminary in the settlement %0a%3c of Tekoa and in the village of Meron. There he taught his disciples Kabbalah %0a%3c and wrote The Book of Zohar, thereby revealing what was forbidden to reveal from %0a%3c the time of Israel's reception of the Torah (Tikuney Zohar, Hakdamah, p. 17). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, to write down all the secrets of the Torah, Rabbi Shimon had %0a%3c to express them in a secret form. Rashbi's disciple, Rabbi Aba, had a unique %0a%3c quality to his soul. This quality enabled him to convey spiritual knowledge in %0a%3c a secret, concealed form. Hence, Rabbi Shimon asked his disciple to express %0a%3c his thoughts for him, that is, to commit Rashbi's thoughts to paper. The ARI %0a%3c explained it in the following way: "The Book of Zohar must remain concealed %0a%3c until the generation of the coming of the Mashiach (Messiah), as through the %0a%3c study of this book will humankind return from its spiritual exile" (The ARI, %0a%3c Shaar HaHakdamot, Hakdamah, p. 3). That is why Rabbi Aba wrote the teachings %0a%3c of Rabbi Shimon in Aramaic, as it is the reverse side of Hebrew. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ARI wrote (Maamarey Rashbi (Articles of Rashbi), p. 100) that the writing %0a%3c of The Zohar in a secret form was possible because the soul of Rabbi Aba %0a%3c originated from the Surrounding Light, and not from the Inner Light. For this %0a%3c reason, the ARI explained, he could express the most supernal wisdom in a %0a%3c secret form as simple stories. %0a%3c %0a%3c (Rabbi Shimon lived approximately to the age of eighty and passed away on %0a%3c the holiday of Lag BaOmer, the eighteenth day in the month lyar, surrounded by %0a%3c his disciples, and recognized by the entire nation. This day is celebrated as the %0a%3c holiday of Light. Rabbi Shimon's body was buried in a cave off Mount Meron, %0a%3c and the body of his son, Rabbi Elazar, is buried a few meters from him.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Like the subsequent compositions of the ARI and other Kabbalists (evidently, %0a%3c such is the lot of all true spiritual books), The Book of Zohar was concealed for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c some 1,100 years in a cave near Meron, since the day it was written, until an %0a%3c Arab man found it and sold it in the market as wrapping cloth. %0a%3c %0a%3c Part of the torn sheets fell into the hands of a sage, who recognized and %0a%3c appreciated the value of the writings. After a long search, he recovered many %0a%3c sheets from refuse bins or bought them from spice vendors, who were selling %0a%3c their merchandise wrapped in the sheets of The Zohar. It was out of these %0a%3c recovered sheets that the book (as we know it today) was compiled. %0a%3c %0a%3c For many centuries, since that time until today, The Book of Zohar has been %0a%3c the subject of controversy. Philosophers, scientists, and other "sages," still %0a%3c debate it today. Yet, the fact remains that only a Kabbalist, one who ascends to a %0a%3c particular spiritual degree, attains what this book conveys. To all other people, it %0a%3c seems like a collection of narratives, stories, and ancient philosophy. Only those %0a%3c who do not comprehend this book argue over it; but Kabbalists know for certain %0a%3c that Rashbi's book is the greatest source of spiritual attainment that the Creator %0a%3c imparted upon the people in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although The Book of Zohar was written in the second century, only Rabbi %0a%3c Yehuda Ashlag was able to provide a full commentary on it in the 1930s-40s. The %0a%3c reason for the concealment of The Zohar from the second century to thirteenth %0a%3c century and the lack of a complete commentary on it for eighteen centuries is %0a%3c explained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar." %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Ashlag called his commentary HaSulam (The Ladder) because by %0a%3c studying it, one can ascend the spiritual degrees of attainment of the Upper %0a%3c Worlds as one would climb a ladder in our world. Following the publishing of %0a%3c the Sulam commentary, Rabbi Ashlag received the epithet Baal HaSulam (Owner %0a%3c of the Ladder), as it is customary among sages of the Torah to call a person not %0a%3c by his name, but according to his highest attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE BOOK OF ZOHAR CONTAINS: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (The Introduction of the Book of Zohar)— containing %0a%3c several articles that fully reveal the inner meaning of the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Sefer HaZohar (The Book of Zohar)— divided into parts and chapters that %0a%3c correspond to the weekly portions of the Torah: %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Beresheet (Genesis): Beresheet, NoacK, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Chaiey %0a%3c Sarah, Toldot, Vayetze, Vayishlach, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Vayichi. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Shemot (Exodus): Shemot, Vayera, Bo, Beshalach, Yitro, Mishpatim, %0a%3c Terumah (Safra de Tzniuta), Tetzaveh, Ki Tissa, Veyikahel, Pekudey. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Vayikra (Leviticus): Vayikra, Tzav, Shmini, Tazria, Metzura, %0a%3c Acharey, Kedushim, Emor, BaHar, Vechukotay. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Bamidbar (Numbers): Bamidbar, Naso (Idra Raba), Baalotcha, %0a%3c Shlach Lecha, Korach, Chukat, Balak, Pinchas, Matot. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Devarim (Deuteronomy)'. VeEtchanen, Ekev, Shoftim, Titze, %0a%3c Vayelech, Haazinu (Idra Zuta). %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. Zohar Hadash (The New Zohar): additions to the weekly chapters: %0a%3c %0a%3c Beresheet, Noach, Lech Lecha, Vayera, Vayetze, Vayeshev, Bashalach, Yitro, %0a%3c Terumah, Ki Titze, Tzav, Acharey, BaHar, Naso, Chukat, Balak, Matot, VeEtchanen, %0a%3c Ki Titze, Ki Tavo. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. Additional books in The Book of Zohar that are not a direct commentary %0a%3c on the Torah: %0a%3c %0a%3c Idra Raba, Idra Zuta, Safra de Tzniuta, Raza de Razin, Tosefta, Raya Mi'emna, %0a%3c Ashmatot, Sitrey Torah, Sitrey Otiot, and Tikuney Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Midrash HaNe'elam (The Commentary on the Writings): Song of Songs, Ruth, %0a%3c Eicha (Lamentations)— and on the Torah (Pentateuch). %0a%3c %0a%3c Baal HaSulam wrote the commentary on the portions of The Zohar that %0a%3c are known to us. His main commentaries in the "Introduction to the Book of %0a%3c Zohar" and the chapter "Beresheet" are expressed in terms of man's spiritual %0a%3c work. The most valuable articles of The Zohar for the science of Kabbalah are %0a%3c Idra Raba, Idra Zuta, and Safra de Tzniuta. All of them are expressed in the %0a%3c language of Kabbalah. Besides these articles, the rest of The Zohar is written in %0a%3c the language of Midrash. %0a%3c %0a%3c In its original form, The Book of Zohar— written by Rabbi Aba sixteen centuries %0a%3c ago— was not divided into weekly chapters. Its volume was several times larger %0a%3c than the text that reached us; it expounded not only the Torah, but also twenty- %0a%3c four other books of the Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings). %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides The Book of Zohar itself, Rabbi Shimon's book of Tikkunim (correc- %0a%3c tions) had reached us, as well. It comprises seventy commentaries on the first %0a%3c word of the Torah, Beresheet (in the beginning), since it includes everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c This book offers a semantic translation of The Zohar itself, Rabbi Yehuda %0a%3c Ashlag's The Sulam commentary, and my own explanations. The book also %0a%3c contains the first part of The Book of Zohar— Hakdamat Sefer HaZohar (Introduction %0a%3c of The Book of Zohar). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c At the beginning of the text, the semantic translation is given in bold script. %0a%3c The Sulam commentary and my explanations are in regular script or italics %0a%3c because it turned out to be extremely difficult to separate my explanations %0a%3c from Rabbi Ashlag's holy texts. The numbers at the beginning of the items %0a%3c correspond to the numbers of the items in The Book of Zohar with The Sulam %0a%3c commentary, vol. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the interlacing of texts is the need to explain the meaning %0a%3c of The Zohar in several languages simultaneously: a) the language of Kabbalah %0a%3c (Sefirot, Partzufim, Gematria, and worlds), b) the language of spiritual work %0a%3c (emotions), c) the language of the Torah (narrative), and d) the language of the %0a%3c Talmud (judicial). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to returr %0a%3c the commentary. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar, like the whole of the Torah, speaks exclusively of man %0a%3c (creation) and his relationship with the Creator. The Torah attaches worldly %0a%3c appellations to all of man's inner properties. Thus, the aspiration to the Creator %0a%3c is called "Israel," and the aspiration to selfish reception of pleasures is called %0a%3c lations of the world." However, there is no connection whatsoe\ %0a%3c %0a%3c vs and other nations in our work %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The book contains articles commented upon in the language of Kabbalah, %0a%3c and others commented upon in the language of emotions, which is easier to %0a%3c understand for the beginner. The reader can begin the study of the book with such %0a%3c articles as "Night of the Bride," and "Who rejoices on holidays." Nevertheless, %0a%3c a complete study of The Zohar entails systematic learning of the material. The %0a%3c more accustomed we are to Kabbalah, the more it permeates our hearts, and it %0a%3c can only be mastered by repeatedly reviewing the studied material. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Michael Laitman %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA— Arich Anpin— the Partzuf of Hochma, the central, initial Partzuf in the world %0a%3c of Atzilut, from which all the other Partzuf im originate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aba— Father —the Partzuf of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ima— Mother— the Partzuf of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA—Zeir Anpin— Son (with regard to AVI). %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON— ZA and ~Nukva— Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva, Malchut— a Se/ira (singular for Sefirot) or Partzuf that receives from all %0a%3c the preceding Partzufim (plural for Partzuf). Malchut of the world of Atzilut is the %0a%3c sum of all the creatures, all human souls. For this reason it is called Knesset Israel %0a%3c (The Assembly of Israel). %0a%3c %0a%3c Israel— the property of "bestowal," altruism. This is the property of the Creator, %0a%3c the property of Bina. Israel derives from the Hebrew words Yashar— straight, and %0a%3c El— the Creator. Thus, Israel is the property of aspiring to attain equivalence of %0a%3c form with the Creator. The "nations of the world" are the aspiration to selfish %0a%3c reception of pleasure. Naturally, these two properties are present in everyone, %0a%3c and Kabbalah is the method for the development of the property of Israel within %0a%3c man, with the purpose of attaining the Creator in this life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kli (vessel) egoistic desires and aspirations are not considered a Kli. A Kli is the %0a%3c corrected desires, suitable for reception of Light. These are altruistic desires with %0a%3c a screen that has transformed them from egoism into altruism. %0a%3c %0a%3c The human heart that receives all sensations is called the Kli (vessel) of %0a%3c reception of sensations. The spiritual vessel, the only vessel that The Zohar speaks %0a%3c of, is the desire to bestow upon the Creator: to hand over all of man's desires to %0a%3c the Creator, as though saying that he agrees with all his heart to relinquish all of %0a%3c himself for His sake. Such a complete and true intention is called "Lishma" (for %0a%3c the Creator's sake). %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CREATOR'S NAMES %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c KETER %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c EKYEhNAIeph-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HOCHMA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YAhN Yod-Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BINA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH with Nikud Elokim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HESED %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c EL=Aleph-Lamed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEVURA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ELOKIM= Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TIFFERET %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH with Nikud of Shvah-Holam-Kamatz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NETZAH and HOD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TZEVAOT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESOD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SHADDAY=Shin-Dalet-Yod or EL=Aleph-Lamed CHAI=Chet-Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MALCHUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ADNNAIeph-Dalet-Nun-Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mittuk (sweetening/mitigation) of a restriction law. Restriction is a ban for %0a%3c Malchut to receive Light. This ban is lifted when Malchut is corrected by the %0a%3c properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Zivug— coupling— is translated as a sexual union between a man and a woman in %0a%3c this world. Since spiritual actions are absolutely detached from the way we would %0a%3c normally perceive them, I have chosen to use the Hebrew term Zivug, as it is more %0a%3c abstractedly perceived by people with no knowledge of Hebrew. This will help %0a%3c prevent confusions based on previously existing conceptions. The spiritual Zivug %0a%3c is an aspiration of the Upper One (ZA— male part) to pass the Light (pleasure) %0a%3c to the lower one (Malchut— female part). In doing so, both desires are completely %0a%3c selfless, as in the example of the guest and the host. %0a%3c %0a%3c PBP— Panirn be Panirn (face to face). This state occurs when a Zachar (male Sefira), %0a%3c or Aba (father), passes Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) to the female Sefira, or %0a%3c Ima (mother), for the subsequent transfer to the children (ZON). The same %0a%3c relationships of ABA (see below) and PBP also transpire between their children, %0a%3c ZON (ZA and Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c ABA - Achor be Achor, back to back (pronounced Ach be Ach). If Partzuf Aba %0a%3c (Hochma) has Ohr Hochma, but is unwilling to pass it on to Partzuf Ima (Bina), %0a%3c and if Ima also does not want to receive it, such a relationship between them is %0a%3c called back to back. The same relationship can exist between ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed— mercy, compassion, altruism, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy, %0a%3c compassion, and altruism). It appears only within a Kli (desire) that wishes to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c give selflessly and be similar to the Creator. This is the property of the Sefira or %0a%3c Partzuf of Bina. Bina of the world of AK (Adam Kadmon) is called SAG. Bina of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut is called Ima, the Supernal Mother, YESHSL/T, and AVI. %0a%3c The Light of Bina is the pleasure of being similar to the Creator's properties; %0a%3c hence, this Light (sensation) is the most reliable protection from the impure %0a%3c forces. And the Kli that possesses the properties of Bina is unable to transgress, %0a%3c as its desire is solely to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c KHB— Keter-Hochma-Bina (pronounced Kahab). These are the first three Sefirot %0a%3c that form the Rosh (head) of the Partzuf. The Rosh decides how much pleasure %0a%3c the Partzuf can accept not for its own sake but for the sake of the Creator. This %0a%3c Light descends from the Rosh to the Guf (body). %0a%3c %0a%3c HBD— Hochma-Bina-Daat (pronounced Habad). This is the same as Keter-Hochma- %0a%3c Bina (the Rosh of the Partzuf). Sefira Daat is not a Sefira, but the request (also %0a%3c known as MAN) of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva). Daat is the appeal of ZON to %0a%3c Bina regarding their desire to receive Ohr Hochma from her. This prayer of ZON %0a%3c is called MAN, for it ascends to Bina and evokes in Bina (Ima— their mother) the %0a%3c desire to bestow upon her children— ZON. MAN in Bina is called Sefira Daat. %0a%3c This is not a Sefira like the other ten Sefirot; it is rather a request. However, to %0a%3c stress this state, we use the name HBD instead of KHB. %0a%3c %0a%3c HQT— Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet (pronounced Hagat). These are the Sefirot of the Guf %0a%3c (body), similar to the Sefirot of the Rosh: Hesed is tantamount to Keter, Gevura is %0a%3c tantamount to Hochma, and Tifferet is tantamount to Bina. They are called GE %0a%3c (see below) of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c NHYM— Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut (pronounced Nekim). These Sefirot receive %0a%3c from the Sefirot HGT (GE). Since they receive and have the will to receive, they %0a%3c are called AHP of the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c QE— Galgalta-Eynaim (skull and eyes). Sefirot Keter-Hochma-and GAR of Bina. %0a%3c These Sefirot do not have the will to receive and wish only to bestow. Hence, %0a%3c they cannot become egoistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c NRN— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama (pronounced Naran). This is the Light that fills the %0a%3c small Partzuf. Katnut (small state) is when the Partzuf has the strength (a screen) %0a%3c only to bestow, but is unable to receive for the Creator's sake, despite its desire %0a%3c to do so. In this case, the Partzuf has only Ohr Hassadim (Light of Mercy), but %0a%3c not Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom). This is why it is considered a small Partzuf, %0a%3c without strength and reason, similar to a child in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP— Awzen-Hotem-Peh (ear-nose-mouth), pronounced Ahap. These are Sefirot %0a%3c ZAT of Bina-ZA-Malchut, which possess a will to receive. Therefore, in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 24 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c absence of a proper screen (resistance to that desire), they become egoistic. %0a%3c A Partzuf without a screen on its AHP is called Katan (small) and its state is %0a%3c called Katnut (smallness, incompleteness). It is like a child in our world, as this %0a%3c Partzuf, too, has no strength (screen), and can therefore have only Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c without Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c Qadlut— big state. A Partzuf with a screen (strength to resist its egoistic nature) %0a%3c to not only refrain from receiving for its own sake, but to receive not for its own %0a%3c sake (as in the example of the guest and the host. In this case, the Partzuf fills all %0a%3c of its desires (all ten Sefirot) with the Lights of Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c First Big State— Gadlut Aleph, the attainment of the Light of Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c Second Big State— Gadlut Bet, the attainment of the Light of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma— Light of Wisdom. This Light fills the Kelim (vessels/ desires) of %0a%3c reception. It comes only if there is a screen on altruistic reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ateret Yesod— literarily "foreskin," the place of union between Israel and the %0a%3c Creator. After the second restriction, it is forbidden to make a Zivug (spiritual %0a%3c coupling) on Malchut herself due to the absence of the screen. However, a %0a%3c Zivug can be made on the properties that Malchut received from ZA, called %0a%3c Ateret Yesod. Just as the desires of Malchut herself are cut off, the foreskin is %0a%3c circumcised, and the desires that remain within her are those received from %0a%3c ZA, called Ateret Yesod. On these desires, Malchut can make a Zivug with ZA, %0a%3c and receive the Light of Hochma. Naturally, this is not the same Light of %0a%3c Hochma that Malchut would receive if she were able to make a Zivug on her %0a%3c desires, that is, on herself, on her own properties, called "the central point of %0a%3c creation," the truly egoistic desires. Malchut will be able to do that only after %0a%3c 6,000 years, at the end of correction. But before that happens, these desires %0a%3c are called the mark of union with the Creator, since a Zivug on Ateret Yesod %0a%3c brings her closer to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ateret Yesod 1 is also Malchut de Malchut that remains after the circumcision, %0a%3c the removal of the Orla (foreskin). This is the corrected part of Malchut, her %0a%3c unification with Sefira Yesod, upon which a Zivug can be made while still during %0a%3c the 6,000 years, thus bringing Malchut to the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c NRNHY— Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama-Haya-Yechida (pronounced Naranhay). This %0a%3c Light fills the big Partzuf, consisting of GE and AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr (Light)— pleasure, the sensation of the Creator. Ohr should always be inter- %0a%3c preted as the same concept, for although the term is used in general, all of its %0a%3c synonyms are implied! %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kli (vessel)— desire, creature. Like Ohr, the word Kli is used in general, but all of %0a%3c its synonyms are implied! %0a%3c %0a%3c Qematria— numerical value of a letter, or a combination of letters and words. %0a%3c This is a special way of recording spiritual information. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa— firmament, the division between the world of Atzilut and the worlds %0a%3c BYA. The Parsa divides the ten Sefirot into two parts: the altruistic Kelim of %0a%3c bestowal (GAR, KHB, and GE) and the Kelim of reception (ZON or Bina-ZA- %0a%3c Malchut), for Bina deliberately fell into ZA (AHP) with the purpose of correcting %0a%3c him. Malchut, which ascends above Bina and stands below Hochma, is called %0a%3c Parsa or "firmament," and separates GE from AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT, ZAK— the seven Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Net^ah, Hod, Yesod, Malchut %0a%3c (HGTNHYM). %0a%3c %0a%3c VAT, VAK— the six Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod (HGT NHY, %0a%3c pronounced Hagat Nehy). %0a%3c %0a%3c De - the preposition 'of in a possessive meaning. For example, Malchut de %0a%3c Atzilut means Malchut of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c English translation— Whenever it says so in parenthesis, this refers to the %0a%3c books of the Torah (Pentateuch), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings/ %0a%3c Hagiographa), published by Mosad HaRav Kook, in Hebrew with English %0a%3c translation. For example, (Yeshayahu, 11:9; English translation p. XXX, 9) means %0a%3c that if you open page XXX in the book of Prophets, what you are looking for %0a%3c will be in sentence number nine. When the original source is indicated, it is %0a%3c recommended to refer to it there and then to read at least the passage that the %0a%3c quoted saying is ascribed to. This will help you to see even more clearly that the %0a%3c Torah, using an allegorical, figurative language, speaks only of the spiritual world %0a%3c and man's ascension to it, and not at all about history or about our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Garments— attributes, desires, Kelim. Generally, the garments in question are %0a%3c those that Malchut receives from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Huppah—a wedding baldachin, a canopy under which a marriage ceremony %0a%3c takes place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nartik— the covering of ZA; same as the Huppah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Adornments— the Light of Hassadim, Light of Bina, which she passes into %0a%3c Malchut. This corrects Malchut, and enables her to receive the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in the Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Orla— foreskin on the Sefira Yesod, the place of the Zivug between ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c The Orla must be removed, for during the 6,000 years, it is impossible to make %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a Zivug (intention) on Malchut herself and receive for the Creator's sake. Only a %0a%3c Zivug on the union of Malchut with ZA can be made. This is called Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c the part of the Sefira Yesod that remains after the cutting off of the Orla. Orla is %0a%3c also Malchut de Malchut, or the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ima— Mother— Bina with regard to Malchut, who is the daughter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Daughter— Malchut with regard to Bina, mother. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kodesh ha Kodas him— Holy of Holies— the Light of GAR— Neshama-Ha^a-Yechida. %0a%3c Question— the sensation of lack of the Light of Hochma in Malchut. %0a%3c Sela— rock or truth. The name of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shechina— Divinity— the sensation (appearance, vision) of the Creator to those %0a%3c who attain Him. Malchut in the state of reception of the Light (the Creator) is %0a%3c called Shechina. The sensation of the Creator, the place where one experiences %0a%3c the Creator is called Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Techum— zone— the distance beyond the bounds of which one is forbidden to %0a%3c go on Shabbat (the Sabbath). Techum Shahhat constitutes the maximal distance %0a%3c within which one can move about during Sabbath. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sigim— dross— impure desires that exist within pure desires. Man's work is to %0a%3c separate the two, and to gradually correct the Sigim. The term Sigim comes from %0a%3c SAG, for they appeared as a result of the breaking of the Kelim of the world of %0a%3c Nelcudim, which refer to the system of the Partzufim of Partzuf SAG. The term %0a%3c Sigim found its way from Kabbalah into spoken Hebrew. %0a%3c %0a%3c SHACH-Shin-Cha/-300 + 20 = 320 fragments of the broken vessel. %0a%3c %0a%3c RAPACH-Reish-Peh-Chet-200 + 80 + 8 = 288 fragments of the broken vessel, %0a%3c which one can and must be corrected during the 6,000 years, by climbing the %0a%3c 6,000 steps of the spiritual ladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lev ha Even— Stony Heart— Lev = Lamed-Bet = 30 + 2 = 32 fragments into which %0a%3c Malchut had broken. These fragments of Malchut cannot be corrected and made %0a%3c altruistic; one can only refrain from using these desires. Lev ha Even is corrected %0a%3c only after the 6,000 years, that is, after the Creator Himself corrects the 288 %0a%3c fragments within man. It becomes completely altruistic and receives the name %0a%3c Lev Basar (heart of flesh). %0a%3c %0a%3c Lo Lis hma— not for the sake of the Creator. Since nothing exists in creation but %0a%3c the Creator and man, if something is not done "for the sake of the Creator," it is %0a%3c done "for one's own sake." Thus, Lo Lishma denotes man's egoistic intention. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c List of Abbreviations and Explanations %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lishma— for the Creator's sake. Man's selfless intention to act only to please %0a%3c and bring joy to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Four angels that participate in the creation of man— the four basic properties %0a%3c of nature: mercy— Hesed, justice— Tzedek, truth— Emet, and peace— Shalom. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eretz Israel— Land of Israel— Yetzira of this world. Yerushalaim (Jerusalem) is %0a%3c Ateret Yesod in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ORIGINAL NAMES AND THEIR %0a%3c EQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0a%3c ENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aaron - Aaron %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leah - Leah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Amon — Amnion %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lilit - Lilith %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ana'el — Anahel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c iVfarharnfM — \4anniel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Anafiel — Anafiel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A/fatat — A/fptatrnn %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ariel — Ariel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Micha - Micah %0a%3c %0a%3c A.T 11.V-1.1U 1*1 IV Lil L %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham — Abraham %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Moav - Moab %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rat Snpva — Ratnsnena %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A.T IVlOllVv 1V1 V / JV/O %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu - Benaiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nachum - Nahum %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Betzalel - Betzalel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Navuchadnetzar - Nebuchadnezzar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bil'am - Balaam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nechemia - Nehemiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chagai - Haggai %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Noach - Noah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chava - Eve %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ovadia - Obadiah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eden - Eden %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Petachia - Petahyah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eicha - Eichah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pinchas - Pinchas %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Elisha - Elisha %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pisgania - Pesagniyah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eliyahu - Elijah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rahel - Rachel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Esav - Esau %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rivka - Rebecca %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ester - Esther %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rut - Ruth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ezra - Ezra %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sandalphon - Sandalphon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gavri'el - Gabriel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shet - Seth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gazaria - Gazardiel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shimon - Simeon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hanoch - Eunuch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shlomo - Solomon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Havakuk - Habakkuk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shmuel - Samuel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lyov - Job %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tamar - Tamar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Korach - Korach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzefania - Zephaniah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzur - Tyre %0a%3c Yaakov - Jacob %0a%3c Yehoyada - Jehoiada %0a%3c Yechezkel - Ezekiel %0a%3c Yehoshua - Joshua %0a%3c Yehudah - Judah %0a%3c Yerushalaim - Jerusalem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yeshayahu - Isaiah %0a%3c Yirmiyahu - Jeremiah %0a%3c Yishmael - Ishmael %0a%3c Yitzchak - Isaac %0a%3c Yosef - Joseph %0a%3c Zachariah - Zechariah %0a%3c Zvuliel - Zebuliel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ORIGINAL TITLES AND THEIR %0a%3c EQUIVALENTS ACCEPTED IN THE %0a%3c ENGLISH TRANSLATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beresheet - Genesis %0a%3c %0a%3c Shemot - Exodus %0a%3c %0a%3c Vayikra - Leviticus %0a%3c %0a%3c Bamidbar - Numbers %0a%3c %0a%3c Devarim - Deuteronomy %0a%3c %0a%3c Kohelet - Ecclesiastes %0a%3c %0a%3c Shmuel 1 and 2 - Samuel 1 and 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c Melachim 1 and 2 - Kings 1 and 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c Divrey HaYamim - Chronicles %0a%3c %0a%3c Mishley - Proverbs %0a%3c %0a%3c Tehilim - Psalms %0a%3c %0a%3c Shir HaShirim - Song of Songs %0a%3c %0a%3c Shoftim - Judges %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c An Example of the Original %0a%3c Text of The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c |md .D*ninn pa riittwa ,a*ro nnns rppm *ai (8 %0a%3c ,njeie> n*8i ruenff n*8i paa now 8i %0a%3c cp8 ,mni pDio na n*8 D*mnn pa \i*8i ruffw no %0a%3c in^n na n*8 nnm hd .*ami pi na n*8 b8i^* noas %0a%3c pinoi »omn fpses ia>br\ na n*8 ^kiip* noaa ep8 pbj %0a%3c %0a%3c p*S8 ,"13181 NnjJl^D ,83m D*p t ?8 f)18.8ni»D ^30 rb %0a%3c %0a%3c .rh wih) burner* rsoioh xmoh pa*n iD^n %0a%3c %0a%3c p53 ,8in8 8JDT 1318 *8D8 ,8in8 83DT 1318 inabl (3 %0a%3c %0a%3c ,^dh pa*8i .mans?

Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, "It is written, as a rose among thorns." That a rose is %0a%3c the Assembly of Israel. Because there is a rose and there is a rose, just as a rose %0a%3c among thorns is tinged with red and white, the Assembly of Israel consists of %0a%3c judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel %0a%3c is surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of mercy. However, Elokim, %0a%3c that is here, thought to bring out the thirteen words that surround the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel and guard it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Afterwards, this is mentioned another time. The reason it is mentioned %0a%3c another time is to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround the rose. And %0a%3c these five stand for salvation. These are also the five gates. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of this secret, "I will raise the cup of salvation, it is the cup %0a%3c of blessing." The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, and no more, just %0a%3c as a rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this %0a%3c rose is the cup of blessing. From the second to the third mention of the name %0a%3c Elokim, there are five words. From here on, the Light was created and concealed, %0a%3c enclosed within that covenant, and entered the rose and fructified it. And this is %0a%3c referred to as a fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed thereof. And this seed truly %0a%3c exists in the letter of the covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. And just as the form of the covenant is sown in forty-two conceptions from %0a%3c that seed, so is the legislative, special name of creation sown. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. In the beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, the flower buds appeared on the %0a%3c earth. "The flower buds" refer to the act of creation. They appeared on the %0a%3c earth when, on the third day, as it is said, "And the earth shall pullulate." %0a%3c That was when they appeared on the earth. The time of singing has come, and %0a%3c this is the fourth day, when there was a reduction from the Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c The voice of the turtle dove refers to the fifth day, where it is written, "Let the %0a%3c waters swarm," so as to produce offspring. "It is heard" refers to the sixth day, %0a%3c where it is written, "Let us stand and create man," and there it is said, "We %0a%3c will do and we will hear." "In our land" refers to the day of Shabbat, which %0a%3c represents the Land of Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Another meaning is that these flower buds are the Patriarchs who entered the %0a%3c thoughts of the future world, and there they are concealed. They emerged from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 The translation in the book is semantic and not literal %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c there in concealment, and concealed themselves in the true prophets. Yosef was %0a%3c born and they concealed themselves in him. When Yosef entered the Holy Land %0a%3c and founded them there, they appeared in the land (earth) and were revealed %0a%3c there. When are they seen? When a rainbow is seen in the world. It is when the %0a%3c rainbow is seen that they are revealed. As the time of pruning has come. The %0a%3c time has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked %0a%3c saved? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not %0a%3c be seen, they would not have remained in the world, and the world would not %0a%3c be able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. Who animates the world and causes the Fathers to appear? It is the voice of %0a%3c the children, who study the Torah, meaning that these children of the world %0a%3c save the world. In deference to them, "We will make you pendants of gold." %0a%3c Those are the children, children of the world, as is it said, "You shall make two %0a%3c Cherubs of gold." %0a%3c %0a%3c 7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes above and see who %0a%3c has created this." Raise your eyes. To what place? To the place where all eyes %0a%3c depend on Him. And who is He? He is one who opens eyes. And you will know %0a%3c this. It is the concealed Atik, wherein lies the question, who has created this. %0a%3c And who is He? MI = who. He is called from the edge of Divine Heaven, where %0a%3c everything belongs to Him. As there is a question, He is along a concealed path, %0a%3c and does not reveal Himself. He is called MI, as there is no question Above, this %0a%3c edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8. And there is another below, called MA. What is between this and that? The %0a%3c first one, called MI, is concealed. There is a question in him, because man asks, %0a%3c searches and looks, and beholds from degree to degree until the end of all the %0a%3c degrees. And after he arrives there, he is asked: MA? (What?). What have you %0a%3c learned? What have you seen? What have you investigated, since everything is %0a%3c still concealed, just as it was before. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9. It is written of this secret, "Who can I point out to you? Who can I compare %0a%3c you to?" After all, the Temple was destroyed, and a voice came forth and said, %0a%3c "What can I point out to you, and what can I compare you to?" The word MA = %0a%3c what, testimony, each day and the day of testimony to you from the days of past, %0a%3c as it is written: "I call to witness Heaven and earth," which is like unto you. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the same type, "I adorned you with holy ornaments," made %0a%3c you ruler over the world, as it is written: "Is this the city that was called the %0a%3c quintessence of beauty?" and so forth. I have called you, "Jerusalem, a city built %0a%3c by me." "What could be compared to you?" Just as you sit, so he is like Above, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c just as now the holy nation does not enter into you to perform holy work, so %0a%3c I swear to you that I will not enter Above until I dwell down below. This is %0a%3c your consolation, as this degree is equal to you in all things. And now that I %0a%3c am here, "Your misery is great, like the sea." And if you claim that there is no %0a%3c existence or remedy for you, then MI (who) shall heal you? It shall be precisely %0a%3c that concealed Supernal Degree, which animates all things; it shall heal you, %0a%3c and exist within you. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10. MI is the upper edge of Heaven, MA is the lower edge of Heaven. This was %0a%3c inherited by Yaakov, that he shines from edge to edge, from the first edge, which %0a%3c is MI, until the last edge, which is MA, for he stands in the middle. Therefore, %0a%3c who has created this? %0a%3c %0a%3c 11. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, my son, stop talking and reveal to us the supernal %0a%3c secret, which the people of the world know nothing of. Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon wept and said: One minute. Rabbi Shimon said: Elazar, what %0a%3c is ELEH (these)? If you say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, have they not %0a%3c always been seen? However, MA (what) were created, as it is said, by the word of %0a%3c the Creator were the Heavens made. If it is about concealed things, then it is not %0a%3c written ELEH, because they are revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12. But this secret was never revealed, until one day when I was at the seashore, %0a%3c Eliyahu came and told me: "Rabbi, do you know what this is, WHO HAS %0a%3c CREATED THIS?" I told him: "These are the Heavens and their hosts, the %0a%3c works of the Creator, that man can look at them and bless them, as is written, %0a%3c 'When I behold Your Heavens, the work of Your hands, our Master, how glorious %0a%3c Your name is throughout all the earth'!" %0a%3c %0a%3c 13. He told me: "Rabbi, there was one thing concealed before the Creator, %0a%3c which He revealed to the Supernal Assembly, and it is this. When the concealed %0a%3c of all the concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made one single point, %0a%3c and this point ascended and became a Thought. With it, He drew all the forms %0a%3c and with it engraved all the images." %0a%3c %0a%3c 14. He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed %0a%3c image of the holy of holies. A profound structure emerged from the depth of %0a%3c that thought, and it is called MI - who, which is the inception of the structure %0a%3c both standing and not standing, which is hidden deep inside the name. It is not %0a%3c called, but only MI - who. He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this %0a%3c name, so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment and created ELEH, %0a%3c and ELEH ascended in name. These letters combined with these, and the name %0a%3c Elokim was completed. And until He created ELEH - this, Elokim did not ascend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c An Example of the Original Text of The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 39 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to form the name Elokim. And these sinned in worshipping the golden calf. Of %0a%3c this secret it is said, ELEH is your Lord, Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15. Just as the letters MI joined the letters ELEH, so does this name remain %0a%3c forever united, and on this secret stands the world. Eliyahu then flew away, and %0a%3c I could not see him. It is from him that I knew this, which stands on the secret, %0a%3c and its explanation. Rabbi Elazar has come, and all the disciples, too, and they %0a%3c bowed down before him, wept and said, if we had (not) come into this world but %0a%3c only to hear this secret, it would have been enough. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16. Rabbi Shimon said, "Onto these Heavens and their hosts were created in %0a%3c MA, as it is said, 'When I behold the Heavens, the works of Your hands,' and it %0a%3c is said, 'MA, how glorious Your name is throughout all the earth, which You set %0a%3c Above the Heavens, it ascends in name.' That is why it created Light for Light, %0a%3c clothed this into this, and elevated in the Supernal Name, this the Creator %0a%3c created in the beginning. This is the Supernal Creator, for MA is not such and %0a%3c was not created." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Rabbi Hizkiyah opened (began): "It is said, as a rose among thorns" (Shir %0a%3c HaShirim, 2:2). He asks, "What does a rose represent?" He answers, "It is the %0a%3c Assembly of Israel, meaning Malchut. For there is a rose, and there is a rose. %0a%3c Just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red and white, so does the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel (Malchut) consist of judgment and mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen %0a%3c petals, so the Assembly of Israel consists of thirteen properties of mercy, %0a%3c surrounding it on all sides. After all, Elokim (the name of the Creator that %0a%3c alludes to His attitude towards the lower ones by the force of judgment), as %0a%3c it is said, 'In the beginning, Elokim created' (the first sentence in the Torah), %0a%3c In the beginning (initially) when He thought it, He created thirteen words to %0a%3c surround the Assembly of Israel and to protect it, and here they are: THE, %0a%3c HEAVEN, ANDTHE, EARTH, ANDTHE EARTH, WAS, EMPTY, AND- %0a%3c CHAOTIC, ANDTHE DARKNESS, OVER, THE FACE, OF THE ABYSS, %0a%3c ANDTHE SPIRIT, up to the word Elokim" (In Hebrew, "and" is written in %0a%3c conjunction with the word following it. Hence, it is considered as one word). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its object of study, Kabbalah takes the only creation, the only thing that %0a%3c %0a%3c creaks %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As its %0a%3c %0a%3c exists besides the Creator— man's self, or "I," and researches it. This science br %0a%3c down the self into parts, explains the structure and properties of each part, and %0a%3c the purpose of its creation. Kabbalah explains how every part of man's self, called %0a%3c "the soul," can be changed so that one would reach the goal of creation, the state %0a%3c desired by both the Creator and man himself, provided he realizes it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is not a science in the world that can describe, either graphically or %0a%3c nalytically, through use of formulas, our sensations and desires, and how diverse %0a%3c nd multifaceted they are. That is how fickle, unpredictable, and absolutely %0a%3c listinct they are in everyone. This is because our desires surface in our mind %0a%3c nd sensations in a gradual order, in a certain sequence, so we may acknowledge %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is our essence, the only thing that characterizes an indi\ %0a%3c ging, and what remains is merely an external, ar %0a%3c hy it is said that every moment man is born anew. Yet, if thi; %0a%3c )Uid we regard one another, and how should we perceive ourselves? How %0a%3c possibly "stabilize" anything within and outside of us if we are constantly %0a%3c >ing, and all that we perceive is a function of our inner state? %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator is the source of Light (pleasure). Those who draw near Him %0a%3c sense Him as such. Such people, who draw near the Creator and thereby sense %0a%3c Him, are called Kabbalists (from the word Lekabel— to receive the Creator's %0a%3c Light). One can draw near the Creator only through equivalence of desires. %0a%3c ;ator is incorporeal, and can only be sensed with our heart. Naturall 1 %0a%3c leant by "heart" is not the pump that mobilizes blood through our vei %0a%3c ter of man's every sensation. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one cannot sense the Creator with just his heart, but only with %0a%3c small point in it. And to feel this point, man must develop it himself. When %0a%3c one develops and expands this point, the sensation of the Creator, His Light, %0a%3c can enter it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our heart is the sum of our egoistic desires, and the small point within it %0a%3c is part of the spiritual, altruistic desire implanted from Above by the Creator %0a%3c Himself. It is our task to nurture this embryo of a spiritual desire to such an %0a%3c ;nt that it (and not our egoistic nature) will determine all of our aspiratior %0a%3c re time, the egoistic desire of the heart will surrender, contract, ' %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lg born in our world, one is obliged to change his hear %0a%3c egoistic to altruistic, while living in this world. This is the purpose of %0a%3c the reason behind his appearance in this world, and it is the goal of all creation. %0a%3c A complete replacement of egoistic desires with altruistic ones is called "the %0a%3c End of Correction." Every individual and all of humanity must attain it in this %0a%3c world together. Until one achieves this, he will continue to be born into this %0a%3c rid. The Torah and all the prophets speak exclusively of this. The methoc %0a%3c tion is called "Kabbalah." %0a%3c %0a%3c >ne can change his desires only i %0a%3c solute egoist; he can neither ac %0a%3c from the surrounding world— as his surroundings are just like him— nor does he %0a%3c have any link to the spiritual worlds, since such a link is possible only throu£ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 43 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ence, an individual in our world has no chance of transcending %0a%3c ies of this world on his own. That is why we were given the To %0a%3c ost effective part, Kabbalah— to help man acquire the desires of %0a%3c orlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order to create man in remoteness to Himself, so that man would realize %0a%3c his insignificance and would come independently to the desire to ascend, the %0a%3c Creator created all creation as degrees descending from Him. The Creator's %0a%3c Light descended along these degrees, and at the lowest degree, created our world %0a%3c and man in it. Having realized his insignificance and wishing to ascend to the %0a%3c reator, man (to the extent that he wishes to approach the Creator) ascends %0a%3c the same degrees by which his initial descent took place. %0a%3c %0a%3c In all, there are ten degrees, called "ten Sefirot": Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, %0a%3c Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Malchut. Like ten screens or curtains, %0a%3c these ten Sefirot conceal the Creator's Light from us or the Creator Himself %0a%3c (which is the same thing). These ten screens constitute the ten degrees of our %0a%3c remoteness from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, in order to draw near the Creator by one degree, the lowest %0a%3c one above our own properties, we must acquire the properties of that (lowest) %0a%3c degree. This means that our properties become similar to the properties of that %0a%3c degree, rather than remaining inferior to it. To acquire similar properties means %0a%3c to have the same desires. As soon as our desires coincide with the desires of %0a%3c that degree, its concealment fades, and we seemingly exist on it, and only nine %0a%3c degrees separate us from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the last, lowest degree differs from all the others: as soon as one %0a%3c ascends out of our world and onto the first degree, he already begins to see %0a%3c (sense) the Creator. And all the subsequent degrees are degrees of drawing closer %0a%3c to the Creator. Only the very last degree, at which we presently exist, conceals %0a%3c the Creator completely, whereas all of the Higher Degrees only distance Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although we count ten degrees, there are in fact only five of them. This is %0a%3c because six degrees: Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, Netzah, Hod, and Yesod combine into %0a%3c one Sefira, called ZeirAnpin (ZA). ZA itself is sometimes referred to as Tifferet, for %0a%3c this Sefira reflects the common attributes of all of its six Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, there are five degrees of concealment from the Creator down to our %0a%3c world: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut. Every degree is alternatively called %0a%3c Olam (world), from the word Haalamah (concealment). Every degree has its sub- %0a%3c degrees, called Partzufim (plural for Partzuf), and every sub-degree has its own %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 44 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sub-degrees, called Sefirot (plural for Sefira). Thus, in all, 5x5x5 = 125 degrees- %0a%3c Sefirot exist between us and the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Below is a table of the degrees from the Creator down to our world: %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator: an absolutely altruistic desire to create a soul (man) in order %0a%3c to fill it with delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Infinity: the existence of souls in the ultimate, perfect state. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLDS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUFIM %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galaalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 st World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AB %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam Kadmon %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (AK) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( * ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Arirh Annin (AA\ %0a%3c %0a%3c r\\ iv/i i r\\ \vj\\ \ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ?nd Wnrlrl %0a%3c %0a%3c L.

Therefore, when the desire %0a%3c create souls (the will to enjoy) appeared in the Creator, when He wished %0a%3c fill them with the most perfect delight— to sense Him and to delight in His %0a%3c perfection— to make creatures just as He is, His desire was immediately realized. %0a%3c Thus appeared the World of Ein Sof, in which we already exist in our final state. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, we still need to attain this state in our sensations. This is %0a%3c reminiscent of a sleeping person: even though he is sleeping somewhere, he %0a%3c does not understand where he is until he wakes up. However, in order to achieve %0a%3c is perfect state, we must go through a gradual process of transformation of our %0a%3c ner properties (desires), which corresponds to the spiritual ascension fror %0a%3c r world through all the worlds, to the World of Ein Sof. %0a%3c %0a%3c lead us to the final state, the Creator governs us from Above thrc %0a%3c all the worlds. Thus, there is nothing in our world that does not originate in %0a%3c the World of Ein Sof, where the final state of every soul determines the path %0a%3c that it is destined to travel in general and the changes that it has to undergo %0a%3c in particular at every moment (state) of its spiritual advancement towards the %0a%3c World of Infinity. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is no way back: everything that happens is dictated by the necessity to %0a%3c ing every soul to its final state. Only this goal determines the state of our worl %0a%3c ery second, what happens to it in general and to each of us in particular. ' %0a%3c created nothing for naught. Rather, everything serves His purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the will that stems from Above does not exclude our ac %0a%3c articipation in our own advancement. Instead of being slaves that move %0a%3c under the compulsion of a beating stick called suffering, we can turn our path %0a%3c of suffering into the path of Torah— to actively and quickly travel this path %0a%3c from below upwards on our own by realizing that the Creator's purpose is %0a%3c indeed desirable. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is possible via a request for spiritual elevation— raising MAN, a prayer, %0a%3c response, we will receive spiritual strength from Above that will help us %0a%3c our qualities, i.e., to ascend. The entire Torah speaks only of this, and %0a%3c goes further still and provides a detailed explanation of the path itself, %0a%3c if on a map, it depicts what we go through and where (in what state and at %0a%3c :h degree) we are now. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 46 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah studies the structure of the spiritual worlds. The purpose of these %0a%3c worlds is to weaken the Creator's signals (desires) so that we could understand %0a%3c them with our egoism and realize them with our mind. In Hebrew, the word %0a%3c for "world" is Olam (from the word Haalamah— meaning concealment), for %0a%3c these worlds conceal and weaken the Creator's Light to such an extent that %0a%3c we can feel it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Depending on everyone's spiritual qualities, on the degree of one's %0a%3c attainment (complete egoism = our world, partial altruism = spiritual worlds), %0a%3c we perceive the Creator or His Light differently at each of the 125 degrees. These %0a%3c 125 degrees amount to just ten, called "the ten Sefirot between the Creator and %0a%3c us," where every lower Sefira transmits less of the Creator's Light, as perceived %0a%3c by those at that degree. The lower the Sefira, the less of the Creator's Light it lets %0a%3c through to those that are below it. %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c These are the names of the Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, Hesed, Gevura, Tifferet, %0a%3c Netzah, Hod, Yesod, and Makhut. However, six of them are combined into one %0a%3c Sefira, called Zeir Anpin, so in all there are five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut. Also, ZA himself (ZA is usually considered a male Sefira) is %0a%3c sometimes called Tifferet, since Tifferet is his main Sefira, absorbing within itself %0a%3c the properties of all six Sefirot of ZA. Thus, the Creator created only five Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter— the Creator's desire to bestow delight upon us, Malchut; %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma— the pleasure itself, which the Creator wishes to bestow upon us; %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina— passes the pleasure from Hochma to ZA; %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA— accepts the pleasure from Bina and passes it to Malchut; %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut— receives the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina consists of two parts: her upper part, called GAR or AVI, is unwilling %0a%3c to receive the Light from Hochma. However, since the Creator wishes to impart %0a%3c this Light to the lower ones, the lower part of Bina, called ZAT or YESHSL7T, %0a%3c receives the Light from Hochma and passes it to ZA. ZA does not want to receive %0a%3c the Light, but Malchut (to the extent of her correction) evokes ZA to receive %0a%3c the Light from Bina and pass it on to her. Hence, we sometimes speak of the %0a%3c general reception of the Light by ZA and Malchut, which are together called %0a%3c ZON (ZA and Nukva). %0a%3c %0a%3c The process is such that Malchut— to the extent that her desires are corrected %0a%3c from egoism to altruism— asks ZA to receive the Light "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c To this extent, ZA requests the Light from Bina. Subsequently, Bina turns to %0a%3c and receives the requested amount of Light from Hochma, then passes it to %0a%3c ZA. Malchut (to the extent of her corrected properties) merges with ZA via %0a%3c equivalence of form (desires), and receives this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter, Hochma, and GAR of Bina do not want to receive the Light, but %0a%3c starting with ZAT of Bina (YESHS L7T), the desire to receive the Light so as to %0a%3c pass it to the lower ones appears in the Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galgalta or Metzah - forehead %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "bestowal" %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Eynaim - eyes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c _.

This desire is to enjoy the Creator's Light or the Creator %0a%3c (which is the same thing) is the essence of Malchut. We are parts of Malchut. %0a%3c However, if we have only egoistic desires, we feel the Creator's Light as pleasures %0a%3c in our world. This is a micro dose of His Light. By correcting our desires %0a%3c (properties), we can ascend the spiritual degrees of the Upper Worlds, and there %0a%3c experience the Creator's true delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the Thought of Creation, Malchut must receive the Light from %0a%3c the four previous Sefirot, and delight in it. Hence, Malchut herself consists of five %0a%3c parts: she receives the Light from the preceding Sefirot in four parts, and senses %0a%3c it in the fifth. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Sefirot that precede Malchut (excluding Malchut) are similar to our %0a%3c sensory organs, and Malchut is like the heart that receives from all organs: brain, %0a%3c sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The heart is Malchut, and the sensory %0a%3c organs are the first nine Sefirot that precede Malchut. All of these parts of Malchut %0a%3c are egoistic— they wish to receive the Light (pleasure) so as to enjoy it. With such %0a%3c properties, Malchut cannot receive more than a micro dose of the Light of our %0a%3c world, sensing the Creator in a manner called "this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if Malchut, i.e., every one of us, were to receive desires (aspirations) %0a%3c from Above to bestow delight upon the Creator to the same extent that we feel %0a%3c the Creator bestowing upon us, with this property (desire), man would ascend %0a%3c spiritually to a degree above our world. He would sense the Creator as spiritual %0a%3c Light, altruistic pleasure and great knowledge, attainment of supernal thoughts %0a%3c and the essence of existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c SCREEN %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut (man) can receive the Light only in anti-egoistic desires. If such desires %0a%3c appear in Malchut as a result of the realization that egoism is her enemy (with %0a%3c the help of Kabbalah), to the extent of her hatred for it, Malchut can repel %0a%3c the egoistic pleasures for the sake of spiritual perfection, i.e., similarity to the %0a%3c Creator in her desire to please Him and act for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ability to repel selfish reception of pleasure is called "a screen," and %0a%3c the repelled pleasure is called "Returning Light," and the pleasure that comes to %0a%3c Malchut is called "Direct Light." It is precisely in the repelled pleasure, meaning %0a%3c in the desire to bestow whole-heartedly, selflessly, that man can sense the %0a%3c Creator's Light and Supreme Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut (man's egoism) has to repel pleasure from the five parts of her %0a%3c egoism, the reflecting screen must also consist of five parts. Hence, it creates five %0a%3c parts of the Returning Light. The five parts in Malchut are called by the names %0a%3c of the Sefirot from which they receive. The five kinds of Direct Light are called %0a%3c NRNHY: Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Haya and Yechida. The Light that emanates %0a%3c from the Creator descends in the following order: %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut reflects the Light (pleasure), she decides to receive it in order to %0a%3c delight the Creator, because He wants Malchut to receive pleasure and feel Him. %0a%3c The reflection of all the incoming pleasure is called Rosh (head). The partial %0a%3c reception of the Light to the extent of one's anti-egoistic powers is called Toch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (interior). The unfulfilled desires (due to the absence of a screen on them) are %0a%3c called So/ (end) (see below diagram). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the structure of the soul (KU, vessel, corrected altruistic desire, Partzuf %0a%3c or spiritual body). We call the parts of the spiritual structure by the names of our %0a%3c physiological body: head, body, and limbs. There are five parts in the Rosh (head): %0a%3c skull— Galgalta, eyes— Eynairn, ears— Awznaim, nose— Hotem, and mouth— Peh. %0a%3c There are five parts in the Guf (body) from the mouth— Peh to the navel— Tabur. In %0a%3c the limbs, there are five parts from the navel to the toes (see below diagram). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c / %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c OhrMakif %0a%3c (Surrounding Light) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c \ %0a%3c %0a%3c OhrYashar * %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE INVERSE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE VESSEL %0a%3c AND THE LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c The more strength Malchut has to oppose egoism, the greater the Light that %0a%3c enters her. However, although one works on the correction of the vessel's coarser %0a%3c part, he receives the Light from his efforts in his subtler desires. In other words, %0a%3c there is an inverse proportion between the vessel and the Light: the coarser the %0a%3c desire (Kli) that is corrected, the greater the Light that enters Malchut (vessel); %0a%3c however, it enters her Upper Kli (desire). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut (i.e., all that exists apart from the Creator) is absolutely %0a%3c egoistic, she can only be corrected by imparting onto herself the properties of %0a%3c Bina, the Creator— bestowal without reception. This is the property of absolute %0a%3c altruism, of selfless bestowal. To receive such a property (desire) is tantamount %0a%3c to ascending from the level of Malchut to the level of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c If all parts of the Kli can %0a%3c receive the Light, then %0a%3c all the outside Light %0a%3c enters the Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut herself is the will to receive pleasure. The ban imposed on the %0a%3c reception of pleasure for oneself is called the First Restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph). %0a%3c Restriction is a ban on the reception of pleasure; however, if the receiver aspires %0a%3c to please the Creator and not himself, he is allowed to receive the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Whether Malchut wants it or not, if she (soul, man) has egoistic desires, the %0a%3c Light will not enter her (be felt within her). Hence, we are utterly unable to feel %0a%3c the spiritual (the Creator). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STATE OF KATNUT (SMALLNESS) %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Malchut is not the only Sefira that cannot receive the Light: from the world %0a%3c of Atzilut and below, Sefirot Bina and ZA cannot receive the Light either. This %0a%3c ban is called the Second Restriction (T?imt?um Bet). In this restriction, Malchut %0a%3c seemingly ascends in her desires to Sefira Bina. Her desires of "reception" %0a%3c dominate three Sefirot: Bina, ZA, and Malchut, as Sefirot Bina and ZA also fall %0a%3c under the rule (desire) of the elevated Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c If a Partzuf has no strength to oppose its egoistic desires of reception in %0a%3c Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut (AHP), its lower part is not entitled to receive the %0a%3c Creator's Light, as it will receive it selfishly, thereby causing great harm to itself. %0a%3c To avoid this, the upper part of the Partzuf— Sefirot Keter and Hochma (GE)— %0a%3c separates from the lower part by Parsa (partition), through which the Light %0a%3c cannot pass downwards. Therefore, as a result of Malchut 's ascent to Bina, each %0a%3c degree was divided into two parts: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter -Galgalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - Eynaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together called Galgalta %0a%3c Eynaim (GE) %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa = elevated Malchut — %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-Hotem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together called AHP %0a%3c (Awzen, Hotem, and Peh) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut restricted the spreading of Light inside the Partzuf, and two parts %0a%3c were formed in her: GE receives the Light, i.e., Sefirot Keter and Hochma receive %0a%3c the Lights Ne/esh and Ruach, while the other part of the Partzuf (Sefirot Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut) is below the Parsa, and therefore does not receive the Light. %0a%3c Their corresponding Lights— Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida— also remain outside %0a%3c of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This degree (Partzuf) is deprived of the Light Nesharna-Haya-Yechida and is left %0a%3c with just the Light Nefesh-Ruach, called "air." This is designated by the entry of %0a%3c the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish). Thus, the word Light %0a%3c (Ohr) turns into air (Avir = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish). This state of the vessel is called %0a%3c Katnut (small state). In other words, the ascent of Malchut to Bina is designated %0a%3c by the entry of the letter Yod into the word Light (Ohr = Aleph-Vav-Reish +Yod = %0a%3c Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish = Avir— air). This means that because of Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina, the Partzuf lost its Light and was left with air. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, the degree or Partzuf is called Katnut (smallness), where %0a%3c Sefirot Keter and Hochma have only the Light Nefesh-Ruach, as Sefirot Bina, ZA and %0a%3c Malchut are below the Parsa, and do not receive the Light. The Parsa prevents %0a%3c the Light from spreading below it. Sefirot Keter-Hochma and Bina-ZA-Malchut are %0a%3c designated by the following letters: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Mem - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Yod - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hey - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Lamed - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LO %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Aleph - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 53 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the reverse order, these letters form the Creator's name Elokirn, where %0a%3c GE = letters Mem + Yod = IM (pronounced as MI), and AHP = letters Aleph + %0a%3c Lamed + Hey = ELEH. Since man attains the Creator from below upwards, the %0a%3c Creator's name ELOKIM is read from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the birth of all the worlds and the descent of the entire Creation to %0a%3c our world, all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA passed %0a%3c into the state of Katnut. Thus, the Light is present in GE, but absent in AHP. %0a%3c AHP of the Upper Degree fell into GE of the lower degree, thus forming the %0a%3c spiritual ladder between the Creator and man in our world, and the lowest part %0a%3c of the last spiritual degree of the world of Assiya fell into a point in man's heart. %0a%3c Consequently, all the intermediate degrees now exist one inside the other: AHP %0a%3c of the Upper Degree is inside GE of the lower one: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CREATOR %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The descent of the Light from the Creator down to man in our world %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE WORLD OF AK %0a%3c , , The head of AA ("unattainable") is considered Infinity %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Atzilut = GE and AHP fell into the world of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ~ B J %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Beria = GE and AHP of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Yetzira = GE and AHP of the world of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c _H %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Assiya = GE and AHP of the world of Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Our world = man's point in the heart, %0a%3c which contains AHP of the world of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The sum of man's desires is referred to as his heart. Since the nature with %0a%3c which we are born is absolute egoism, man does not feel the spiritual point %0a%3c in his heart. However, at some point in one of his reincarnations, man begins %0a%3c to gradually strive towards attainment of the causes of life, its evaluation; he %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c yearns to attain himself, his source, just as you do right now. Man's aspiration %0a%3c to the Creator is precisely this aspiration to attain his origin. Man's discontent %0a%3c in life often helps him in this search, when there's nothing that appeals to him %0a%3c in his surroundings. Such circumstances are sent from Above in order for man %0a%3c to start feeling an empty point in his heart, and to stimulate in him the desire %0a%3c to fulfill it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator manifests as the altruistic property to bestow pleasure without %0a%3c any benefit for Himself. From this, we can understand the property of Sefirot %0a%3c Keter, Hochma, and Bina that share the Creator's property of bestowal. The only %0a%3c Creation is Malchut, the will to receive the Light (pleasure). All of us and our %0a%3c entire world are the lowest part of this egoistic Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STATE OF QADLUT (GREATNESS/ADULTHOOD) %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if one (Malchut) raises MAN, the request for his spiritual ascent, by %0a%3c making efforts to free himself from egoism and by praying to the Creator for %0a%3c help, the Light AB-SAG descends from Above. It comes from the world of AK, %0a%3c brings Malchut altruistic strength and enables her to return from Bina back to %0a%3c her place. In other words, Malchut's ability to refrain from selfish reception of %0a%3c pleasure is complemented with the strength to receive pleasure for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, to receive the Light of Hochma within AHP, for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, AHP, or Sefirot Bina, ZA and Malchut, become reactivated, the %0a%3c Partzuf regains all five Kelim (parts), the letter Yod disappears from the word Avir %0a%3c (air), and it turns to being Ohr (Light). In that state, all five Lights NRNHY fill %0a%3c the Partzuf, the letters MI join the letters ELEH, forming the Creator's name— %0a%3c Elokim. This state is called Gadlut (greatness/ adulthood). %0a%3c %0a%3c ASCENT OF THE LOWER ONE TO THE UPPER ONE %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, the Upper Partzuf establishes contact with %0a%3c the lower one. As a result, the lower Partzuf can ascend to the level of the Upper %0a%3c One. This is the reason for the second restriction: to give the lower ones (man) %0a%3c the opportunity to ascend to the World of Infinity, up to the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order to establish this contact, the Upper Partzuf deliberately diminishes %0a%3c itself, descends to the level of the lower Partzuf, and becomes similar to the lower %0a%3c one in its properties. AHP of the Upper Partzuf willingly falls into GE of the %0a%3c lower one, as though it has no strength to receive the Light, and they become %0a%3c a single whole. This is similar to a scenario when a strong individual joins a %0a%3c society of criminals, imitating their behavior, so that after being admitted into %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their circle and establishing contact with them, he will gradually influence and %0a%3c correct them. %0a%3c %0a%3c How? The Upper Light (the so-called Light of AB-SAG) comes and provides %0a%3c AHP of the Upper Partzuf with the strength to ascend to their GE. And GE of the %0a%3c lower Partzuf ascend together with them: because they were a single whole and %0a%3c equivalent in their properties below, they receive the same strength to ascend. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon receiving the Light of AB-SAG, GE of the lower Partzuf become %0a%3c like Upper One. Therefore, we should not regard the second restriction as %0a%3c negative, but as help from the Upper Partzuf. It descends to the lower Partzuf by %0a%3c corrupting its own properties in order to equalize itself with the lower one, so as %0a%3c to subsequently ascend together with it to its previous level. This way, the lowest %0a%3c degree can ascend not only to the next Higher One, but also to the Highest %0a%3c Degree of the spiritual ladder. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT OF ZON IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLDS BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf YESHSUT is AHP of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, and all that it %0a%3c receives and passes to ZON of the world of Atzilut subsequently descends to the %0a%3c worlds of BYA and then to us. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the small state (Katnut), AHP of YESHSUT falls into ZON. Then %0a%3c YESHSUT receives strength, and by elevating its AHP, it elevates ZON, too. %0a%3c By ascending to YESHSUT, ZON become similar to it and receive the Light %0a%3c at the level of YESHSUT. ZON can never receive the Light of Hochma in their %0a%3c own level; they can only receive the Light of Hassadim, the Light essential to %0a%3c their existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut are called Olam (world), just as our world is also %0a%3c called Olam, for all that ZON de Atzilut receive can be received by man in this %0a%3c world. And vice versa— all that ZON de Atzilut cannot receive is unattainable to %0a%3c man, for we attain only up to the level of ZON, and not higher. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since ZON cannot receive the Light of Hochma in their place, the %0a%3c Creator purposely initiated the second restriction, thereby lowering the Sefirot %0a%3c of AHP of Partzuf YESHSUT down to ZON, so that ZON would be able to %0a%3c ascend to YESHSUT and higher, up to the Highest Degree. Hence, it is said %0a%3c in the Torah (Beresheet BaraK): "In the beginning the Creator created all in %0a%3c judgment (restriction), but after seeing that the world (ZON) cannot exist %0a%3c (receive all of the Light of Hochma prepared for it), added to judgment the %0a%3c property of mercy." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, He elevated Malchut (the restriction of YESHSUT, for %0a%3c Malchut is restricted from receiving Light) to Bina (mercy of YESHSUT). As a %0a%3c result, AHP of YESHSUT fell into ZON and merged with them. However, the %0a%3c world (ZON) still cannot exist in this way. Hence, the Creator added mercy to %0a%3c judgment: He gave YESHSUT the strength to elevate its AHP together with ZON %0a%3c to the degree of YESHSUT. There, ZON receive the Light of YESHSUT and pass %0a%3c it down to all the worlds of BYA and to our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c CORRECTION IN THREE LINES %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the ten Sefirot in turn consists of ten individual sub-Sefirot. Malchut %0a%3c ascends to Bina in each individual Sefira, i.e., to the full height of the ten %0a%3c Sefirot; in each particular Sefira, Malchut moves up from its place to the place %0a%3c of Bina in that Sefira: %0a%3c %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-K %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-H %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-B %0a%3c (M-ZA-|B-H-K)-ZA %0a%3c (M-ZA-I B-H-K)-M %0a%3c %0a%3c The sign | signifies a particular Parsa in a Sefira, the restriction imposed on %0a%3c the spreading of Light. GE that remain in each Sefira above the Parsa are called %0a%3c the "right line," for there is Light in them. Malchut that ascends to Bina in each %0a%3c Sefira creates the "left line" with her restriction on the reception of Light. A %0a%3c Zivug made on the elevated Malchut (only on the free, unrestricted Kelim KHB) %0a%3c allows the Light of Hassadim to shine in GE, and this reception of the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim in GE is called the "middle line." %0a%3c %0a%3c Now let us clarify what is written in The Zohar: There are ten Sefirot: Keter %0a%3c (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Hesed (H), Gevura (G), Tifferet (T), Netzah (N), Hod %0a%3c (H), Yesod (Y), and Malchut (M). However, there are actually only five of them: %0a%3c Keter (K), Hochma (H), Bina (B), Tifferet (T), and Malchut (M). This is because %0a%3c Tifferet (alternatively called Zeir An£>in— ZA) consists of six Sefirot, from Hesed to %0a%3c Yesod. Five Sefirot KHB-ZA-M created five Partzufim in each world. In the world %0a%3c of Atzilut, these Partzufim are Arich Anpin (AA), Aba ve Ima (AVI), and Zeir An£>in %0a%3c and Nukva (ZON). Keter is called AA; correspondingly, Hochma and Bina are %0a%3c called AVI; and ZA (Tifferet) and Malchut are called ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The essence of the seven days of creation lies in Partzufim ZA and Nukva of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut, which consist of seven Sefirot: HGT-NHYM. And from the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 57 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c description of creation it transpires how AVI (Hochma and Bina) beget ZON (all %0a%3c of creation, including us) and elevate them to their final state during the 6,000 %0a%3c years. This is what The Book of Zohar tells us. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Hizkiyah began his explanation of Nukva of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c by clarifying the birth of ZON from Ima (Bina), called Elokim. That is why he %0a%3c began his explanation with a rose, Nukva of ZA. At the utmost completion of %0a%3c its development, Nukva of ZA is called Knesset Israel, the Assembly of Israel. %0a%3c For Nukva consists of all the souls called Israel; hence, it is said that a rose is %0a%3c Knesset Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two states in a rose (Malchut). The lowest, initial, small state %0a%3c (Katnut) is when Malchut consists only of Sefira Keter filled with the Light %0a%3c Nefesh, while her other nine Sefirot are those that fell from the world of Atzilut %0a%3c to the world of Beria. The other state of Nukva is mature, big, complete %0a%3c (Gadlut), when her nine Sefirot ascend from the world of Beria back to the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, and complete the full ten Sefirot of her Partzuf. Then, being %0a%3c equal to her husband, Malchut ascends together with him to AVI and clothes %0a%3c them, i.e., receives their Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The clothing of the lower, outer Partzuf onto the Upper, Inner One means %0a%3c that the lower Partzuf attains a part of the Upper One, ascends to a Higher %0a%3c spiritual level, and becomes in some way similar to the Upper Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c In that state, ZA is called Israel, from the letters LI (to me) and ROSH %0a%3c (head), which signifies the state of Gadlut, while Nukva is called "the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel," for she accumulates all of the Light of her husband, ZA, and passes it %0a%3c to the lower ones— the souls in the worlds BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva 's state of Katnut is called "a rose among thorns," for nine of her lower %0a%3c Sefirot in the Katnut state fell under the Parsa of the world of Atzilut, thereby %0a%3c losing the Light of the world of Atzilut, and becoming as dry as thorns. And in %0a%3c her Gadlut state, Nukva is simply called "a rose" or "the Assembly of Israel." This %0a%3c is why it is written, "there is a rose, and there is a rose." %0a%3c %0a%3c The color red designates the rose's connection with the outer, impure forces, %0a%3c which, because of this connection, can suck the strength (Light) from it. This is %0a%3c because nine of her Sefirot are in exile below the world of Atzilut, in the world %0a%3c of Beria, which may already contain impure forces. And the rose also has a color %0a%3c white in its Sefira Keter, for her Sefira Keter is in the world of Atzilut, above the %0a%3c Parsa, where there is no contact with the lower, impure forces. In other words, %0a%3c there are two opposite states: perfection and its absence, Light and darkness. %0a%3c They are felt by him who merits it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that just as a rose among thorns is tinged with red %0a%3c and white, so does the Assembly of Israel consist of judgment and mercy. This %0a%3c shows that in Gadlut, when Malchut is called Knesset Israel, even though she %0a%3c ascended to Bina and clothed her, she still retains the property of judgment, of %0a%3c restriction— an attitude that's tough and just, rather than compassionate. This %0a%3c is so because she needs a screen (a force of resistance to her egoistic desires), %0a%3c which, if available, enables Malchut to receive the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The law, judgment, or restriction does not allow for the reception of Light %0a%3c in egoistic desires. The screen, the aspiration to oppose one's egoistic desires, %0a%3c repels the Upper Light (pleasure) back to its source, the Creator. The Light that %0a%3c man sends back is called "Returning Light" or the "Light of Judgment." To %0a%3c the extent of the intensity of the reflective force (i.e., the force of resistance to %0a%3c one's will to receive), man is allowed to receive the ten Sefirot of the Upper Light %0a%3c (called the Direct Light or the Light of Mercy) for the Creator's sake, in precisely %0a%3c these altruistic desires. And that is why, even in its complete state, the Assembly %0a%3c of Israel consists of judgment and mercy, which corresponds to the red and %0a%3c white colors of a rose among thorns. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is the pool made by King Shlomo (Solomon). It is built on twelve %0a%3c bulls, for the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut that fell to the world of Beria were %0a%3c corrected there from twelve heads of bulls. One of their Sefirot, Keter, which %0a%3c remained in the world of Atzilut, is called the "pool" that is built on these bulls. %0a%3c Together, they are called thirteen rose petals. (The reason why the ten Sefirot of %0a%3c Malchut are divided by ten-Hassadim or thirteen-Hochma will be clarified later). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of a complete Nukva is called Hochma, as it contains the Light of %0a%3c Wisdom, and originates from the thirteen names called "the thirteen attributes %0a%3c of mercy." However, the main thing that Rabbi Hizkiyah wants to tell us is that %0a%3c a rose among thorns is above the Assembly of Israel, because, as is well known, %0a%3c all that is present in Nukva's complete state must exist in her small state as well, %0a%3c albeit in diminished similarity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that the properties of white and red in the small state %0a%3c correspond to the properties of mercy and judgment in the big state. And the %0a%3c thirteen petals of the small state, when corrected, create in Nukva the thirteen %0a%3c attributes of mercy in her big state. Later on, we will see how these thirteen %0a%3c attributes of Malchut of the world of Atzilut change her in both the small and %0a%3c big states. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written that, in the process of creation, "in the beginning Elokim (Bina %0a%3c de Atzilut) created" Nukva of ZA with thirteen words: ET, SHAMAJM, VE'ET, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ARETZ, VEARETZ, HAITA, TOHL7, VABOHU, VECHOSHECH, AL, PNEI, %0a%3c TEHOM, VERLACH (from the word Elokim to the word Elokim). And these %0a%3c thirteen words signify the thirteen petals of a rose among thorns (her small %0a%3c state), like the pool built by the King Shlomo, which stands on thirteen (twelve) %0a%3c bulls (nine lower Sefirot of Malchut without Light, as they are in the world of %0a%3c Beria, below the Parsa of the world of Atzilut). These words are the preparation %0a%3c for the purification and correction of the Assembly of Israel in order to receive %0a%3c the thirteen attributes of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c These thirteen attributes of mercy (the Light of a complete Nukva) surround %0a%3c her and shine upon her from all sides, and guard her from the touch of foreign %0a%3c (egoistic) desires. After all, until she is filled with all the Light of Hochma in her %0a%3c complete, big state, there's a potential for foreign, egoistic desires to cling to and %0a%3c feed off her. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Afterwards, the name Elokim is mentioned once more, "Elokim soars." %0a%3c Why is it mentioned in this sense? So as to bring out the five rigid leaves that %0a%3c surround the rose, which are called "salvation." And these are the five gates. %0a%3c And it is said of this secret, I will raise the "cup of salvation" (Psalms, 116:13). %0a%3c It is the cup of blessing. The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, just as a %0a%3c rose rests on five rigid leaves that correspond to the five fingers. And this rose is %0a%3c the cup of blessing, from the second to the third mention of the name Elokim %0a%3c (Beresheet, 1:2-3), there are five words: "soars," "over," "the surface," "of the %0a%3c waters," "and said"— in all, five words parallel the five leaves. And further, %0a%3c "The Creator said, 'Let there be Light'"— this Light was created. However, it %0a%3c was concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and %0a%3c fructified it. And it is referred to as "A fructiferous tree, wherein is the seed %0a%3c thereof" (Beresheet, 1:12). And this seed exists in the mark of the covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The five leaves are the five Sefirot of the Light reflected from Malchut, which %0a%3c she raises from the Zivug de Hakaa. The direct incoming Light is called five %0a%3c Hassadim HGT-NH, and it clothes into five parts (types of restrictions) of the %0a%3c Returning Light HGT-NH, called the five rigid leaves of a rose, which correspond %0a%3c to the text from the second (the spirit of God soared over the waters) to the third %0a%3c (and said) mention of the word Elokim in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c These words explain how the five rigid leaves (attributes) can be extracted %0a%3c from Malchut so that she will be fit for a Zivug and achieve the big state. And %0a%3c during the big state, when the five rigid leaves become five restrictions, they %0a%3c are defined as the five gates of reception of the Light of Hassadim of the Direct %0a%3c Light, and they are called salvation, and Malchut is called the cup of salvation or %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the cup of blessing and good fortune, for, thanks to these leaves (restrictions), %0a%3c Malchut can receive the Light of Hassadim— a blessing. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cup of blessing must rest on five fingers, for Malchut can receive the Light %0a%3c of Hochma only if she is clothed in the Light of Hassadim beforehand. Therefore, %0a%3c first she has to make a blessing, which means to receive the five parts (NRNHY) %0a%3c of the Light of Hassadim with the help of five fingers (five restrictions), and only %0a%3c then to receive in them (i.e., in the corrected intentions) the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, a cup of wine must be raised with two hands, as five fingers of %0a%3c the right hand symbolize mercy— Hassadim, and five fingers of the left hand %0a%3c symbolize restrictions. However, having started the blessing, the cup must only %0a%3c be held with the five fingers of the right hand (Hassadim, bestowing). Otherwise, %0a%3c the impure forces that take from the left (receiving) side become active, as such %0a%3c forces cling only to a place where there is reception of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c What follows is the big state of Malchut, which corresponds to the words %0a%3c of the To rah: "Let there be Light." These are the five lights, in which Adam %0a%3c saw the world from end to end, as it is written in the Talmud (Hagigah, 12). %0a%3c But the Creator saw that there would be transgressions in the generations of %0a%3c the Flood and the Tower of Babel, and concealed this Light. And the following %0a%3c generations will then need to attain it on their own. %0a%3c %0a%3c Previously, these five Hassadim were in Yesod of ZA, and Malchut received %0a%3c from it, and not from Bina, called Elokim, as she does now. Yesod de ZA is %0a%3c called the mark of the covenant with the Creator (after the corrections, called %0a%3c circumcision, are made), and five Hassadim received on the five restrictions are %0a%3c called "seed." The main force of restrictions and the impact forces of the screen, %0a%3c with which it repels the Light, are in Ateret Yesod (the end of the Sefira Yesod). %0a%3c There occurs Zivug de Hakaa, from which Malchut receives the Light. Only at the %0a%3c end of correction will this Zivug pass on to Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, during the 6,000 years, the screen that is in Yesod, strikes at %0a%3c the incoming Light (pleasure) with its five restrictions (the forces that oppose %0a%3c egoistic reception of pleasure), thus creating five parts of the Returning Light, %0a%3c and receiving in them the five parts of the Light of Hassadim. Subsequently, %0a%3c ZA passes these five Lights of Hassadim from his Yesod to Nukva. And these five %0a%3c Lights of Hassadim are called "seed." %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. Just as the covenant is conceived from that seed in forty-two Zivugim, %0a%3c so the secret name fills and inseminates all forty-two letters of the initial %0a%3c act of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The name "forty-two" = MB = Mem + Bet = 40 + 2 is composed of HaVaYaH %0a%3c (four letters), filled HaVaYaH (ten letters), and doubly filled HaVaYaH (twenty- %0a%3c eight letters). In all, 4 + 10 + 28 = 42, signifying the seed that exists in the mark %0a%3c of the covenant that is enclosed in five Hassadim and five Gevurot. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two aspects to Nukva: her body (Partzuf), which emerges from Bina, %0a%3c and her Zivug, called the secret of unity with ZA. Nukva can be in two states: %0a%3c small or big (Katnut or Gadlut respectively). The small state is an incomplete, %0a%3c insufficient state of Malchut, but it is necessary as preparation for the big state, %0a%3c called the revelation of the secret, of the concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the big state reveals the small, and all that is concealed in the %0a%3c small state becomes clear in the big, he who is in a state of spiritual descent does %0a%3c not see the reasons for his state, but it all becomes clear to him when he attains %0a%3c the big state that follows. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the ascent of Malchut of AVI to their Bina, Partzuf of Bina (AVI) %0a%3c was divided into two parts: the upper part, GE, acquired the name AVI, while %0a%3c the lower part, AHP, became known as YESHSUT. AVI are filled with the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim, since they wish for no other, and YESHSUT receives it from them, %0a%3c for, although it desires the Light of Hochma, it cannot receive it in view of the %0a%3c fact that Malchut of AVI ascended above it. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although there is no Light of Hochma in AVI, they do not suffer %0a%3c without it whatsoever, and therefore exist in perfection called GAR, even in the %0a%3c absence of the Light of Hochma. And even when one raises MAN requesting %0a%3c strength (i.e., the Light of Hochma) so as to overcome his impure desires, AVI %0a%3c do not receive the Light of Hochma. YESHSUT receives this Light and passes it %0a%3c to ZA. Hence, although AVI are below the Rosh of AA, and there is no Light of %0a%3c Hochma in them, they do not suffer from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, YESHSUT suffers from the absence of the Light of Hochma, %0a%3c wishing to pass it to ZA, so it waits for MAN from ZA in order to ascend to AVI %0a%3c in the form of Sefira Daat. For when the lower ones raise MAN, the whole of %0a%3c Bina ascends to the Rosh of AA; YESHSUT receives the Light of Hochma from %0a%3c AA and passes it to ZON. This corresponds to the disappearance of the letter Yod %0a%3c from the word Avir (air), and Avir turns into Ohr— Light (Hochma) once more. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, for all that, even in the Rosh of AA, AVI remain only with the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim (air). Hence, the heads of both AA and AVI are called "Supreme %0a%3c Waters" or "Heaven." This is considering the fact that AVI can be beneath the %0a%3c Rosh of AA; however, since it does not affect their independence and perfection, %0a%3c it is as if they are in the Rosh of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 62 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Under AVI there is a firmament (Parsa) of the world of Atzilut, which %0a%3c separates the Kelim of bestowal from the Kelim of reception of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. YESHSUT and ZON (inferior waters) that need the Light of Hochma %0a%3c stand below the Parsa, which is in the chest of AA. It is therefore said that %0a%3c the inferior waters weep (i.e., their state is small), for they feel the lack of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma and wish to ascend to the Rosh of AA. In no way should one confuse %0a%3c the Parsa of the world of Atzilut (located within the world of Atzilut) that divides %0a%3c it into GE and AHP with the Parsa below the world Atzilut that separates it from %0a%3c the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that is received above the Parsa of the world of Atzilut is called the %0a%3c Light of Mem-Bet (MB). However, the seven Sefirot of ZON (six Sefirot of ZA and %0a%3c one Sefira of Malchut) that designate the seven days of creation cannot receive %0a%3c this Light of MB, as they are located below the Parsa and receive only the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim (minimal sustenance) from YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when the lower ones (man) raise MAN, and MAD descends from %0a%3c AB-SAG (the Light that brings Bina back to the Rosh of AA), YESHSUT receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma and passes it to ZON, allowing ZON to ascend above the %0a%3c Parsa that stands in the Chazeh (chest) of AA, and receive the Light of MB. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the Light of MB in ZON is manifested in thirty-two Elokim and %0a%3c ten sayings, where thirty-two Elokim represent YESHSUT in the state of ascent, %0a%3c when YESHSUT receives thirty-two streams of wisdom (Hochma) that create in %0a%3c it the thirty-two names of Elokim, mentioned in the act of creation: "In the %0a%3c beginning the Creator created," and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten sayings are five Hassadim. After ZON have already received the %0a%3c Light of Hochma from thirty-two Elokim, the five Lights of Hassadim that were %0a%3c received from AVI (signifying MB) are called "Supreme Waters." We see that the %0a%3c five Hassadim in ZON do not turn into the name MB before they receive from %0a%3c thirty-two Elokim. It is therefore said that thirty-two Elokim and ten sayings form %0a%3c the name MB, i.e., in the state of ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Rabbi Hizkiyah said that the five Lights in the saying "Let there be %0a%3c Light" (signifying the five Hassadim) are called "seed" (abundance), which Yesod %0a%3c of ZA passes to Malchut. And it is called MB, although essentially it is merely %0a%3c five Hassadim; however, since it has the Light of Hochma that was received from %0a%3c thirty-two Elokim of YESHSUT, it refers to MB. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. In the Beginning, Rabbi Shimon opened, "The flower buds have appeared %0a%3c on the earth" (In Hebrew the words "land" and "earth" are designated by the %0a%3c same word, Eretz', Song of Songs, 2:12). "The flower buds" refer to the act of %0a%3c creation; "appeared on the earth." When? On the third day, as it is said, "And %0a%3c the earth brought forth grass" (Beresheet, 1:12). "The time of singing has %0a%3c come" refers to the fourth day, the time of strictness, judgment, restriction. %0a%3c Therefore, on the fourth day, the word "lights" is written with a missing letter, %0a%3c which hints at the strictness of judgment and a curse. "And the voice of the %0a%3c turtle dove is heard" refers to the fifth day, on which it is said, "Let the waters %0a%3c swarm," so that they can produce offspring. However, the words "is heard" %0a%3c already refer to the sixth day, on which it is said, "Let us make man," who, %0a%3c in the future, shall put action before understanding (we shall do and we shall %0a%3c hear, Naaseh ve Nishmah). For here it is said, "Let us make man," and there %0a%3c it is said, "We shall do and we shall hear." "In our land" refers to the day of %0a%3c Shabbat, which is like the Land of Life, the world to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is completely incomprehensible to us how The Zohar compares the words %0a%3c from Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs, 2:12) with what is written in the Torah about %0a%3c the first days of creation. The six days of creation symbolize the six Sefirot HGT %0a%3c NHY of ZA, onto which all ten Sefirot of Nukva are built. This is because Nukva %0a%3c is only the will to receive (pleasure), while her entire spiritual body (desires of %0a%3c bestowal) consists of her husband's Sefirot, ZA, the altruistic properties that ZA %0a%3c passes to Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva herself (the created desire to receive pleasure) is an empty place %0a%3c unfilled with Light (the Creator). This is because the Light can only enter a %0a%3c desire (Klz) with similar properties to itself. Therefore, to the extent of her %0a%3c similarity to ZA, the properties that Malchut receives from ZA, those corrected %0a%3c properties of Malchut turn into a Partzuf and become filled with the Light that %0a%3c corresponds to their correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the greater the correction that is made in a particular part, the greater %0a%3c the Light (of the five Lights NRNHY) that enters that part. The corrected and %0a%3c fulfilled part of Malchut is referred to as a "world." Here and henceforth, The %0a%3c Zohar explains how ~Nukva is built out of ZA, i.e., how the world is created. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva is called "earth." Flower buds are Sefirot— the properties of ZA %0a%3c that appear and grow within Malchut on the third day of creation, which %0a%3c corresponds to Sefira Tifferet (Hesed-l, Gevura-2, Tifferet-3). In the beginning, %0a%3c Malchut was created as ZA in height; two equally great celestial bodies, the %0a%3c Sun— ZA and the Moon— Malchut. This is why we see them as being equal in %0a%3c size when the Moon is full. After all, all that is said with regard to man. In the %0a%3c initial state following her creation, Malchut is a point at the feet of ZA, and %0a%3c subsequently grows along him. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is to say, on the third day of creation, Malchut was equal in height %0a%3c (had the same properties) to Tifferet of ZA. However, Malchut was not able to %0a%3c receive the Light in such a state. Hence, it is said, STRICTNESS (judgment) %0a%3c APPEARED ON THE EARTH (in Malchut); the flower buds merely appeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c And after that, THE TIME OF SINGING HAS COME already refers to the %0a%3c fourth day of creation, when Malchut was diminished, because she complained %0a%3c to the Creator: "Two angels cannot wear one crown"— if Malchut is equal to ZA %0a%3c in height, she cannot receive the Light of Hochma from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for that being— not having received the Light of Hassadim from %0a%3c ZA beforehand, Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma, as the Light of %0a%3c Hochma can only be received within the Light of Hassadim, by clothing the Light %0a%3c of Hochma (pleasure) into the Light of Hassadim (the intention to enjoy "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator answered Malchut: "Go and diminish yourself." In other %0a%3c words: if, owing to your egoistic properties, you cannot receive the Light %0a%3c independently, but only from ZA, then diminish your own properties, accept %0a%3c His, and gradually correct yourself. Then you will be able to receive all of the %0a%3c Light and be like Him (ZA— the Creator). All of this is described in the Talmud %0a%3c (Hullin, 60:2), but only with the explanation provided in The Zohar do we stop %0a%3c perceiving it as a fairytale. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then Malchut descended below Yesod of ZA, and her nine lower Sefirot %0a%3c fell below Parsa into the worlds of BYA. And only her Sefira Keter remained %0a%3c in Atzilut as a point standing below Yesod of ZA. And from here on, Malchut %0a%3c is built not of her own Sefirot (properties) that exist in BYA, but of Sefirot %0a%3c (properties) Net^ah and Hod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Malchut was previously bigger, she was not able to receive the %0a%3c Light for lack of the Light of Hassadim; now she will be smaller, but she will %0a%3c have the Light of Hassadim, in which she will be able to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hochma. Even though Malchut will be at a lower degree, she will be able to utilize %0a%3c it, for the Light of Hassadim repels the impure forces that cling to Nulcva. That %0a%3c is the meaning of the word Zamir (singing/ pruning). However, there is another %0a%3c meaning to this word that is at use here— cutting off, or pruning the impure %0a%3c forces from Malchut (rose bud). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE DOVE: The turtle dove is a Sefira, the %0a%3c property of Net^ah de ZA, and the voice of the turtle dove represents Sefira Hod %0a%3c of ZA, the fifth day of creation. And since Malchut receives from Yesod (which %0a%3c receives from Hod that is joined with Netjah), such reception by Malchut is %0a%3c referred to as "the voice of the turtle dove." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words "is heard" refer to the sixth day, since the voice of the %0a%3c turtle dove (Malchut) is heard only with the help of the sixth day, Yesod of ZA, %0a%3c which includes both Net^ah and Hod, and passes their Light to Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c it is said that this voice is heard in Malchut only from Yesod, on the sixth day. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Malchut can receive the Light only from the %0a%3c middle line of ZA: either from Yesod of ZA (she receives the degree called NHY, %0a%3c Ihur - embryo) or from Tifferet of ZA (she receives the degree called HGT = VAK, %0a%3c Yenilca - nursing or Katnut - smallness) or from Daat of ZA (she receives the %0a%3c degree called HBD = GAR, Mochin - brain or Gadlut - big). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Left %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LINES %0a%3c %0a%3c Middle %0a%3c %0a%3c _L_ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Right %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NAME %0a%3c OF DEGREE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT %0a%3c IN THE DEGREE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( Bina %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c )M %0a%3c Daat %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma) %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HBD {HaBaD) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Neshama %0a%3c = The light of HBD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ( Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ! , %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HGT [HaGaT) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Ruach %0a%3c = The light of HGT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c f Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H-( %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah J %0a%3c j %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NHY {NeHY) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Nefesh %0a%3c = The light of NHY %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LET US MAKE MAN, FOR IN THE FUTURE HE SHALL PUT ACTION %0a%3c BEFORE LISTENING: sight refers to Sefira Hochma, hearing refers to Sefira %0a%3c Bina. Action or deed is a property of Malchut. In order to correct Malchut, the %0a%3c Creator's only creation (other Sefirot are properties of the Creator Himself, with %0a%3c which He gradually created Malchut), a second restriction was made— Malchut %0a%3c ascended to Bina so as to combine her egoistic properties of reception with %0a%3c Bina's altruistic properties of bestowal; Malchut ascended to Aba-Hochma, and %0a%3c Ima-Bina found herself below Malchut (Parsa), where she became similar in her %0a%3c properties to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eyes refer to Sefira Hochma or Aba. Malchut ascended to the level of eyes and %0a%3c stands at the level of pupils. Malchut is called Nukva; and Malchut that stands %0a%3c at the level of eyes is called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils) or NE. That is why there are %0a%3c only Keter and Hochma in the Rosh (head) of AA: Bina fell from the Rosh to the %0a%3c Guf (body) and Malchut is above Bina, that is, Malchut represents an action that %0a%3c is Above, i.e., precedes perception and understanding. This is what is meant %0a%3c by "we will do, and we will hear"— the act of the second restriction, limiting %0a%3c reception only to GE. Such a state is called the "return" (in one's properties to %0a%3c the Creator). The "complete return" occurs when AHP of Malchut gets corrected %0a%3c and joins GE at this degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's ascent to NE, she changes her properties (every one %0a%3c of us needs only this— to ascend to the level of the Creator's properties, so that %0a%3c we can receive them and become like Him), and is now ready to ascend to AVI %0a%3c and receive the Light of Haya. The constant Light of this level is called the First %0a%3c Temple. That is why when receiving the Torah, Israel elected to act first and hear %0a%3c after. And for this reason they merited reception of the Torah (Talmud, Shabbat, %0a%3c 85:1), as the action (Malchut) ascended and clothed AVI, and thus the secret of %0a%3c the fifty gates of Bina was revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Construction of the Temple does not pertain to it being built in this world, %0a%3c but rather to the attainment of the degree of the Temple, the degree of AVI %0a%3c de Atzilut, the Light of Haya (the First Temple) or the degree of YESH %0a%3c Atzilut, the Light of Neshama (the Second Temple). %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar tells us: "it is heard" on the sixth day, for on this day (in this %0a%3c state) Malchut was corrected by means of her ascent above Bina, referred to as %0a%3c "placing action before listening," to do and to hear as during the reception of %0a%3c the Torah. Malchut in the state of ascension to Bina is called the Eternal Land or %0a%3c the Land of Life, for she inherits life from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "IN OUR LAND" REFERS TO SHABBAT, WHICH IS LIKE THE %0a%3c ETERNAL LAND OF LIFE: Ima-Bina is called the Land of Life or the Eternal %0a%3c Land. As a result of the act on the sixth day, meaning the Creator's action from %0a%3c Above (the factor of time is designated by an action of the Creator Himself, %0a%3c which has no causes in our world), Malchut ascended to Ima on the seventh day %0a%3c of creation (Shabbat) and became like Ima, for when the lower one ascends to %0a%3c the degree of the Upper One, they become equal (in properties). Hence, upon %0a%3c ascending to Bina and there receiving the Light of Haya, Malchut is called the %0a%3c Land of Eternal Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Another explanation: flower buds are the Patriarchs, who entered the mind %0a%3c and entered into the world to come, Bina, where they remain concealed. %0a%3c From there they emerge in concealment and conceal themselves in the true %0a%3c prophets. Yosef was born and they concealed themselves within him. When %0a%3c Yosef entered the Holy Land, he erected them there, and then "they appeared %0a%3c on the earth" and were revealed there. When did they appear? When a rainbow %0a%3c can be seen, they become revealed. At that moment, "the time of singing has %0a%3c come," meaning the time to eradicate all the wicked in the world. Why did %0a%3c they survive? Because the flower buds have appeared on (from) the earth. And %0a%3c if they were to be seen beforehand, they could not have remained in the %0a%3c world, and the world would not have been able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 68 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar explains the attainment of the Light of Haya by ZA. NHY of %0a%3c ZA are called "sons" and HGT of ZA are called "patriarchs," as well as the "turtle %0a%3c dove." ZA himself (seemingly) consists of two parts: above his Chazeh, his Sefirot %0a%3c HGT are called the big ZON; below his Chazeh, Sefirot NHY are called the small %0a%3c ZON. Sefirot HGT correspond to Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, while NHY %0a%3c correspond to Moshe, Aaron and Yosef. Malchut corresponds to King David. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefirot NHY are called "prophets," and Yesod is called "the righteous one." %0a%3c Here The Zohar speaks of the buds that gradually grow from the small state %0a%3c to the big state of ZON: first ZON were small, consisting of Sefirot NHY with %0a%3c the Light of Ne/esh and called Uhar (embryo). Then, with the help of Yenika %0a%3c (nursing), i.e., receiving Light from Ima, ZON grew. Accordingly, the properties %0a%3c of Sefirot NHY grew to equalize those of Sefirot HGT, and Sefirot NHY received %0a%3c the Light of Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the Partzuf now consists of parts of HGT and NHY with the Lights %0a%3c Ruach and Ne/esh. Subsequently, by further reception of strength from the Upper %0a%3c One, and further growth, they've attained the state of Gadlut Aleph, the first big %0a%3c state. Accordingly, Sefirot HGT became HBD with the Light of Neshama, Sefirot %0a%3c NHY became Sefirot HGT, and received new Sefirot NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the Partzuf grew to include three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY with the %0a%3c Lights Ne/esh, Ruach, and Nesharna. And it is called Gadol (big— the first big state). %0a%3c Then, through further growth, they've attainted the state of maturity (Gadlut %0a%3c Bet, the second big state), and the Light of Haya entered Sefirot HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Embryo 2. Small 3. Big %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "growth" refers to the growth of a screen, of man's inner anti- %0a%3c egoistic forces and desires. This is the only difference between a big vessel and %0a%3c a small one, the only difference between the Partzufim. Their inner properties %0a%3c change depending on the change in the magnitude of the screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c THESE FATHERS ENTERED THE SUPERNAL MIND AND %0a%3c ASCENDED INTO THE WORLD TO COME: this sentence speaks of the %0a%3c prenatal development of ZA, when he ascends to AVI (called "Supernal Mind" %0a%3c or "Supernal Thought"). Aba-Hochma is called "mind" or "thought," and lma- %0a%3c Bina is called "the world to come." And together they are called "parents"— father %0a%3c and mother, AVI. It is there that creation begins— conception of ZA in the initial %0a%3c state of a spiritual embryo. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ler, so can every man become a spiritual embryo; if he completely relinqui %0a%3c all of his desires and actions, and submits entirely to the will of the Upper %0a%3c Partzuf, he will turn himself into a spiritual embryo, just like a physiological %0a%3c one. The difference between a physiological embryo and a spiritual one lies %0a%3c in the fact that becoming a spiritual embryo requires tremendous personal %0a%3c sire and effort, whereas the conception of a physiological embryo deper %0a%3c rents. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pends %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of its prenatal development within Bina (which means that one %0a%3c completely extinguishes all of his personal desires and thoughts, and, like an %0a%3c embryo, is ready to accept all that the mother gives: all of her thoughts and %0a%3c properties, regardless of how incomprehensible or unnatural they may seem to %0a%3c his essence), this embryo achieves the state of its spiritual birth. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this is a state of an even greater concealment of the Upper Light %0a%3c with regard to the embryo, for it does not yet have a screen for the reception of %0a%3c this Light. Hence, this state is called Katnut, CONCEALED IN THE TRUE %0a%3c PROPHETS, i.e., in Sefirot Netzah and Hod, which ZA attains as a result of %0a%3c the process of nursing, reception of milk, the Light of Hassadim from Ima %0a%3c (mother) Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of nursing comes to the NHY of ZA, and ZA attains VAK (Light %0a%3c of Nefesh-Ruach), the state of Katnut. During nursing, ZA attains the Sefira %0a%3c Yesod, which is why it is said that Yosef is born. After the nursing period is over, %0a%3c ZA ascends to AVI so as to receive from them the Light of Neshama, and this %0a%3c constitutes the state of Gadlut, called "Yosef." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA consists of three parts: HBD, HGT, and NHY. The process of Zeir Anpin's %0a%3c growth, of acquiring a screen on his desires, begins with the purest, least egoistic %0a%3c part— Sefirot HBD, in which he first receives the Light of Nefesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards, ZA acquires a screen on coarser egoistic desires— Sefirot HGT; %0a%3c the Light of Nefesh passes from HBD to HGT, and the Light of Ruach enters the %0a%3c empty HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, ZA acquires a screen on the most egoistic Kelim— Sefirot NHY; the %0a%3c Light of Ne/esh passes from HGT to NHY, the Light of Ruach moves from HBD %0a%3c to the empty HGT, and the Light of Neshama enters the empty HBD. %0a%3c %0a%3c The attainment of the big state by ZA is called the birth of Yosef, for there %0a%3c emerge Sefirot NHY, of which the last Sefira, Yesod, is called "Yosef." However, %0a%3c since the Light of Haya is not yet present, this state is called "concealment." %0a%3c WHEN YOSEF ENTERED THE HOLY LAND AND ERECTED THEM %0a%3c THERE: that is, after the attainment of the first big state, the reception of the %0a%3c Light of Neshama, ZA continues to grow, cultivating his screen until the Light %0a%3c of Haya enters it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, Malchut of ZA separates from him into an independent %0a%3c Partzuf, called THE HOLY LAND, as the Light of Haya is called holiness. It %0a%3c is therefore said that Yosef entered or, rather, ASCENDED TO THE HOLY %0a%3c LAND in the Gadlut state of ZA. ZA and ~Nukva became equally big in the state %0a%3c of PBP (Panim be Panim, face to face), which is the state that determines the Zivug %0a%3c between ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND YOSEF ERECTED THEM THERE: the Light of Haya or Hochma %0a%3c fills the Partzuf only during a Zivug, when ZON (ZA and Nukva) make a Zivug %0a%3c together. And this Light remains in Malchut, for only she (her screen) can %0a%3c reveal it. Just as AVI are GAR de Bina, YESHSLT is ZAT de Bina and the Light %0a%3c of Hochma is found only in YESHSLT, the relationship between Malchut and %0a%3c ZA works along the same principle, and the Light of Hochma is revealed only %0a%3c in Malchut. Therefore, only when the Light of Hochma fills Nu/cva can it be %0a%3c said that the Light has been revealed, and until that happens, it is considered %0a%3c to be concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c WHEN ARE THEY SEEN? WHEN A RAINBOW CAN BE SEEN IN %0a%3c THE WORLD: ZA is called a "rainbow," the world is Malchut, and their union %0a%3c is called a "rainbow within a cloud." THE TIME HAS COME TO ERADICATE %0a%3c ALL THE WICKED FROM THE WORLD-as the number of the wicked grows, %0a%3c as more impure forces cling to ZON. The impure forces can influence ZON so %0a%3c greatly that the entire world will be brought to ruin, as has happened in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flower Buds %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c time of the Flood. If so, there is no salvation for man other than through the %0a%3c revelation of the Upper Light, the Light of Haya. That is why The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the world is saved by the flower buds appearing from the earth, meaning %0a%3c that the Light of Haya eradicates man's impure forces from the earth (his desires, %0a%3c Malchut), and they cannot cling to her and hinder man. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND HAD THEY NOT APPEARED, THERE WOULD BE NO %0a%3c SALVATION FOR THE WORLD-for initially Nuba is built as big as ZA. %0a%3c This is called the "two great celestial bodies," when Malchut is on the same %0a%3c degree as ZA, but stands behind him, back to back, unable to receive the %0a%3c Light of Hochma in the absence of the Light of Hassadim. This is why Malchut %0a%3c complains about lacking the Light of Hassadim and thus not being able to %0a%3c receive the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even though the moon grows as big as the Sun, it cannot shine independently, %0a%3c but only if the Sun (ZA) gives it Light. And since Malchut lacks the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, such a state is called reversed (Achor-back). And a Zivug cannot take %0a%3c place in the position of back-to-back (Achor he Achor). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Nukva is born and grows (receives the properties) from the %0a%3c Guf of ZA, as it is written in the Torah (Beresheet 2) that Chava (Eve) was born %0a%3c from the body of Adam, she becomes equal to ZA and enters into a Zivug face- %0a%3c to-face (Panim he Panim, PBP) with him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Nukva still retained the previous Light. Moreover, precisely because %0a%3c she felt the lack of the Light in her initial state, Malchut received the Light of %0a%3c Haya specifically into her previous sufferings. Similarly, man can feel pleasure %0a%3c only and precisely because of his previous suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us that had the flower buds not appeared in %0a%3c Malchut during her Katnut, when she was standing behind ZA, she would not %0a%3c have been able to receive the Light of Haya in her state of Gadlut, as she would %0a%3c not have the Kelim (desires) to receive this Light. Every new creation is founded %0a%3c on the sensation of darkness, as it is said: the Creator emanates the Light out of %0a%3c Himself, and creates darkness out of nothingness. Man's sensation of darkness %0a%3c signifies his readiness to receive the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. Who sustains the world and evokes the revelation of the Patriarchs? It is the %0a%3c voice of the children engaged in the Torah. The world exists thanks to these %0a%3c children. Hence, it is said: "We will make for you pendants of gold" (Shir %0a%3c HaShirim, 1:11). These are the children, youngsters of the world, as it is said: %0a%3c "Make two cherubs of gold" (Shemot, 25:18). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 72 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Ruach is called "the children of the world," and the Zivug in this %0a%3c state (PBA-face to back) is referred to as THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN %0a%3c ENGAGED IN THE TORAH. And it is also called "threads of gold" and %0a%3c "two cherubs of gold." Before Nukva grew, the impure forces had the power to %0a%3c destroy the world. However, precisely because Nukva grows from ZA, the right %0a%3c and left lines merge in her as one, the RAINBOW (right line) shines WITHIN %0a%3c A CLOUD (left line), and the Light of Haya can enter Malchut. Without this %0a%3c Light, the world can be destroyed as during (in the state of) the Flood. %0a%3c %0a%3c SO WHO IS IT THAT SUSTAINS THE WORLD: who causes the %0a%3c appearance of the Light of Hayal They are precisely the children engaged in %0a%3c the Torah. The "children" designate the Light of the opposite side, the Light %0a%3c of Ruach, the sensation of deficiency of the Light of Haya, for a "child" alludes %0a%3c to the process of nursing. The children of the house of Raban (Tinokot Shel Beit %0a%3c Raban)— are the Light of Haya, as the word "Raban" derives from "Rat/" (big, %0a%3c Haya). They did not transgress, i.e., did not use their AHP (egoistic and yet %0a%3c uncorrected desires, for the word "children" designates the small state), their %0a%3c will to receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 7. In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes and you shall %0a%3c see, WHO HAS CREATED THESE" (Xeshayahu, 40:26). Raise your eyes %0a%3c where? To the place on which all eyes depend. Who is He? He is the One who %0a%3c opens eyes, Mcdchut de Rosh de Arich Anpin. And there you shall see that %0a%3c Atik is concealed and within it lies the answer to the question: WHO HAS %0a%3c CREATED THESE? WHO? MI, ZAT de Bina, the Highest Edge of Heaven, %0a%3c and everything depends on Him. And since the question lies in Him, and He %0a%3c is concealed, He is called MI. For MI is like when the question "Who?" is %0a%3c asked, as there are no questions above Him. The question is found only at the %0a%3c Highest Boundary of Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, Rabbi Elazar opened, "Raise your eyes on high and look %0a%3c at who has created these." Raise your eyes to what place? To the place, where %0a%3c all eyes depend on Him. And who is He? He is the One who opens eyes. And %0a%3c there you shall know. It is the concealed Atik, within which lies the question: %0a%3c who has created these? And who is He? MI = who. He is called by the edge of the %0a%3c Supernal Heaven, where everything belongs to him. Since there lies a question, %0a%3c and He is on a concealed path and does not reveal Himself, He is called MI. %0a%3c And because there is no question Above, this edge of Heaven is called MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Hebrew, the word MI means the question "Who?" as well as the %0a%3c preposition "from." Since Kabbalah tells us about the property of our world's %0a%3c roots, one spiritual object can sometimes reveal an entire range of associations, %0a%3c properties, and categories. In the same way, here the word MI is a part of the %0a%3c word EloklM, where the last two letters form the word MI. However, at the same %0a%3c time, they carry a variety of additional charges and meanings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar wishes to explain how Heaven and earth were created. %0a%3c Naturally, just like the whole of the Torah, The Zohar refers only to spiritual %0a%3c degrees and categories, and does not deal with explanations of the physical %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c origin and development of our world. Moreover, it is impossible to understand %0a%3c the true origin and development of our world without attaining the spiritual %0a%3c world. However, whatever one does attain, he is unable to pass these attainments %0a%3c to others. Hence, even after he attains the full essence of our nature's origin %0a%3c and its actions, he will still be unable to describe it in a form that will be %0a%3c comprehensible to others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and earth constitute the seven days of Creation— ZON of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. However, if it is a part of Atzilut, then why is it described as %0a%3c BARAH (created, from the word Beria) and not ATZIL (emanated, from the %0a%3c word Atzilut) 7 . Yet, precisely herein lies the opportunity to open our eyes to the %0a%3c process of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rosh (head) de AA has only Keter and Hochma. Malchut standing below the %0a%3c eyes, below Sefira Hochma, is called "the opening of the eyes." After all, only %0a%3c when she opens up does the Light of Hochma pass through her from Rosh de AA %0a%3c to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that the eyes should be raised up TO THE PLACE %0a%3c ON WHICH ALL EYES DEPEND, for the Light of Hochma can fill all the %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut only when Malchut opens up in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c Hence, the entire secret of the opening lies in Malchut. The Light of Hochma %0a%3c (the Light of Wisdom) is the Light of the eyes. It comes out of the eyes, and %0a%3c only in this Light can one see. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word BARAH signifies BAR (beyond), meaning outside the world %0a%3c of Atzilut. This is because Bina herself came out of the Rosh of AA and stood %0a%3c lower, outside the Rosh of AA, giving birth to, that is, precisely BARAH %0a%3c (creating) ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Hebrew, every notion has several possible names that determine the %0a%3c specific action that takes place. Here, the birth of ZON occurred by means %0a%3c of Bina's exit and descent from her degree; hence, the birth of ZON is called %0a%3c BARAH, from the word BAR - outside (of one's degree). %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire creation consists of only ten Sefirot. Yet, since every Sefira includes %0a%3c all the others, and since all of them are interconnected, every world, degree, %0a%3c or Sefira includes the properties of all the others, and consists of their parts. %0a%3c Therefore, every Sefira consists of Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut, each of %0a%3c which in turn consists of five. In all, 5x5x5 = 125 Sefirot or steps of the ladder %0a%3c that separate us (the lowest) from the Creator (the highest). %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Bina herself is not to receive the Light of Hochma. Yet, in %0a%3c order to pass the Light of Hochma to ZA and Malchut, who desire to receive it for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Creator's sake, since receiving the Light of Hochma is the goal of creation, %0a%3c Bina allocates within herself a certain part called ZAT de Bina or YESHSUT, %0a%3c which receives the Light of Hochma from Partzuf Hochma and passes it to ZON. %0a%3c The main part, Bina herself, is called GAR de Bina. The part of Bina that receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma is called ZAT de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if Bina exits the Rosh and falls into the Guf, as it occurs in the %0a%3c second restriction, this has no effect on Bina herself, for she does not suffer %0a%3c from lack of the Light of Hochma whatsoever, as though she had never left the %0a%3c Rosh. This refers only to the Upper part of Bina, GAR de Bina, which has no %0a%3c desire for Hochma. This part is called AVI, and it spans from the Peh (mouth) %0a%3c down to the Chazeh (chest) of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, ZAT de Bina, which wants to receive Hochma for ZON, just as a %0a%3c mother who wants to receive for her children, feels the exit from the Rosh of AA %0a%3c to its Guf, for there it cannot receive the Light of Hochma, but only the Light %0a%3c of Ruach-Nefesh, VAK of the Light. This part of Bina is called YESHSUT, and it %0a%3c spans from the Chazeh down to Tahur of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut, which receive from YESHSUT, span from Tahur %0a%3c to the end of the feet of AA, on the Parsa. Thus, there are two Parsaot (plural for %0a%3c Parsa): one is in the world of Atzilut, separating the Sefirot of "bestowal" (GE) %0a%3c from the Sefirot of "reception" (AHP). This Parsa is located at the chest of AA. %0a%3c The second Parsa is located between Atzilut and BYA. However, we can also say %0a%3c that every Partzuf has its own Parsa, which separates the desires of bestowal from %0a%3c the desires of reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT = ZAT de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI = GAR de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PehH %0a%3c %0a%3c Rosh %0a%3c Peh— I- Chazeh- %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chazeh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Tabur %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although GAR de Bina are positioned below the Rosh of AA, they are %0a%3c considered not to have left it, as they do not feel it, that is, they do not want %0a%3c Hochma; they wish only to bestow, and he who wants only to bestow feels %0a%3c perfection wherever he is. All the Partzufim and their parts that have nothing %0a%3c to do with reception of Hochma (Keter, Hochma, and GAR de Bina) separate %0a%3c themselves with a Parsa from the remaining parts of the world of Atzilut that %0a%3c want Hochma (ZAT de Bina and ZON). %0a%3c %0a%3c The "existence of the question" that The Zohar speaks of signifies the %0a%3c sensation of the lack of Light of Hochma, the desire for it. This is felt by ZON, %0a%3c which is why they raise MAN. MAN is a request of the lower one to receive %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from the Upper One for the Creator's sake. It is called %0a%3c a "question," for a question is similar to prayer or request. The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the question exists only in YESHSUT, meaning that it receives MAN from %0a%3c below, from ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c And before that, it is said of YESHSUT: BARAH (from the word Beria = BAR), %0a%3c something that exists outside of its degree. What did it do? BARAH (created) %0a%3c ELEH (AHP, ZON). However, it created them as headless as itself. For the word %0a%3c BARAH (beyond) indicates the lack of a Rosh (Kelim of the world of Atzilut). %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT de Bina that wait for an "answer to their question," for the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, are called MI. It is said BARAH in regards to them because they exited %0a%3c and descended independently from the level of the Rosh de AA to below its %0a%3c Chazeh. These are ZAT de Bina, called YESHSUT or MI, the "Highest Edge of %0a%3c Heaven," for Heaven refers to ZA, who receives from YESHSUT. Malchut is %0a%3c called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT de Bina is called "firmament." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called "Heaven." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c All that exists below YESHSUT (ZON and the worlds of BYA) receives from %0a%3c it. Hence, it is considered that YESHSUT revives the whole of creation: whatever %0a%3c it has, they will receive it, too. However, their MAN determines whether or not %0a%3c YESHSUT will have something to bestow upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THERE LIES NO QUESTION in GAR de Bina (AVI). They do not receive %0a%3c MAN for the reception of Hochma, and they never feel any lack of Hochma, %0a%3c neither for themselves nor so as to give to others. Only ZATde Bina or YESHSUT %0a%3c are created and exist for the question, for the reception of MAN (ZON's plea). %0a%3c YESHSUT raises MAN that is received from ZON to the Rosh of AA and receives %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 77 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from there. YESHSLT is called the "Highest Edge of %0a%3c Heaven," for ZA, called "Heaven," receives from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8. But there is another one below, called MA. What is in common between %0a%3c this one and that one? The first one is concealed and is called MI. There exists %0a%3c a question in it for man to inquire and research in order to see and know all %0a%3c the degrees, down to the end of all degrees, which is Malchut. That is MA. %0a%3c What does MA mean? MA (what) do you know? What do you see? What do %0a%3c you research? After all, everything is initially concealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Being in a state of Zivug PBP with ZA, Malchut is also called MA (like ZA) and %0a%3c is considered the lowest edge of Heaven, for she concludes all the degrees and %0a%3c Atzilut. ZA, called "Heaven," stands between Malchut (lowest edge of Heaven) %0a%3c and YESHSLT (Highest Edge of Heaven). %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN MUST INQUIRE, SEE, RESEARCH-only if one who is below %0a%3c ZON raises MAN (his prayer) to ZON will they raise this MAN higher. For ZON %0a%3c themselves are corrected by the Light of Hassadim, and do not want to receive %0a%3c the Light of Hochma. And only if a request comes from below, from man, will %0a%3c ZON ascend to YESHSLT and ask for the Light of Hochma. YESHSLT proceeds %0a%3c to raise MAN to AVI, and AVI raise MAN to AA: AVI ascend to the Rosh of AA, %0a%3c where there is the Light of Hochma, where they make a Zivug on this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Zivug of AVI is called "Aha and Ima looking at each other." To "look" %0a%3c means to receive the Light of Hochma (to "hear" means to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim). As a result of AVI's ascent to the Rosh of AA, Bina starts receiving %0a%3c Hochma for ZON. All the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut are corrected by the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim in such a way that they do not want to receive the Light of %0a%3c Hochma for themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who is able to raise his request (MAN) to compel ZON to ascend to %0a%3c YESHS LT, whereupon YESHS LT and AVI will ascend to the Rosh of AA together %0a%3c so as to receive the Light for him— such a person is not simply considered a mere %0a%3c "person," but a "righteous"! %0a%3c %0a%3c The request that one raises to ZON is called one's "soul," for a soul is a %0a%3c vessel, a desire filled with Light. However, the Light inside a vessel is determinec %0a%3c by the desire. Hence, the spiritual desire, the intention to act for the Creator's %0a%3c sake is called "a soul." Naturally, if one does not yet have such an intention, he %0a%3c ot have a soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual world is a world of only desires without any corporea %0a%3c hells. The reader must revise his ideas about the soul, body, connections %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c >rlds, etc., and correct himself continually so as to properly in %0a%3c ategories. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, man's corrected desires are called "the souls of the righteous." %0a%3c These souls of the righteous ascend to ZON in the form of MAN and compel %0a%3c ZON to ascend to YESHSUT. The presence of ZON creates in YESHSUT a %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Hochma. This compels YESHSUT (ZAT de Bina) to %0a%3c ascend to the Rosh of AA and there join with GAR de Bina (AVI) into one Partzuf. %0a%3c And then AVI (AB + SAG = AA + AVI) look at each other, exchange the Light of %0a%3c Hochma between them, and pass it down to ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without a request from below, AVI will be satisfied with the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim and will not "look" at one another. Only the request of their children %0a%3c (ZON) compels AVI to face each other (Panim be Panim) and make a Zivug. In %0a%3c this Zivug, Ima-Bina receives the Light of Hochma for the children, ZON, from %0a%3c Aha-Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this occurs BECAUSE MAN INQUIRED-man's question %0a%3c signifies the raising of MAN so as to make AVI look at each other, make a Zivug %0a%3c together, and let Ima receive Hochma from Aha for the man that is elevating his %0a%3c soul. The descending Light of Hochma is called knowledge or wisdom (Daat), %0a%3c for ZON ascend to YESHSUT + AVI, and there stimulate a Zivug on the Light %0a%3c of Hochma, called "knowledge." Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And Adam %0a%3c came to know his wife." %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, to COME TO KNOW means to receive the Light of Hochma. ZON %0a%3c that stand in AVI and compel AVI to receive the Light of Hochma are called Daat %0a%3c (knowledge) or the Sefira Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Daat is not an additional Sefira. There are only ten Sefirot. However, in %0a%3c order to designate the fact that ZON's request for the Light of Hochma is inside %0a%3c the ten Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, we say that AVI have a Sefira called Daat. In this case, %0a%3c instead of the regular count of Sefirot: KHB-HGT-NHYM, we count the Sefirot: %0a%3c HBD-HGT-NHYM. The Sefira Keter is omitted, and we only mention the Sefira %0a%3c Daat after HochmaAba and Bina-lma. FROM ONE DEGREE TO ANOTHER %0a%3c signifies the passing of the Light of Hochma from the Sefira Daat of the degree of %0a%3c AVI to the degree of ZA. And TO THE END OF ALL DEGREES-from ZA to %0a%3c Malchut, which is called "the end of all degrees." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Light is present in Nukva, she is called MA, and the Light that she %0a%3c passes to the lower ones is called 100 blessings. There are several states in Nukva, %0a%3c Malchut of the world of At^ilut. We need to know them, for all that we receive, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c we receive from her alone. In addition to all stages of growth from a point to a %0a%3c full Partzuf, a grown Malchut has two big states. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut attains the first big state when she receives the Light of Neshama. %0a%3c This occurs when, due to her MAN, AVI ascend one degree from their %0a%3c permanent place to the Rosh of AA. However, although YESHSUT ascends from %0a%3c its permanent place between the chest (Chazeh) and the navel (Tabur) of AA to %0a%3c where AVI used to be (between the mouth and the chest of AA), it still remains %0a%3c clothed onto the Guf of AA, even though it merges into one Partzuf with AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since YESHSUT now clothes the place from the mouth (Peh) to the %0a%3c Chazeh of AA from the outside, YESHSUT becomes like the Rosh of AA, as it %0a%3c merged with AVI in the Rosh of AA as one Partzuf. Also, YESHSUT ascends from %0a%3c under the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA and stands above it, where the %0a%3c Rosh of AA shines. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma to ZA, and ZA passes %0a%3c it on to Malchut, who fills herself with this Light, called "100 blessings," for, %0a%3c having received this Light, ZON can ascend to the permanent place of YESHSUT %0a%3c between the Chazeh and the Tabur of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c By ascending to this degree, Malchut becomes like Ima. In the spiritual %0a%3c world, the degree of a spiritual object determines all of its properties. Even %0a%3c in our world, the degree of man's inner development alone determines his %0a%3c properties, thoughts, and desires. And since Ima equals 100, Malchut, too, is %0a%3c called "100," so as to emphasize the fact that Malchut ascended to Bina of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now Malchut is similar to MI just as YESHSUT was prior to raising MAN and %0a%3c passing the Light. This is because she now clothes the place of the small state of %0a%3c YESHSUT from the Chazeh to the Tabur of AA, and stands under the Parsa of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, below which the Light from the Rosh de AA cannot pass. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why Malchut gained no Light, for the sake of which she had raised %0a%3c MAN. Nevertheless, Malchut gains by receiving the properties of Ima-Bina, for %0a%3c she ascended to YESHSUT, called Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Light that Malchut received is only considered VAK of the Gadlut %0a%3c state, the first state of Gadlut. Malchut will not be able to receive the GAR of %0a%3c Gadlut, the second Gadlut, the Light of Hochma (Haya), as long as she is under %0a%3c the Parsa of Atzilut in the Chazeh of AA. (How Malchut receives GAR of the %0a%3c Gadlut is explained in items 11 through 15 in the next article). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls Nukva that ascended to YESHSUT by the word MA (from %0a%3c the word Me'ah— 100), for by means of this ascent, Malchut gained the properties %0a%3c of Bina—100 blessings. And she gained the sensation of the question— she feels %0a%3c that it has only VAK (a half, a part of the big state). Put differently, she feels the %0a%3c desire for its second half, GAR. Nevertheless, she gained a part of the big state, %0a%3c VAK of AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Nukva became like YESHSUT before it raised MAN, but gained the %0a%3c properties of Bina, 100 blessings. And since this is VAK of the Light of the big %0a%3c state, she feels a deficiency (a question), just as YESHSUT felt prior to raising %0a%3c MAN— at its place, when YESHSUT was in the Katnut state. When it ascended %0a%3c to AVI, AVI ascended to AA, and ZON ascended to the place of YESHSUT AVI %0a%3c shine from the Rosh of AA on the place of YESHSUT ZON that stand there now %0a%3c feel the Light that they receive from AVI, and realize that this is merely a part of %0a%3c the Light, which generates another question within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 9. This is the secret defined by the word MA: WHAT do you testify and %0a%3c WHAT is equal to you? When the Temple was destroyed, a voice came forth %0a%3c and said, "What (MA) shall I indicate to you, and what (MA) shall I equate %0a%3c to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). However, here MA means, "What is the covenant, %0a%3c testimony, what (MA) is equal to you?" For every day testifies to you the days %0a%3c of past, as it is said: "This day I call onto Heaven and earth to witness for you" %0a%3c (Devarim, 30:19). WHAT is equal to you? It is said: "I adorned you with holy %0a%3c adornments and made you ruler of the world." And it is said: "Is this the %0a%3c city that men called the quintessence of beauty?" {Eicha, 2:15). I have called %0a%3c you, "Jerusalem, a city rebuilt by me" (Tehilim, 122:3). "What shall I equate %0a%3c to you?" (Eicha, 2:13). Just as you sit here, so He sits Above in Supernal %0a%3c Jerusalem. Just as the holy nation does not enter into you, so I swear to you %0a%3c that I will not enter Above until I enter you down below. And this is your %0a%3c consolation— that I will equate you with this degree, with Supernal Jerusalem, %0a%3c which is the Supernal Malchut (Hebrew - Kingdom) that rules over all. But %0a%3c for now you are here, and "Your misery is great, like the sea" (Eicha, 2:13). %0a%3c And if you say that there is no existence or salvation for you, then WHO (MI) %0a%3c shall heal you (not Who? with a question mark, but the Upper Force called %0a%3c WHO is what will heal you), that is, that same concealed Upper Degree, which %0a%3c is called MI, Bina that revives all, shall heal and revive you. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, MA and MI, besides being translated as WHAT and WHO, %0a%3c also designate the names of spiritual objects that perform actions described %0a%3c in The Zohar. The destruction of the Temple was the consequence of Israel's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c transgression of egoistic reception, because they did not want to raise MAN %0a%3c for the Zivug of ZON, and instead wished to receive the Light into the impure %0a%3c forces, their egoistic desires, called "other gods" (Elokim Acherim). There is %0a%3c only one Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is but one property for the Creator, and we know it— the property %0a%3c of bestowal. Drawing closer to this property is defined as working "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake." Any other desire can only mean distancing from this property %0a%3c and from the Creator, for except for this property or its opposite (rather, its %0a%3c absence), nothing else exists in creation. Hence, man's inner movement towarc %0a%3c the property of "reception" pushes him away from the Creator, and is there %0a%3c called "worshipping other gods." As a result, ZON stopped their Zivug, the %0a%3c blessings disappeared from Nukva, and the Temple was ruined. %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Temple— Malchut ascended to AVI and there receives the Light of %0a%3c Haya. Its ruin is the fall of Malchut to the level of reception of the Light GAR %0a%3c de Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Temple is Malchut 's ascension to YESHSUT and the reception %0a%3c of the Light of Neshama. In its ruin, Malchut fell to the level of reception of the %0a%3c Light of Nefesh in her Sefira Keter, while the other nine Sefirot fall below the %0a%3c Parsa. Such a state is called Galut— exile from the spiritual, from the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. The single Sefira Malchut in the world of Atzilut remains as a point below %0a%3c the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called "six days" and Malchut is called Shahhat (Saturday). Yet, is Malchut %0a%3c really bigger than ZA, as Shahhat is bigger (higher) than weekdays? The worlds %0a%3c of BYA, including our world, receive the Light, their life-force, from Malchut. %0a%3c The "six weekdays" are a state of ZON when ZA and Malchut are unconnected %0a%3c to one another. Shabbat is a state of ZON when Malchut joins with ZA, a Zivug %0a%3c takes place between them, and Malchut receives the Light from ZA and passes it %0a%3c on to the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the state of Malchut when she passes the Light received from ZA down %0a%3c to the world is important to us, by measuring our states in accordance with what %0a%3c we receive from Malchut, we define the extent of maximal reception as Shahhat. %0a%3c (Naturally, this has nothing to do with our calendar: weekdays and Shabbat are %0a%3c spiritual states that transcend time). %0a%3c %0a%3c AND A VOICE CAME FORTH AND SAID: "EACH AND EVERY DAY %0a%3c MY COVENANT HAS BEEN IN YOU SINCE THE DAYS OF PAST"- %0a%3c here, The Zohar speaks of the Light of VAK that ZON receive in the state of %0a%3c Gadlut, which Nukva receives as MA. This Light is called "the past days" (Yamim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kadmonim). Therefore, it is written in the Torah (Devarim, 4:32): "Ask now of %0a%3c the past days, which were before you, since the day the Creator created man, %0a%3c from one edge of Heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing %0a%3c as great as this?..." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of VAK of the Gadlut state is called in ZON "the past days," for %0a%3c it is VAK of AVI. YESHSUT is ZAT of AVI. ZAT is an abbreviation of the words %0a%3c Zayin (7), and Tachtonot (lower, meaning the lower Sefirot). ZAT of AVI, meaning %0a%3c the seven Sefirot of Partzuf AVI, is YESHSUT. These Zayin are seven days, the %0a%3c seven primary Sefirot of AVI with regard to Zayin, the seven days or the seven %0a%3c Sefirot of ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written, "MY COVENANT EACH AND EVERY DAY BY %0a%3c HEAVEN AND EARTH" (Devarim, 4:26). These words of the Torah speak of %0a%3c the Zivug of ZON called "Heaven" (ZA) and "earth" (Nukva). "The past days" %0a%3c or "Supernal Days" constitute YESHSUT, and "the low days" or "the present %0a%3c days" are ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this sentence, the Creator cautions that the Zivug of ZON needs to be %0a%3c constantly realized and maintained. Otherwise, the Creator warns that "you will %0a%3c disappear from the earth." And this is the meaning of the Creator's warning %0a%3c about the 100 blessings: they should be guarded and constantly created. %0a%3c %0a%3c For these 100 blessings that Nukva receives from ZA every day in the Zivug of %0a%3c MA between them take place during the ascent of ZON to YESHSUT, when ZA %0a%3c becomes like YeshS (Israel-Saba) and Nukva becomes like T (Tvunah). YESHSUT %0a%3c stands for Israel-Saba and Tvunah. And then, the Light that Nukva receives from %0a%3c ZA becomes 100 blessings, like the Light in Tvunah. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said about it, "the city that united with her," for Nukva, called "city," %0a%3c merged with Tvunah, and Nukva became like Tvunah. And Nukva receives in %0a%3c Tvunah the Light oi Tvunah, called "holy adornments," and then, like a crown of %0a%3c beauty, she surrounds the earth and receives power over the earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, as a result of Israel's transgressions (the rise of impure desires %0a%3c over the pure ones), the Temple is ruined (the Light disappeared), and Israel %0a%3c is banished from its land (fell to lower degrees). This led to the distancing of %0a%3c Nukva (all creatures) from ZA (the Creator), for the lower nine Sefirot (desires) of %0a%3c Nukva fell to the impure forces (became egoistic). In other words, the nine pure, %0a%3c altruistic desires (forces) lost their screen and became egoistic, and Nukva herself %0a%3c turned into a point that stands below the Sefira Yesod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written: "WHO SHALL REBUILD YOU AND HEAL YOU"- %0a%3c if the sons of Israel return in their aspirations to the Creator (to altruism), called %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "the return," correct their deeds (desires), and raise their prayers (MAN) for help %0a%3c in their correction to the Creator in ZON, they will once more be able to receive %0a%3c the Upper Light in ZON, Nukva will rise again to YESHSUT, called MI, and will %0a%3c be healed thereby (the Upper Light will enter Malchut, the souls, and will impart %0a%3c its properties onto them). %0a%3c %0a%3c 10. MI-WHO sets the boundary of Heaven Above— YESHSUT. MA- %0a%3c WHAT sets the boundary of Heaven below— ZA and Malchut. And this is %0a%3c what Yaakov inherited, as he is ZA that shines from end to end. From one %0a%3c boundary, which is MI, to the other boundary, which is MA. For he, Yaakov, %0a%3c stands in the middle, between YESHSUT and Malchut. Hence, it is said, %0a%3c MI BARAH ELEH: MI is YESHSUT, BARAH means created, and ELEH %0a%3c stands for ZA and Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Actually, it should rather be written, "from the beginning, i.e., from the %0a%3c Height of Heaven down to its end (lowest point) below." Yet it says, "from the %0a%3c boundary of Heaven." MI is YESHSUT that upholds everything with its question, %0a%3c the desire to receive the Light for ZON. MA is Nulcva. Before Nulcva raises MAN, %0a%3c she is the very last degree, standing below the Chazeh of ZA. Between YESHSUT %0a%3c and Nulcva stands Yaakov— ZA that clothes AA from Tabur to Malchut of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c (Atik inside of AA is unattainable) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c lower %0a%3c Sefirot %0a%3c of Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The World of Beria %0a%3c The World of Yetzira %0a%3c The World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the Worlds %0a%3c ABYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 84 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Arich Anpin is the central Partzuf in the world of Atzilut. Since Atik is %0a%3c unattainable, everything comes from AA, and all the Partzufim of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut clothe it (receive from it): Rosh de AA towers over all, and no one can %0a%3c clothe it, meaning no one can attain its thoughts and reasons for its actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c The next Partzuf is AVI. AVI clothe (attain) AA from Peh to Chazeh. Below AVI %0a%3c stands Partzuf YESHSUT, clothing AA from Chazeh to Tahur. ZA stands below %0a%3c YESHSLT and clothes AA from Tahur downwards. Partzuf ZA is incomplete, as %0a%3c he has only six Sefirot HBD-HGT or VAK; he is in the Katnut state, ending with %0a%3c his Sefira Tifferet (his Chazeh). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukm (Malchut) stands below ZA, or parallel to his last Sefira Tifferet (the %0a%3c Chazeh of ZA). She has only one Sefira Keter, whereas her nine other Sefirot %0a%3c fell below the Parsa to the worlds BYA. The entire world of Atzilut ends at %0a%3c the Chazeh of ZA, where the single Sefira of Malchut stands, who is therefore %0a%3c called a point. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our world, there is desire and its physical manifestation— action. For %0a%3c example, one wants to receive something, but he does not allow himself to %0a%3c perform the physical act of taking. Meanwhile, his desire to take remains the %0a%3c same. In the spiritual world, there are no bodies, only bare desires. Therefore, %0a%3c the desire itself already constitutes action, like an already completed mental %0a%3c and physical action in our world. Therefore, the desire alone determines man's %0a%3c spiritual state. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just imagine what it would be like if in our world we judged a person not by %0a%3c his actions, but by his desires! It is terrifying to think how distant we are from %0a%3c spiritual demands. However, our desires are determined by our spiritual degree. %0a%3c And The Zohar explains that only by raising MAN (the request for correctic %0a%3c can we attract onto us the flow of Upper Light, which will correct and elevate %0a%3c to a Higher Degree. And we will immediately begii %0a%3c that degree will evoke within us. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, our task is to attain the desire for correction. To this end, we %0a%3c need a "question," perception of our state as intolerable. This is called the %0a%3c realization of evil, i.e., that our egoism is evil, that it brings me harm by severing %0a%3c me from the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in order for this to happen, we need %0a%3c little bit of what the spiritual is and how good it is. Evil %0a%3c contrast with good. Yet, how can we sense the spiritual if we have yet to %0a%3c egoism? In what Kelim (desires) can we sense this? Even though we lack corrected %0a%3c desires, and therefore cannot sense the spiritual, as a result of studying Kabbalah, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c one begins to sense the Surrounding Light, which bestows onto him the desire %0a%3c for the spiritual (See "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c The desire of one who physically exists in our world, but spiritually exists %0a%3c in the worlds of BYA— is a desire to enjoy the Light. However, opposite these %0a%3c desires one has an "anti-desire," a screen, which neutralizes his innate will to %0a%3c receive pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c A screen is created (appears, emerges, born) within the Kli (desire, man) as a %0a%3c result of man's sensation of the spiritual Light (the Creator). Therefore, all our %0a%3c requests (prayers, MAN, "questions") should be about one thing only: for the %0a%3c Creator to grant us the strength necessary to ascend spiritually, to transform our %0a%3c desires or, as Kabbalah defines it, to acquire a screen. It is impossible to annul %0a%3c one's will to receive pleasure. The Creator created it, and it is His only creation. %0a%3c All we can do is acquire a screen (counterbalance) on it, thereby ascending above %0a%3c creation (egoism), and become similar to the Creator! And to the extent of this %0a%3c similarity, to merge with him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Partzuf Yaakov stands from MI (YESHSUT) to MA (Malchut), from %0a%3c end to end. However, what is referred to here is the state of ZON, when they %0a%3c ascend to YESHSUT and receive the Light of its degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire spiritual distance from us to the Creator is divided into 125 %0a%3c invisible degrees, all of them named. These degrees differ from one another %0a%3c only by the magnitude of their screen on man's egoistic desires. Man receives %0a%3c the Light in his corrected, altruistic desires. The volume of the received Light %0a%3c depends on the screen's magnitude (the size of the desire's corrected part). %0a%3c %0a%3c Every degree is characterized by a particular sensation of the Creator, and %0a%3c this sensation is called Light. Hence, we can designate the spiritual state of the %0a%3c Kli (man) in the spiritual world by the name of its degree or the name of the %0a%3c Light it receives, as every degree has its own particular Light. These gradations of %0a%3c the sensation of the Creator are precisely what we call spiritual degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why, having ascended to a degree called YESHSUT, ZON receive %0a%3c the Light of YESHSUT, although Partzuf YESHSUT itself ascended, accordingly, %0a%3c to a Higher Degree, and there receives the Light of that degree, called AVI. In %0a%3c turn, AVI ascend to a degree called AA, where they receive the Light of AA. We %0a%3c call degrees by the names of the Partzufim that abide there in their usual, lowest %0a%3c state. Such a state is called permanent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even though by ascending to a Higher Degree, the lower Partzuf receives %0a%3c the Light of that degree, which changes its properties, the Partzuf remains itself %0a%3c nonetheless, just as a person who acquires new properties remains a person, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c though now one of another level. Therefore, when it is said, "having ascended %0a%3c to the Upper One, the lower one becomes like him," it implies a change only in %0a%3c the inner properties of man (or Partzuf), but not in his identity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon ascending to YESHSUT, ZA receives greater Light, for an ascent %0a%3c in the spiritual world signifies an increase in the magnitude of a screen, and, %0a%3c accordingly, reception of greater Light. That is to say, ZA himself grew, but did %0a%3c not turn into YESHSUT: previously, at his own place, he had only the Light %0a%3c Ruach-Nefesh, but upon ascending and acquiring a screen, he receives the Light %0a%3c of Neskama as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the places between us and the Creator are established, and %0a%3c the Partzufim that are there "stand" on them in their permanent place. However, %0a%3c all the Partzufim and the worlds can ascend relative to their permanent, lowest %0a%3c states by one, two, or three degrees. In its lowest state, a Partzuf has only GE and %0a%3c no AHP, and only the Light of Nefesh-Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c By receiving the Light of correction from Above, the Partzuf can gradually %0a%3c correct its AHP: it corrects the Sefira Bina and receives the Light of Neshama, %0a%3c which designates an ascent of one degree. After that, the Partzuf corrects %0a%3c the Sefira ZA, and receives the Light of Haya, which designates an ascent %0a%3c to another degree, i.e., already two degrees. And after that, it corrects Sefira %0a%3c Malchut and receives the Light of Yechida, which designates an ascent to yet %0a%3c another degree, a third one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma = Eynaim %0a%3c Parsa, Nikvey Eynaim, Masach of Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina = Awzen ( ascen t of Bina to GE = ascent by 1 degree) %0a%3c ZA =Hotem (ascent of ZA to GE = ascent by 2 degrees) %0a%3c Malchut = Peh (ascent of Malchut to GE = ascent by 3 degrees) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the new Light does not enter the just corrected Kli (Sefira), but %0a%3c comes from Above and enters through the Sefira Keter. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 87 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c l« %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's spiritual ascent can be the consequence of two factors: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. An awakening of a desire from Above, called "special days"— holidays, %0a%3c new moons, Sabbaths. This kind of an ascent is called "an awakening %0a%3c from Above," and leads to the general ascent of all the worlds ABYA, %0a%3c and, consequently, of all that inhabits them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Man's efforts in his studies and inner work, his prayer to merit the Cre- %0a%3c ator personally giving him the strength to ascend to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Moreover, such an ascent is not limited to only three degrees, but can elevate %0a%3c man along all 125 degrees to the Creator Himself. Ascension to the Highest %0a%3c Degree is precisely the purpose for which man was created. He must accomplish %0a%3c this task while still living in this world. And until he attains this goal, he will %0a%3c have to return to this world again and again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although ZON are called "the last days," upon ascending and receiving the %0a%3c Light of YESHSLT, they receive the name "the days past or first days." In this %0a%3c instance, one boundary of Heaven (Malchut or MA) ascends and clothes the %0a%3c other boundary of Heaven (YESHSUT or MI). MA and MI merge in one, and %0a%3c The Zohar emphasizes that fact. AND KNOW: %0a%3c %0a%3c Ml - WHO %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BARAH - CREATED %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ELEH - THIS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MI is YESHSUT that stands in the place of Bina de AA, from Chazeh to Tabur %0a%3c de AA. And although only Kelim of GE (vessels of bestowal) are present in the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, there are Partzufirn among them that wish only to "bestow": %0a%3c Atik, AA, AVI, and those that want to receive for the sake of bestowal, so as to %0a%3c pass the Light on to YESHSUT and ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c AA > These 3 Partzufirn form GE of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA ) These 3 Partzufirn form AHP of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT and ZON want to receive the Light so as to pass it to the souls of %0a%3c the righteous, the people who seek correction. Hence, within the world of Atzilut %0a%3c there is a division into two types of Kelim— GE and AHP. They are separated from %0a%3c each other by the Parsa of the world of Atzilut that stands in the Chazeh of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c Rosh %0a%3c -Peh — %0a%3c %0a%3c Chazeh - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c -Tabur — %0a%3c Raglaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World %0a%3c of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa between %0a%3c Atzilut and the %0a%3c Worlds BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light from the Rosh de AA does not pass below the Parsa of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut. Therefore, YESHSUT in its permanent state, or ZON, when they ascend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 89 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to YESHSUT, cannot receive the Light of Rosh de AA. This is why they have the %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Hochma, called "question." The question (desire %0a%3c to receive the Light of Hochma) therefore amounts to MI (YESHSUT, the Light %0a%3c of YESHSUT), which is BARAH (beyond ELEH-ZON), and upon their ascent, %0a%3c ZON do not receive the Light of Hochma, as they are outside the Rosh of AA, %0a%3c outside of the Light of Hochma, but with a question (a desire for it). This enables %0a%3c them to continue their ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 11. Rabbi Shimon said: "Elazar, my son, reveal the supernal secret, which %0a%3c the dwellers of this world know nothing about." Rabbi Elazar was silent. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon wept and paused for a moment, and then said, "Elazar, what %0a%3c is ELEH?" If you say that they are like the stars and the signs of the zodiac %0a%3c (destiny), are they not always visible (unlike the changeable signs of destiny)? %0a%3c And in MA, that is in Malchut, they were created as it is written, "By the %0a%3c word of the Creator were the Heavens made" (Tehilim, 33:6), meaning that %0a%3c the Heavens were made by Mcdchut, called the Creator's word. And if ELEH %0a%3c speak of the hidden secrets, then there would be no need to write ELEH, as %0a%3c the stars and the signs of destinies are visible to all (the word ELEH (THIS) %0a%3c tells us that something is clear). %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar did not reveal the reception of the Light of the first Gadlut %0a%3c state (Ohr Neshama), and Rabbi Shimon wished to reveal the way to receive the %0a%3c Light of the second Gadlut state (Ohr Haya). Therefore, he asked Rabbi Elazar %0a%3c to speak and to reveal the way to attain Ohr Neshama, which is concealed from %0a%3c people by a supernal secret, for this Light has not yet been revealed in the world, %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon reveals it here. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fact is that, although there were righteous who attained the Light of %0a%3c Haya, there was no one among them who could explain the path of its attainment %0a%3c in detail, no one who could reveal it to the entire world. This is so because to %0a%3c understand means to attain, to ascend to that degree, which depends only on %0a%3c man's efforts. While there were many people throughout the generations who %0a%3c attained the degree of ELEH, revealing it to the world requires an even greater %0a%3c degree, and a special permission by the Creator (See the article The Conditions %0a%3c for Disclosing the Secrets of the Wisdom of Kabbalah). %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon asked him what ELEH means, what new things is the Torah %0a%3c telling us with the words, MI BARAH ELEH (WHO CREATED THESE), where %0a%3c %0a%3c 91 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 92 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word ELEH designates ZON? After all, if it speaks of the stars and the signs %0a%3c of the zodiac— luck, which signify the Light of VAK of the big state, then what %0a%3c is so special about it? After all, ZON can receive this Light even on weekdays. %0a%3c There is nothing so extraordinary in this to mention MI - WHO CREATED %0a%3c THIS separately. %0a%3c %0a%3c (One might say that this Light is constant, for only the Light of VAK is %0a%3c constantly present in ZON, but not GAR. And only as a result of MAN does %0a%3c ZON receive the Light of VAK of the big state, the Light of Neshama. The answer %0a%3c lies in that this Light can be received at any time, even on weekdays during the %0a%3c morning prayer. However, he still does not understand why these were created %0a%3c in MA. After all, Light refers not to Bina, but to the ZON of the world of At^ilut, %0a%3c called MA, and exits them, as is written BY THE WORD OF THE CREATOR, %0a%3c where the Creator is ZA and His word is Malchut.) %0a%3c %0a%3c 12. However, this secret was revealed on another day, when I was on the %0a%3c seashore. The prophet Eliyahu came to me and said: "Rabbi, do you know %0a%3c the meaning of MI BARAH ELEH - WHO HAS CREATED THESE?" I %0a%3c answered: "These are the Heavens and its forces, the works of the Creator, %0a%3c looking at which, people should bless Him, as it is said, 'When I behold Your %0a%3c Heavens, the work of Your hands' (Tehilim, 8:4), and 'O LORD! Our Lord! %0a%3c How glorious is Your name throughout all the earth!'" (Tehilim, 8:10). %0a%3c %0a%3c 13. He replied to me: "Rabbi, the Creator took the concealed and revealed it %0a%3c to the Celestial Council. And here it is: When the most Concealed of all that %0a%3c are Concealed desired to reveal Himself, He first made a single point, which %0a%3c is Mcdchut, and it ascended to His Thought, that is, into Bina, meaning that %0a%3c MalcHwt ascended and merged with Bina. In her, He shaped all the creatures, %0a%3c and in her confirmed all the laws." %0a%3c %0a%3c Atilc is the first Partzuf and the Rosh of the world of Atzilut. And it is called %0a%3c the most concealed and secret of all the Partzufim, and its name— Atilc (from the %0a%3c word Ne'etok— isolated, unattainable) testifies to that fact. No one can attain %0a%3c this Partzuf in itself, its properties, but we can attain it the way it appears to %0a%3c us: Atilc deliberately diminishes and changes itself in such a way that the lower %0a%3c ones could attain the outer form (its properties) in which it appears to them, %0a%3c but not Atilc itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the words of The Zohar, when Atilc wished to reveal itself to the worlds, %0a%3c although it is a Partzuf that acts according to the laws of the first restriction, it %0a%3c "clothed itself in the garments" (an external Partzuf that acts according to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 93 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c laws of the second restriction) with regard to the lower ones so as to enable them %0a%3c to perceive and attain it. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is an enormous difference between the properties of the sensory %0a%3c organs that perceive sensations of the first and the second restrictions. Just as %0a%3c man in our world is born without sensory organs that can perceive spiritual %0a%3c worlds, which is why he cannot sense them, so is the Partzuf that is corrected %0a%3c for the conditions of spiritual work at the level of the second restriction unable %0a%3c to accept (perceive) the Light that descends according to the law of the first %0a%3c restriction. A similar distinction exists between Partzuf Atik and the other %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut and the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c To be connected to the lower ones, Atik elevated Malchut de Rosh de AA %0a%3c within the Rosh of the lower-standing AA up to the Sefira Hochma. As a result, %0a%3c Sefirot Bina and ZON de Rosh de AA fell from the Rosh of AA to its Guf. After %0a%3c all, Malchut ascended from the Peh to the Eynaim and stood in the Rosh at place %0a%3c of Bina, whereas Bina and ZON exited the Rosh. The Guf (body) begins after %0a%3c Malchut de Rosh (after the decision on how to act), wherever it may be. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here is how one should understand this: the Sefirot of the Rosh are the %0a%3c thoughts and desires with regards to which the Partzuf, man's inner properties %0a%3c (man himself) makes the decisions as to how they can be used in order to advance %0a%3c as much as possible toward the goal of creation. The fact that Sefirot Bina and %0a%3c ZON exited the Rosh of AA means that Partzuf AA cannot make any decisions %0a%3c with regard to them for lack of a screen on them. This is why they fell into the %0a%3c Guf, outside the Rosh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, their remaining role is only to receive the Light from the Rosh, just %0a%3c as it is received by all the Sefirot of the Guf. In other words, they receive the Light %0a%3c that is accepted by the screen of Sefirot Keter and Hochma that remained in the %0a%3c Rosh. Man deliberately restricts the use of his desires, and uses only those desires %0a%3c with which he can work for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when Malchut ascended and stood under the Sefira Hochma, %0a%3c Hochma became like the male part (bestowing, fulfilling), and Malchut became %0a%3c like the female (receiving) part of the Rosh. And since Malchut took the place of %0a%3c Bina (called "thought"), Malchut assumed the name "thought," since now it's %0a%3c Malchut that makes a Zivug and receives Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Partzuf that receives from Hochma is defined as Bina, and not Malchut. %0a%3c Therefore, although Malchut herself is merely a black point (egoistic creature), as %0a%3c a result of her ascent, she becomes Bina, i.e., Malchut acquires Bina's properties. %0a%3c Hence, Malchut is now called Bina or "thought." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 94 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls a "thought" either to Hochma or to Bina. The difference is %0a%3c that a thought is something that is received from Hochma. Hence, Bina is called %0a%3c a thought only if she is in the Rosh and receives the Light from Hochma. In %0a%3c the first restriction, Bina always receives from Hochma, and is called "thought." %0a%3c However, in the second restriction, Malchut ascended above Bina and started %0a%3c receiving from Hochma. That is why it is Malchut that is now called "thought," %0a%3c and not Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Partzufim of the worlds of ABYA are created by this ascent of Malchut %0a%3c to Bina. Therefore, it is written: IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, %0a%3c AND IN HER CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS-Se/irot Keter and Hochma %0a%3c remained in the Rosh of each Partzuf, and a Zivug was made on these two Sefirot. %0a%3c This is why the Light received in Guf of the Partzuf consists of only two Lights, %0a%3c Ne/esh and Ruach. %0a%3c %0a%3c Previously, Malchut stood in Peh de Rosh and the Rosh (the part of the Partzuf %0a%3c in which it calculated how much Light it can receive for the Creator's sake) %0a%3c ended there. Then, the Partzuf would receive that Light from the Rosh to the %0a%3c Guf, between the Peh and the Tahur. %0a%3c %0a%3c But now Malchut ascended to Eynaim de Rosh and stands under them. This %0a%3c is known as the ascent of Malchut to NE (Nikvey Eynaim - pupils of the eyes), %0a%3c which are called NE precisely because Nikvey Eynaim means Malchut of the eyes. %0a%3c Prior to Malchut's ascent to the Eynaim, it was as though there were no pupils %0a%3c (NE). It is worth noting that only in Malchut (desire) can we feel what surrounds %0a%3c us (the Creator, Light). This is why all of our sensory organs are designed as %0a%3c apertures: Nekev (orifice), Nukva, Malchut in the eyes, Awznaim (ears), Hotem %0a%3c (nose) and Peh (mouth). %0a%3c %0a%3c Only he who can create desires that work according to the principle of the %0a%3c second restriction through his own strength and effort, and puts Malchut after %0a%3c er-Hochma (thinks in terms of bestowal), can start perceiving through tl %0a%3c ted spiritual sensory organ. Wherever there is a screen, it constitutes %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon her ascent, Malchut stood under Hochma and made a Zivug on her %0a%3c own screen, on Sefirot Keter-Hochma (GE). Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut (AHP) are %0a%3c located below the Rosh, in the Guf of the Partzuf, and passively receive the Light %0a%3c from the Rosh. This leads to a division of the ten Sefirot of the Guf, KHB-ZA-M, %0a%3c in the same way the ten Sefirot of the Rosh were divided: Sefirot K-H of the Guf %0a%3c continue receiving from K-H of the Rosh, and Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Guf, being %0a%3c unable to receive from the Rosh, start receiving from K-H of the Guf, like the %0a%3c Sefirot below the Tahur of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 95 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As is well-known, every Partzuf consists of a Rosh, a Guf, and extremities. %0a%3c The Rosh decides how much Light the Guf can receive for the Creator's sake, in %0a%3c accordance with the magnitude of the screen that reflects the Light (pleasure). %0a%3c The decision to accept this Light causes the Light to descend through the screen, %0a%3c from the Rosh to the Guf, filling it from the Peh down to the Tahur. Each Sefira %0a%3c of the Rosh fills its corresponding Sefira in the Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf in the 1 st Restriction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Head %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Body %0a%3c Tabur %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 Parts of the Extremities %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf in the 2 nd Restriction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Body %0a%3c %0a%3c Tabur %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 Parts of the Extremities %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parts outside of Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 96 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c If there are only two Sefirot K-H in the Rosh, then only the two Sefirot K-H %0a%3c remain in the Guf. This is because only they can receive from the corresponding %0a%3c Sefirot in the Rosh. Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh receive the same Light as Sefirot K-H %0a%3c of the Guf, which means that they are located under the screen (Malchut that %0a%3c ascends and stands under Hochma de Rosh). Thus, the Guf contains K-H that %0a%3c receive, accordingly, the Lights Ruach-Nefesh, and AHP of the Rosh that receive %0a%3c these two Lights of Ruach-Nefesh, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c B-ZA-M (AHP) of the Guf cannot receive the Light from the Rosh, as their %0a%3c corresponding Sefirot B-ZA-M of the Rosh do not participate in a Zivug, since they %0a%3c lack the strength of the screen sufficient to reflect the egoistic desires of AHP %0a%3c de Rosh so as to receive for the Creator's sake. In other words, since there are %0a%3c no AHP in the Rosh, there are also no AHP in the Guf. And since AHP de Guf %0a%3c receive no Light from AHP de Rosh, they are like the extremities— the end of a %0a%3c Partzuf, below its Tabur. Hence, at the end of a Partzuf, below Tahur, there are GE %0a%3c of Raglaim (feet) and AHP de Guf, which fell there. And AHP of Raglaim are not %0a%3c parts of a Partzuf whatsoever, as they are located at a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that cannot be received by the Partzuf remains outside, surrounding %0a%3c it, and waits until the Partzuf acquires the strength to receive it. It is called %0a%3c "Surrounding Light," and it corresponds to the desires that do not take part in %0a%3c a Zivug, those desires that are still uncorrected and lack a screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, previously, before the second restriction, Malchut (the last Sefira of the %0a%3c Guf) was in Tahur, now, when only two Sefirot K-H remain in the Guf, Malchut de %0a%3c Guf, too, ascends to Bina de Guf, called Chazeh. Therefore, when Malchut ascends %0a%3c to Bina de Rosh, the entire Partzuf "diminishes" in size: the Rosh reaches only up %0a%3c to the Eynaim, the Guf only to the Chazeh, and the Raglaim only to Tabur. And %0a%3c that is why this state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Katnut." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if the Partzuf receives new strength from Above, acquires a Masach %0a%3c (screen), it will be able to resolve to accept the Light for the Creator's sake in its %0a%3c AHP, then AHP de Rosh will rise again from the Guf to the Rosh, and complete the %0a%3c Rosh to ten Sefirot, while the Sefirot of AHP de Guf will ascend from the Raglaim back %0a%3c to their place in order to receive additional Light. And then Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim %0a%3c will all contain ten Sefirot. This state of the Partzuf is called "the state of Gadlut." %0a%3c %0a%3c In the language of The Zohar, the restriction of a Partzuf, its transition from %0a%3c the Gadlut state to the Katnut state is described as a division of each part of the %0a%3c Partzuf (Rosh, Guf, and Raglaim) into GE (MI) and AHP (ELEH). All ten Sefirot %0a%3c are called by the Creator's name Elokim, which consists of the letters ELEH- %0a%3c IM, that are further divided into MI - GE - K-H and ELEH - B-ZA-M. When %0a%3c in Katnut, only Sefirot ELEH maintain their degree, whereas Sefirot IM fall to a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 97 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower degree. The word Elokim is read from below upwards, the way they are %0a%3c attained by man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Partzuf %0a%3c %0a%3c in the Big State in the Small State %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M-K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M-K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 -H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 -H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E -B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c E -B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c L- ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c !

EH - M ; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN HER HE SHAPED ALL THE CREATURES, AND IN HER %0a%3c CONFIRMED ALL THE LAWS— alludes to the division of each degree into two %0a%3c parts; their new form signifies the division into ELEH and MI, the separation %0a%3c of the Kelim (desires) of "bestowal" and "reception," where, due to the lack of %0a%3c strength to oppose one's nature (egoism), part of the Sefirot (desires) remain %0a%3c unused, outside of their degree. Accordingly, their Light remains outside as %0a%3c Ohr Makif (Surrounding Light), and waits until the Partzuf acquires additional %0a%3c strength to become big and thus receive all the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the 6,000 years, our entire correction transpires only according to %0a%3c the laws of T?imt?um Bet (second restriction). As soon as the Partzuf acquires new %0a%3c strength (Masach) to receive the Light selflessly in Sefirot/ Kelim B-ZA-M (ELEH), %0a%3c it will immediately attach them to itself and receive in them the Lights Neshama- %0a%3c Haya-Yechida. And it will grow to become a big Partzuf consisting of five Kelim %0a%3c (ten Sefirot) with the five Lights of NRNHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14. He confirmed in the sacred and concealed candle (in Malchut that %0a%3c merged with Bina), a concealed image, the Holy of Holies, a secret structure %0a%3c that emerges from the thought, QAR that is called MI, which is the beginning %0a%3c of this structure. It stands and it does not stand; it is great and concealed in %0a%3c the name Elokim (ELEH and IM). It is called MI from the word Elokim, %0a%3c that is, it lacks the letters ELEH of the name Elokim. He desired to be %0a%3c revealed and called by the complete name Elokim, so He clothed Himself %0a%3c in a splendid shining garment, the Light of Hassadim. He created ELEH. %0a%3c The letters ELEH of the name Elokim ascended and combined with the %0a%3c letters MI and formed the complete name Elokim. And until He created %0a%3c ELEH, He did not rise (did not ascend) to the name Elokim. Hence, those %0a%3c who sinned by worshipping the Golden Calf alluded to this secret by saying, %0a%3c "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!" (Shemot, 32:4). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 98 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "ELEH (this is) your God, Israel!"— that is, these egoistic desires (ELEH) are %0a%3c your deity, which you must worship until you correct yourself. The use of ELEH %0a%3c is the reason for all transgressions and ruin: the breaking of the vessels (Kelim), %0a%3c the sin of Adam and the shattering of his soul into 600,000 pieces, worshipping %0a%3c the Golden Calf and the breaking of the Tablets by Moshe, the ruin of the First %0a%3c and Second Temples, and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the lower ones raising MAN, meaning their request to %0a%3c receive the strength necessary to make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma for %0a%3c the Creator's sake, there descends from Above the Light called MAD (Mayin %0a%3c Dechurin)-the force that enables the Kli to create a Masach capable of reflecting %0a%3c Light, thereby resisting its egoistic nature. This force comes in the form of %0a%3c Light, the sensation of the Creator's greatness, and is referred to as the Light of %0a%3c AB-SAG, as it descends from the Partzufim Hochma (AB) and Bina (SAG) of the %0a%3c world of AK (Adam Kadmon). %0a%3c %0a%3c If one ascends from the degree called "our world" to the worlds BYA, then %0a%3c wherever he may be in those worlds, his request for spiritual correction will rise %0a%3c through all the worlds and degrees up to Partzuf SAG. SAG turns to AB, receives %0a%3c the Light of Hochma from it, and passes it down to all the Partzufim along which %0a%3c MAN had ascended. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the entire world of AK exists in the first restriction (Tzimtzum Aleph) %0a%3c and above the second restriction (Tzimtzum Bet), the Light that comes from %0a%3c it provides the Kli that receives this Light with the strength to pass from the %0a%3c small state to the big one. In other words, the Light of AB-SAG enables the Kli %0a%3c to create a Masach, reflect the Light of Hochma, and receive it for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. The Gadlut state is called "the holy of holies," for being filled with the %0a%3c Light of GAR (the holy of holies) is utterly perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of AB-SAG first descends to the Rosh of Partzuf AA and lowers %0a%3c the point (Malchut) from the thought (Bina) back to its place in the Peh, where %0a%3c it was prior to Tzimtzum Bet. In consequence, the three Sefirot B-ZA-M rejoin the %0a%3c two Sefirot KH and become five Sefirot in the Rosh, AHP (ELEH) ascend and join %0a%3c with GE (MI), and the Creator's name Elokim is completed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this does not mean that the Partzuf can be filled with the five %0a%3c Lights NRNHY; it merely acquires a Masach, the strength to receive the Light %0a%3c in all its ten Sefirot. Since only Ohr Hochma shines in AA, this Light cannot %0a%3c fill the elevated Kelim of ELEH, as they can only receive Ohr Hochma if it is %0a%3c clothed by Ohr Hassadim. Only the GAR of the Partzuf (K-H-B) can have pure %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; the ZAT of the Partzuf (Sefirot ZA-M) can only receive diminished %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Created These (by Eliyahu) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 99 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma— half-mixed with Ohr Hassadim. This is called the reception of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in the middle line (consisting of half Hochma and half Hassadim). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, says The Zohar, THIS STRUCTURE STANDS AND IT DOES %0a%3c NOT STAND— even though all the Sefirot are already present in the Rosh, %0a%3c they still need to be filled with Light, meaning that Sefirot ELEH are not yet %0a%3c revealed in the name Elokim. Only the letters MI have so far been revealed %0a%3c (filled with the Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, first, the Partzuf makes a Zivug on its Katnut state and receives Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. Then, it clothes Ohr Hochma into PRECIOUS GARMENT (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim). Only afterwards can the mixed Light of Hassadim and Hochma fill %0a%3c Sefirot ZAT (ELEH), and all five Sefirot will shine in perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, before MI gives Ohr Hassadim to ELEH so as to enable ELEH %0a%3c to receive Ohr Hochma in it, ELEH cannot receive Ohr Hochma, and only the %0a%3c Light of MI shines in the entire name Elokim. Further, The Zohar tells us that %0a%3c neglect of Ohr Hassadim (the intention for the Creator's sake) is precisely what %0a%3c constitutes the entire transgression. And since they transgressed, i.e., neglected %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, that is, since they did not wish to receive with the intention "for %0a%3c the Creator's sake," but desired only Ohr Hochma, they caused the separation %0a%3c of MI from ELEH. Hence, it is written, ELEH - THIS (the desires of reception %0a%3c and not MI, the desires of bestowal) IS YOUR LORD, ISRAEL-and the Light %0a%3c instantly passed to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah does not tell us about the history of an ancient nation, but %0a%3c about the structure of the spiritual degrees that we must attain. To know the %0a%3c properties of these degrees (whose attainment is designated by the acquisition %0a%3c of their properties), Kabbalah explains to us how they were originally created by %0a%3c a gradual descent (spiritual coarsening) from the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And in order to give us an opportunity to correct our egoism, the Creator %0a%3c mixed it with altruism at the very creation of the spiritual degrees. This kind %0a%3c of mixing of opposite properties is possible only through an "explosion," since %0a%3c opposite properties cannot be combined otherwise. There were several such %0a%3c mixtures that occurred as a result of explosions (breaking of properties). %0a%3c %0a%3c One of them is mentioned in the Torah (Shemot, 32:4), when, by worshiping %0a%3c the Golden Calf, the sons of Israel (the altruistic desires of "bestowal") suddenly %0a%3c wished to receive the Light for themselves. Consequently, the Sefirot (Kelim) of %0a%3c GE and AHP mixed together, and the properties (desires) of GE penetrated %0a%3c AHP. Through these altruistic properties that are secretly concealed within a %0a%3c small, egoistic human being, it is possible to awaken him, to evoke in him an %0a%3c aspiration to ascend spiritually and to disregard this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ved %0a%3c iin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;refore, everything that is written in the Torah should not be percer %0a%3c lot as history, but as an instruction manual. All the actions described %0a%3c the Torah are positive: all the devastations, including the ruin of the First and %0a%3c the Second Temples, wars, adultery and murder. We only need to realize what %0a%3c exactly the Torah is telling us. And one can understand it correctly only if he %0a%3c stops perceiving it as a collection of injunctions referring to the mechanical %0a%3c performance of commandments. %0a%3c %0a%3c 15. Just as MI join ELEH into one name Elokim, when Hochma clothes itself %0a%3c in Hassadim, so is the name combined by this precious shining garment. %0a%3c The world exists thanks to this secret, as is written, "The world was created %0a%3c by mercy." (Tehilim, 89:3). Then Eliyahu flew away, and I did not see him %0a%3c anymore. Yet, it is from him that I discovered that I stood upon the secret and %0a%3c its concealment. Rabbi Elazar approached with the others, and they bowed %0a%3c down before him. They wept and said, "If we have come into this world %0a%3c only to hear this— it is enough for us!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon continues his explanation: There is only one law of reception %0a%3c of Ohr Hochma: Ohr Hochma can only be received if Ohr Hassadim clothes it %0a%3c beforehand. Just as this occurs in Partzuf Bina, called "the Upper World," so %0a%3c does it occur in Partzuf Malchut (MA, ~Nukva of ZA), called "the lower world." %0a%3c Malchut is typically referred to as BON, but when she joins ZA and receives the %0a%3c Light from him, she is called by his name— MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper World, Bina of the world of Atzilut, desires only Hassadim, %0a%3c but the lower world, Malchut of the world of Atzilut, wants Hochma. However, %0a%3c Eliyahu the prophet spoke only of the order of Light and the structure of the %0a%3c name Elokim in AVI (Bina de Atzilut), whereas Rabbi Shimon continues his %0a%3c explanation in the next article and describes the structure and reception of %0a%3c Light in the name Elokim in Malchut de Atzilut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes %0a%3c to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 16. Heaven, Earth, and all that inhabit them were created by MA, which is %0a%3c Malchut, as it is said: "When I behold your Heavens, the work of your hands" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 8:4). And before this, it is said, "MA - WHAT (How) majestic Your %0a%3c name is throughout the earth, which You established above the Heavens" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 8:2). After all, the Heavens were created by the name (property) %0a%3c MA (Malchut). It is written "in the Heavens," which refers to Bina, called %0a%3c MI, the Heavens that are above ZA. The explanation for this lies in the name %0a%3c Elokim. MA (Malchut) ascends and enters with her properties into Bina, %0a%3c i.e., connects into Bina, and receives her properties. Bina is called Elokim. %0a%3c After He CREATED LIGHT FOR LIGHT, meaning Ohr (Light) Hassadim %0a%3c (called "precious adornments or garments") so as to clothe Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma, which signifies the creation of Light for %0a%3c Light; by the force of the Supernal Name Elokim (Bina), Malchut ascends, %0a%3c and, upon joining Bina, receives all of her properties, and includes herself in %0a%3c Bina. Therefore, BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the %0a%3c Creator created) refers to the Supernal Elokim, to Bina and not to Malchut. %0a%3c For MA (Malchut) is not created by the name MI ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower world (Malchut, MA) receives the Light (marked from Above %0a%3c by the name Elokim) from Bina. This Light brings Malchut strength, and the %0a%3c properties suitable for the creation of Heaven, earth, and posterity manifest %0a%3c within her. After all, there cannot be any posterity or birth of new generations %0a%3c without the Light of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is what The Zohar tells us: so does the lower world (Malchut, MA) %0a%3c exist by the name Elokim, by the name from the Upper World, which is why %0a%3c %0a%3c 101 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 102 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c there's strength in Malchut (Ohr Hochma) to create generations. And if Malchut %0a%3c has Ohr Hochma, then the world can be created by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c (Haya is one type of Ohr Hochma. There is one Light that the Creator %0a%3c emanates, or rather, the sensation of the Creator we refer to as Light. This %0a%3c sensation depends on the desires-Kelim in which we feel Him. And since there %0a%3c are only two types of desires-Kelim, those of "bestowal" and those of "reception," %0a%3c there exist only two types of Light, Hassadim and Hochma. However, each of %0a%3c them includes several subtypes, and Ohr Haya constitutes a particular form of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. This is because Hochma is the Light or pleasure that is felt by the %0a%3c will "to receive," whereas Hassadim is the pleasure that is felt by the will "to %0a%3c bestow." If only the Kelim of bestowal (GE) are present in the Partzuf, it is filled %0a%3c with Ohr Hassadim; and if it has the strength to receive for the Creator's sake, it %0a%3c is filled with Ohr Hochma.) (Do not confuse this with MA, which is used here, %0a%3c where MA = Malchut with ZA = MA in Gematria). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar explains that the Light descends from the name Elokim thanks %0a%3c to the merging of MI and ELEH. ZA is called "Heaven." YESHSUT is above %0a%3c Heaven (ZA). There is no MI in Heaven (ZA), only MA. However, after Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim clothes Ohr Hochma (the Light ELEH = AHP clothes the Light of MA %0a%3c = GE), all the letters combine and ascend by the name Elokim above Heaven = %0a%3c ZA = MA to YESHSUT = Bina = MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c MI (Bina) is above the second restriction, above its ban, as her properties %0a%3c are higher, better than those to which the restriction extends: the property %0a%3c of Bina is "not to receive anything," which is why the ban of the second %0a%3c restriction— to not receive— simply does not apply to her, for in her essence, %0a%3c she has no desire to receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c There remains only the ban of T^imt^um Alef>h, the restriction imposed on %0a%3c the reception of Light in Malchut herself (Malchut de Malchut), the central point %0a%3c of all creation, the only creating being. Malchut herself is egoistic, but if she has %0a%3c a Masach and only receives the Light by means of a Zivug de Hakaa (resistance %0a%3c to one's own desire, only for the Creator's sake) on the desires of bestowal, such %0a%3c reception does not occur in Malchut, but rather in the first nine Sefirot. Hence, %0a%3c Malchut can receive the Light in her first nine Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, if Malchut has the will (strength) to receive (enjoy) the Light %0a%3c (pleasure) not for herself, but only because the Creator so desires, then she %0a%3c receives only this amount of Light (pleasure). In order to receive the Light under %0a%3c such a condition, Malchut (man's inclination to pleasure and enjoyment) must %0a%3c first reject all incoming pleasure, which Malchut perceives to be right there before %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 103 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c her. This is referred to as the Light's (the pleasure's) impact against the screen %0a%3c and its reflection off the screen (the reflection of pleasure by force of will so as %0a%3c to not receive, in spite of the natural, primordial desire to receive pleasure). %0a%3c %0a%3c The reflected pleasure is called Ohr Hassadim. Essentially, this is not a Light, %0a%3c but rather Malchut's intention to receive only for the Creator's sake. However, %0a%3c this intention is that necessary and sufficient condition for the subsequent %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma from the Creator. For after Malchut repelled all the %0a%3c Light (expressed her intention to not receive for her own sake), she thereby %0a%3c met the condition of Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) to only receive the Light %0a%3c of Hochma in the intention for the Creator's sake, which is called Ohr Hozer %0a%3c (Returning Light) or Ohr Hassadim. And now she can receive Ohr Hochma, the %0a%3c pleasure that the Creator wants to bestow upon her. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, by receiving this Light, Malchut is no more a mere recipient- %0a%3c creature. Now, like the Creator, she bestows pleasure upon Him! In this %0a%3c manner, the creature attains the degree of the Creator, becomes equal to Him %0a%3c in properties, for it wants to bestow everything. This is called "being filled with %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim." Moreover, Malchut receives and enjoys, for if she does not feel %0a%3c pleasure, she will not please the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut receives, meaning she is filled with Ohr Hochma, full of %0a%3c wisdom and pleasure, from both bestowal and reception for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c And herein lies the perfection of the Creator's Creation: she becomes perfect %0a%3c and similar to the Creator. And this is the perfection of the Creator's works: His %0a%3c creation can ascend to His level independently! %0a%3c %0a%3c One can imagine one's path from the lows of our world up to the ultimate %0a%3c spiritual peak— the Creator— as a passage through a suite of rooms. In all, %0a%3c between our state and the Creator there are 125 connected, walkthrough %0a%3c rooms. Each room has its own properties, and only those who possess the same %0a%3c properties can be there. If, regardless of reason, man changes his properties, %0a%3c he is automatically moved as though by an invisible current to a room that %0a%3c corresponds to his new properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is how one can move between these rooms: an infinitesimal inner %0a%3c change of properties evokes influence of a spiritual force-field upon man, %0a%3c immediately moves to his new place of equilibrium, where his inne %0a%3c completely coincide with the external properties of the spiri %0a%3c ce, there are no guards at the rooms' entrances/ exits; as soon as %0a%3c es himself so as to match the properties of the next, higher room, he is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 104 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pleasure %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s the %0a%3c Lse %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c What properties must one change in order to move from one rc %0a%3c another within this spiritual field? He only needs to alter the type of pie %0a%3c to which he aspires. We cannot help receiving pleasure, for such is the entire %0a%3c material of creation, it is all that was created. However, we can change the object %0a%3c of our aspirations, what it is that we wish to enjoy: either coarse reception, %0a%3c reception of mere necessities, or the Creator being pleased with us that we %0a%3c bestow to Him, that we receive because such is His wish. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our "I," the entity that feels pleasure is present in all of our desires, which %0a%3c ange ceaselessly in terms of both magnitude and the desired object. %0a%3c vex disappears. The only thing of which one should rid himself is %0a%3c sensation that he does something to please this "I." One should aspire to sense %0a%3c the desires of the Creator, how He is pleased with him (just as a mother %0a%3c pleased with her son's achievements). %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut decides to receive only for the Creator's sake, i.e., according %0a%3c to the force of her Masach (the force of resistance to her egoistic will to receive %0a%3c pleasure), she receives Ohr Hochma only in accordance with the magnitude of %0a%3c the Returning Light. Or, conversely, one may say that the magnitude of the %0a%3c Returning Light determines man's willpower and his desire to act for the %0a%3c Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the first nine of Malchut's ten Sefirot are not egoistic, as they are %0a%3c the Creator's properties with which He wishes to correct Malchut. Only the last %0a%3c Sefira of Malchut, Malchut herself, the single creation, called Malchut de Malchut, %0a%3c is egoistic and remains under the ban of the first restriction: Ohr Hochma does %0a%3c not enter where the will to receive pleasure is present. Therefore, the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot can receive the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after the second restriction, in order to correct Malchut and impart %0a%3c the properties of mercy (Hassadim) onto her so she would be able to desire to %0a%3c "bestow," acquire the properties of Bina, and convert her initial, primordial %0a%3c egoism into altruism, Malchut ascended to Partzuf Aha, became Malchut in %0a%3c Partzuf Aha in Bina 's place, while Bina found herself below Malchut. Bina herself %0a%3c can receive Ohr Hochma without any restrictions, even when below Malchut. %0a%3c However, Bina adopted the limitations of Tzimtzum Bet for the sole purpose of %0a%3c correcting Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, due to the MAN raised by the lower ones, by man's requests for %0a%3c spiritual correction, the Light AB-SAG descends and lowers Malchut from the %0a%3c level of Bina back to her own place: Malchut descends from Bina, and the Light %0a%3c of attainment and wisdom is revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 105 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's descent, Bina purifies herself from all restrictions and %0a%3c limitations and returns to receiving Ohr Hochma. And after the Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c clothes the Ohr Hochma, MI shines in ELEH and the name Elokim is revealed, %0a%3c meaning that Ohr Hochma shines. %0a%3c %0a%3c The structure of the name Elokim cannot be found in MA, for the lower %0a%3c boundary of Heaven (Malchut herself) is limited by Tzimtzum Aleph— the ban %0a%3c imposed on the reception of Ohr Hochma, and by Tzimtzum Bet's 6,000-year long %0a%3c prohibition on the usage of the desires of reception. Hence, The Zohar tells us %0a%3c that the name Elokim was created with MI, and not with MA, by the property %0a%3c received by Malchut upon her ascent to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17. But as the letters ELEH descend from Above, from Bina down to Malchut, %0a%3c for the mother temporarily lends her clothes to her daughter and adorns her %0a%3c with her own adornments, the name Elokim descends from Bina (mother) %0a%3c to Malchut (daughter). When does she adorn her with her own adornments? %0a%3c When she sees the male essence before her. It is then written of her, "Three %0a%3c times in the year shall all your males appear before the Lord Creator" (Shemot, %0a%3c 34:23). For Malchut is then called by the male name "Master." As it is written: %0a%3c "Behold the Ark of the Union, the Master of all the earth" (Yehoshua, 3:11). %0a%3c The Torah is the Union and the Ark is Malchut, called by the male name %0a%3c "Master." For she received the Kelim (properties, desires) called "clothes," %0a%3c and the Light called "adornments" from her mother, Bina. The letter Hey %0a%3c (A from MA) then leaves MA (Mem + Hey) and the letter Yod (I) enters in %0a%3c its stead, and just like Bina, Malchut assumes the name MI. And then she %0a%3c adorns herself with male clothes, with the clothes of Bina, to accept all the %0a%3c husbands of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is written (item 13), Tzimtzum Bet is in force from the Rosh of AA %0a%3c downwards, for Malchut of AA ascended to Bina and created all the lower %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut in the property of Tzimtzum Bet. Thus, each %0a%3c Partzuf of AA, AVI and ZON has only two Sefirot K-H, and three Sefirot B-ZA-M %0a%3c separated themselves (their properties) from that degree, and moved to a lower %0a%3c one (their properties became equal to it). This is how B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf %0a%3c AA) fell to Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf AVI, B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf AVI) fell to %0a%3c Sefirot K-H (GE) of Partzuf ZON, and B-ZA-M (AHP of Partzuf ZON) fell below %0a%3c Parsa to the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefirot K-H (GE) that remained in their degree in their Partzuf are called %0a%3c MI, and Sefirot B-ZA-M that separated (in their properties) and descended (by %0a%3c equivalence in properties) to a lower Partzuf are called ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 106 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE CREATOR %0a%3c %0a%3c THE WORLD OFATZILUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA (the 1st Restriction is in force above AA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of AA fell to GE of AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of AVI fell toGEof ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of ZON fell to GE of BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of BYA fell to the point of our world - in the sensation %0a%3c of a person who has attained the level of "our world" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT AS THE LETTERS ELEH DESCEND FROM ABOVE-when Malchut %0a%3c is expelled from Bina, the letters ELEH get detached from AVI and fall to ZON %0a%3c (a lower degree), and clothe themselves in ZON: ELEH of Aba (YESHS - Israel %0a%3c Saba) clothe ZA, and ELEH of Ima {Tvuna) clothe Malchut. Bina of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut is a complex Partzuf: her GE constitute AVI (two Partzufim), and her AHP %0a%3c have the name of a separate Partzuf YESHS UT, for they fulfill separate functions %0a%3c with regard to ZON: Bina-. GE = MI = GE of Aba + Ml = GE of Ima. ELEH = AHP %0a%3c of Aba = YESHS (Israel Saba) + T (Tvuna) = ELEH = AHP of Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Ohr Haya descends from Above (as a result of which Malchut descends %0a%3c from Bina's level back to her own place), three Sefirot B-ZA-M thereby return to %0a%3c their degree, and correspondingly, Sefirot KHB (called the "holy of holies") enter %0a%3c the now complete Partzuf consisting of five Sefirot. (Here, the Light is called by %0a%3c the name of the Sefirot it fills.) Previously, there was only Ohr Ruach-Ne/esh in %0a%3c K-H, and now Ohr Neshama-Haya-Yechida was added to KHB, while Ruach-Nefesh %0a%3c descended to ZA-M. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when AHP of Rosh de AA (B-ZA-M of Rosh de AA) that fell to its %0a%3c Guf ascend (return from Guf to Rosh de AA), the Kelim of GE de AVI ascend %0a%3c along with them to Rosh de AA. (These are the Kelim of GE de AVI that were %0a%3c clothed in AHP de AA in their small state, when AHP de AA had fallen to GE %0a%3c de AVI.) Once there, the Kelim of GE de AVI receive the Light called "holy of %0a%3c holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 107 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that when the Upper One descends to the lower one, %0a%3c it becomes like the lower one. And when the lower one ascends to the Upper %0a%3c One it becomes like the Upper One. This is because no space or motion exist in %0a%3c the spiritual, and only a change of properties instantly and automatically moves %0a%3c a Partzuf or its part in spiritual space, closer (higher) to the Creator or farther %0a%3c away (lower) from Him. Therefore, spiritual ascent itself implies a change of %0a%3c properties of the lower one to those of the Upper One, and a descent of the %0a%3c Upper One signifies that its properties became equal to the properties of the %0a%3c degree to which it descended. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, in Katnut, when Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP de Rosh of Partzuf AA separate %0a%3c from its head and fall (move according to their now inferior properties) to its %0a%3c Guf, from Peh to Chazeh, where Partzuf AVI clothes Partzuf AA, they (B-ZA-M = %0a%3c ZON = AHP de Rosh of AA) become like AVI in their properties, without Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and only with the Light of Bina, Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why, in Gadlut, when B-ZA-M = AHP de AA return to the Rosh (the %0a%3c degree that is higher than Guf), they take with them GE of AVI, as they all became %0a%3c one degree while in Katnut. Therefore, in Gadlut, GE of AVI ascend from AHP %0a%3c de Rosh of AA to Rosh de AA and become equal to it (in their properties), where %0a%3c they receive the Light called "holy of holies" that shines in Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON ascend to AVI in the same way: after AVI receive the Light in Rosh %0a%3c de AA, they acquire strength (screen), and lower Malchut from Bina back to %0a%3c her place in Malchut, thereby enabling their Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP to return to %0a%3c their degree, AVI, as in AA. However, when the Kelim-Sefirot B-ZA-M = AHP %0a%3c de Bina that were inside K-H = GE de ZON ascend to AVI, they also take with %0a%3c them Sefirot of ZON, which they've clothed-K-H = GE de ZON. Thus, K-H = %0a%3c GE de ZON ascend to AVI and there receive the Light called "holy of holies," %0a%3c the Light of Hay a. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that Ima-MOTHER DESCENDS TO HER %0a%3c DAUGHTER TO DRESS AND ADORN HER: the letters ELEH or Ima %0a%3c (Bina) in her small state descend to Malchut. This means that THE MOTHER %0a%3c DESCENDS TO HER DAUGHTER, for the three Sefirot of Ima assumed the %0a%3c property of Malchut, thereby separating from Bina and becoming a part of %0a%3c Malchut. This is akin to Bina giving part of her Kelim to Malchut. Yet, this gift is %0a%3c temporary, as though Bina LENDS, GIVES (these Kelim) FOR TEMPORARY %0a%3c USE, and thus, Malchut uses them temporarily. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then, Ima-Bina (mother) ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a%3c ADORNMENTS. This is so because in Gadlut, when the three Sefirot ELEH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 108 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c return to Bina, Malchut ascends to the degree of Bina together with them, %0a%3c and there receives the Light of "holy of holies." And since an ascent to Bina %0a%3c implies becoming like Bina (in properties), she now has the right to receive the %0a%3c same Light as Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that, as a result of the mother lowering her Kelim (properties) %0a%3c ELEH to her daughter by intentionally assuming the properties (desires) of %0a%3c Malchut instead of her own properties (desires), thereby entering the small state %0a%3c and willingly diminishing herself, upon receiving the properties of Malchut %0a%3c instead of properties of Bina, mother Bina adorned her daughter Malchut with %0a%3c her adornments, meaning the Light that subsequently comes in the state of %0a%3c Gadlut: the Light of Bina entered Malchut. This is described as "Malchut received %0a%3c her adornments." %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of adornments that the daughter Malchut receives %0a%3c from her mother Bina: the first is Ohr Hochma (Ohr Haya, the Light of GAR), %0a%3c the Light of perfection, for it imparts the property of perfection to the Kli %0a%3c that it is filling, the Light that Malchut receives from Ima (Supernal Mother), %0a%3c who stands between Peh and Chazeh of Partzuf AA, above its Parsa. The second %0a%3c adornment is Ohr Neshama, which still designates imperfection, as it is received %0a%3c from the lower mother, Partzuf of Tvuna that stands between Chazeh and Tabur %0a%3c de AA, below its Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c Naturally, to receive either Light, Malchut must ascend to the corresponding %0a%3c degree. In other words, she must change her properties so as to be able to receive, %0a%3c to merit that Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Malchut ascends to Tvuna and receives her adornments from Tvuna, %0a%3c these adornments are still imperfect, for Malchut remains with a "question" %0a%3c (without the Light of Hochma), as Tvuna was before the raising of MAN. This %0a%3c means that to attain perfection, Malchut still needs to receive MAN from the %0a%3c lower ones, called the "husbands of Israel." In this state, the lower ones, called %0a%3c the righteous or "the husbands of Israel," receive the Light from ZA, which %0a%3c ascended to YESHS = hrael-Saha. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Malchut ascends another degree, to the place of the Supernal %0a%3c Mother, Bina, above Chazeh de AA, and there receives her adornments from Ima %0a%3c and not from Tvuna, then these adornments are perfect, for they contain Ohr %0a%3c Haya; there is no more "question" in her, as she is considered a male, bestowing %0a%3c Kli, and the husbands of Israel receive from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the husbands of Israel appear before her and receive the Light from %0a%3c her. And Malchut is CALLED MASTER (Hebrew - Adon). The regular Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 109 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is called by the Creator's female name Adonay (mistress) or ADM, whereas in %0a%3c this state she is called by the male name Adon (master). %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is because Malchut no longer has a question, for MAN is no longer %0a%3c raised within her, as she has reached perfection (Light of Haya) and is therefore %0a%3c called "husband" or master (Adon). Hence, the prophet said: BEHOLD THE %0a%3c ARK OF THE COVENANT, THE MASTER (Adon) OF ALL THE EARTH %0a%3c (Yehoshua, 3:11). Malchut is called the "Ark," for ZA, who bestows upon her, %0a%3c is called the "Covenant." The Zohar calls Malchut the "Master of all the earth" %0a%3c or "husband." %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the letter Hey in the word MA (Mem-Hey), signifying the female %0a%3c essence, leaving Malchut, for the letter Hey signifies the presence of a question in %0a%3c Malchut, i.e., the absence of Ohr Hochma, whereas Ohr Hochma brings absolute %0a%3c knowledge, all questions disappear, and with them the letter Hey. The letter Yod %0a%3c ascends to the place of Hey, and Malchut assumes the name MI as Ima, which %0a%3c signifies Malchut's reception of the name Elokim, as the name Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18. Israel receives the last letters (ELEH) from Above, from Bina down to %0a%3c that place, i.e., to Malchut, who is now called MI, just like the name Bina. I %0a%3c pronounce the letters ELEH and my whole soul weeps so as to receive these %0a%3c letters ELEH from Bina into the house of Elokim, which is Malchut. So that %0a%3c Malchut would be called Elokim, just as Bina is called Elokim. How can I %0a%3c receive them? "With joyous songs of praise sung in the voice of the Torah, and %0a%3c festive throngs" (Tehilim, 42:4). Rabbi Elazar said, "My silence has erected the %0a%3c Temple Above, which is Bina, and the Temple below, which is Malchut. Of %0a%3c course, as people say, 'A word is worth a gold coin (Hebrew - Sela), but silence %0a%3c is worth two.' So the words 'a word is worth a gold coin' mean that I spoke %0a%3c and came to regret it. Silence, my silence, is worth twice as much, for the two %0a%3c worlds, Bina and Malchut, were created by this silence. For had I not kept %0a%3c silent (see item 11), I would not have attained the unity of both worlds." %0a%3c %0a%3c After Hey has left MA and Yod ascended in her place, thereby forming MI, %0a%3c Israel elevates the LAST LETTERS ELEH to Malchut by raising MAN. As we've %0a%3c already explained, in Katnut, ELEH of the Upper One fell to GE of the lower %0a%3c one. Hence, they refer to the lower one in Gadlut as well. For when B-ZA-M = %0a%3c ELEH of the Upper One return to its Rosh, they thereby elevate GE of the lower %0a%3c one, too. The lower one thus acquires the ELEH of the Upper One and the %0a%3c Light with which they filled themselves in their present Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c To equalize with the lower one and enter the state of Katnut, the Upper %0a%3c One deliberately makes Tzimtzum Bet on its AHP. And upon connecting to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 110 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower one, the Upper One returns to the state of Gadlut, and passes the Light to %0a%3c that part of the lower one which they've both occupied in the state of Katnut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This scenario is similar to one when a good, strong person joins a company %0a%3c of wicked men, and connects with them by pretending to be like them. And %0a%3c when such contact is established between them, he begins to correct them, %0a%3c little by little, precisely through this connection that has formed between %0a%3c them beforehand. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Partzuf in the small state is divided into two parts: GE and AHP. %0a%3c However, since there is a "column" of Partzufim between our world and the %0a%3c Creator, there is a connection between them via the common parts of the upper %0a%3c and the lower ones. Precisely because there is a part of an Upper One in each %0a%3c lower one, the lower one can receive strength from Above, through this common %0a%3c property, and ascend independently up to the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Upper One that falls to the lower one completes its Kelim to ten Sefirot: %0a%3c AHP fall to GE of the lower one, and together they make up ten Sefirot, since %0a%3c they stand at the same level. In turn, AHP of the lower one falls into GE of the %0a%3c next lower one, and so on. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards, in Gadlut, when GE of the Upper One receive the strength to %0a%3c attach their AHP to themselves and elevate them, GE of the lower one ascend %0a%3c together with AHP, as they were joined below. Therefore, upon ascending, GE of %0a%3c the lower one continue to be joined with AHP of the Upper One, and together %0a%3c they form a Partzuf of ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c I PRONOUNCE THE LETTERS ELEH: Israel (one who wishes to receive %0a%3c the properties of the Creator) raises MAN (prayer for it) to receive in Malchut %0a%3c the Light of Gadlut (for self-correction) with the help of the letters ELEH, Ima- %0a%3c Bina. This is achieved by praying near the Gates of Tears, after which no one %0a%3c ever returns empty-handed, that is, after raising MAN, ELEH descend from AVI %0a%3c to Malchut, the house of Elokim. This is because after receiving ELEH, Malchut %0a%3c herself receives the name Elokim, just like Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c A WORD IS WORTH A GOLD COIN, BUT SILENCE IS WORTH %0a%3c TWO: the words (spiritual action) of Rabbi Elazar (the spiritual Partzuf of that %0a%3c name) elevated Malchut to Tvuna, below Chazeh de AA, where there is still no %0a%3c Light of Hochma, which designates the presence of a question in Malchut, a %0a%3c request for Ohr Hochma. And this is called "gold" (Hebrew - Sela, a gold coin), %0a%3c for that is the name of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Rabbi Elazar's silence enabled Rabbi Shimon to reveal Ohr %0a%3c Haya by raising Malchut to the Supernal Mother, whereupon both worlds were %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 111 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c simultaneously created, for the lower world, Malchut, was created together with %0a%3c the Upper World, Bina, of which The Zohar speaks: SILENCE IS WORTH %0a%3c TWICE (two worlds) AS MUCH. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19. Rabbi Shimon said, "From here on the perfection of the written is said to %0a%3c bring forth their host by number." For these are two degrees, and each must %0a%3c be recorded, that is, noted: one is called MA and the other MI. MI is the %0a%3c Upper One, and MA is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, %0a%3c and brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hey alludes to the %0a%3c one that is known and unequaled, namely MI. This is similar to the phrase, %0a%3c "HaMotzi Lechem"— He who brings forth bread from the earth (an appeal to %0a%3c the Creator), where the letter Hey refers to the knowledge of the known, lower %0a%3c degree, namely MA. And together they are one degree, Malchut. However, the %0a%3c Upper One is MI de Malchut and the lower one is MA de Malchut, the one %0a%3c that brings forth their host by number, for the number 600,000 refers to the %0a%3c number of stars that stand together, and they bring forth innumerable hosts. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar alludes to the words of the prophet (Yeshayahu, 40:26): "Raise %0a%3c your eyes to the height of Heavens and see: WHO HAS CREATED THESE %0a%3c (them) - MI BARAH ELEH? He that brings out their host by number, He calls %0a%3c them all by name; no one shall be hidden from the greatness of His might and %0a%3c the force of His power." %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "recording" means "marked by the letter Hey," for two degrees %0a%3c must be recorded in Malchut: MI and MA. With the help of the Light that is %0a%3c received at the time of ascent above Chazeh de AA to the Upper World, Malchut %0a%3c becomes like the upper world and assumes the name MI, for the letter Hey exits %0a%3c MA (Mem-Hey), and the letter Yod ascends to its place. Thus, Malchut is called %0a%3c MI, like the Upper World, and is adorned with the male property. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, MA, the previous degree of Malchut, does not disappear. The %0a%3c reason for this is that the degree of MI is essential in order to pass the Light, the %0a%3c perfection of the "holy of holies" to the generations, the posterity of Malchut, %0a%3c NRN of the righteous, the lower ones. However, the birth and procreation of %0a%3c these generations (sons) depend on the name MA. Hence, if either (MA or MI) %0a%3c is missing in Malchut, she will not be able to beget future generations, to create %0a%3c new souls (lower Partzufim filled with Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut BRINGS OUT THEIR HOST BY NUMBER-this %0a%3c is the degree of MI, which Malchut inherits from the Supernal Mother, for %0a%3c the letter Hey before the words "brings out" (Motzi = HaMotzi) alludes to the %0a%3c fact that Malchut contains the perfect Light, called "adornments," which she %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 112 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c receives from AVI. This is the maximal Light that may fill Malchut during the %0a%3c 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same letter, Hey, designates the presence of the Light of YESHSUT, the %0a%3c degree of MA within Malchut. For this degree must also be recorded, be present %0a%3c in Malchut. And these two degrees, MI and MA, are present in Malchut: Ml %0a%3c above and MA below. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls Malchut the "world being revealed." That is to say, whatever %0a%3c Malchut reveals, the lower ones receive. Those individual attainments, individual %0a%3c sensations of the Light that descend from Malchut are what they call "their %0a%3c world." Similarly, whatever we feel in our sensory organs is what we call "our %0a%3c world." But this is nothing more than what we receive from Malchut of the %0a%3c lowest degree in the world of Assiya, Malchut of the previous degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, we should know that the actual notion of "our world" indicates %0a%3c the true attainment of the degree called "our world," i.e., man's sensation of his %0a%3c ultimate disconnection from the Creator, total helplessness, and the realization %0a%3c of his absolute egoism. One can attain this sensation only if the spiritual Light %0a%3c shines on him from Above, in contrast to which he will see his true spiritual %0a%3c state. However, in order to reach such a state, one must make great efforts in the %0a%3c study of Kabbalah so as to draw upon himself the influence of the Surrounding %0a%3c Light ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when man attains this state, he immediately raises such a request %0a%3c to the Creator that his MAN is not left unanswered, and he receives the strength %0a%3c to transcend "our world" and ascend with his properties to a Higher Degree— %0a%3c Malchut of the world of Assiya. And then it is she that becomes his world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we are speaking about very high degrees. The Malchut that is being %0a%3c revealed is Malchut of the world of Atzilut, Nukva de ZA. And the fact that The %0a%3c Zohar calls her "Supernal" indicates the state of Malchut when she attains the %0a%3c degree of MI during her ascent and clothing the Upper World, the Supernal %0a%3c Mother. Therefore, Malchut herself is then called "Supernal," and the degree of %0a%3c MA is, accordingly, called "lower." %0a%3c %0a%3c KNOWS ALL THE HOSTS BY NUMBER: number designates perfection. %0a%3c Light without a number indicates that the Light is imperfect, whereas the Light %0a%3c with a number is perfect. The action of ZA with regard to passing the Light from %0a%3c Bina to Malchut is described in the phrase: THE HEAVENS TELL OF THE %0a%3c CREATOR'S GREATNESS. THE HEAVENS (ZA) TELL (Hebrew-Mesaf>er, %0a%3c from the word Mispar— number, the Light's perfection). ZA passes this Light %0a%3c from AVI to Malchut, called THE CREATOR'S GREATNESS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 113 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light is called 600,000, for the degree of Malchut designates units, %0a%3c the degree of ZA— tens, the degree of YESHSLT— hundreds, the degree of AVI— %0a%3c thousands, the degree of AA— tens of thousands. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two parts in AVI: their own part, where they are regarded as %0a%3c thousands, and the part from Ohr Hochma that is received from Rosh de AA, where %0a%3c they are regarded as AA, that is, tens of thousands. However, they cannot be %0a%3c considered a complete degree of AA, but only as its VAK, for they clothe AA from %0a%3c the Peh down to the Chazeh. And since VAK = Vav Ketzavot = 6 Sefirot x 10 = 60, %0a%3c the degree of VAK de AA equals 60 x 10,000 = 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when Malchut ascends to AVI, she receives a complete, perfect %0a%3c number— 600,000, where 60 signifies that it is merely VAK, for Malchut has %0a%3c not yet reached Rosh de AA and that she still lacks this degree. And the degree %0a%3c of 10,000 refers to AA, the part that clothes in AVI, for AVI are VAK de AA. %0a%3c Therefore, Malchut contains the number 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, two degrees are recorded in Malchut: %0a%3c %0a%3c - MI, the degree of AVI that clothes in Malchut, through which Malchut %0a%3c receives the degree of the Upper World and is called accordingly, %0a%3c while the Light in it is called 600,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c - MA, the degree of YESHSL/T that clothes in Malchut, through which %0a%3c Malchut has a question, the sensation of lack of Ohr Hochma, and the %0a%3c request for its reception. Malchut is therefore called the "lower world." %0a%3c %0a%3c These two degrees create one Partzuf within Malchut: her part that is above %0a%3c the Chazeh is clothed in AVI, and her part that is below the Chazeh is clothed in %0a%3c YESHSL/T. Therefore, in the generations, in Malchut's descendants, each Partzuf %0a%3c consists of two parts (degrees): from the Upper Part (MI) there is a Light of %0a%3c 600,000, and from the lower part (lower world, MA), there is an absence of %0a%3c number (perfection) in each descendant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase, THEY BRING FORTH INNUMERABLE HOSTS is not %0a%3c interpreted as infinitely big. Rather, "Innumerable" indicates the imperfection %0a%3c of the Light that is received in the lower part, as it comes from YESHSL/T, the %0a%3c degree that is without a number. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut's descendants are therefore defined as imperfect, as these two %0a%3c degrees exist in her as one, and are connected as one. Hence, there are two %0a%3c degrees in Malchut's descendants: the Upper One— 600,000, and the lower %0a%3c one— without a number. However, the lower one is defined as supplement to %0a%3c perfection and is not considered a flaw. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 114 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that the blessing of the seed, propagation depends %0a%3c only on the lower world, MA, without a number, as it is said in the Torah that %0a%3c Avraham complained that he is childless (Beresheet, 15:5), and the answer was: %0a%3c "Look now toward Heaven, and count the stars. Will you be able to count them? %0a%3c So shall be your descendants." From this we see that the blessing of the seed %0a%3c comes from the lack of a number, i.e., the name MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, after all the perfection that Malchut attains from the Light of AVI %0a%3c (Ml), Malchut has an additional blessing from MA, which is called the "lack of %0a%3c a number," and both these degrees are included in her descendants— the souls %0a%3c and generations. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20. All of these 600,000 and all their innumerable hosts, He calls the names. %0a%3c What does this mean: "calls the names?" If you say that He calls them by their %0a%3c names, it is not so, for then it would have said, "calls by name." However, %0a%3c when this degree does not ascend in the name Elokim, but is called MI, %0a%3c it does not beget and does not reveal those that are concealed within it. %0a%3c And although they were all concealed within it, meaning that even though %0a%3c the letters ELEH have already ascended, the "precious garment" of Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim is still concealed. And while it is concealed, it is not called by the %0a%3c name Elokim. For He created the letters ELEH and they ascended in His %0a%3c Name— clothed themselves in "precious garments" of Ohr Hassadim, as a %0a%3c result of which ELEH combine with MI, and are called Elo'im. Then, by %0a%3c the power of this name, He brought them forth in perfection, defined as %0a%3c CALLS THEIR NAMES, which means that He called by name and brought %0a%3c forth every type and species to exist in perfection. Hence, it is said: HE %0a%3c BROUGHT FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER— called them all by %0a%3c name, that is, by the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned that the perfection of the Light, which is the %0a%3c Creator's name Elo-im, descends to the souls, generations, descendants, two %0a%3c degrees joined in one. This degree includes 600,000 from the Upper Degree, %0a%3c and innumerable hosts from the lower, and the Creator's name descends on %0a%3c both of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The blessing of the seed depends entirely on MA, for it is determined by %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, as this Light designates perfection. Whereas the Light without %0a%3c a number, Ohr Hassadim, comes precisely from the name MA. As is already %0a%3c known, Ohr Hochma is accepted only when clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Until such %0a%3c clothing occurs, even though ELEH ascend to MI, the name Elokim (ELO-IM = %0a%3c ELEH + IM) does not act. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mother Lends Her Clothes to Her Daughter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 115 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that MI DOES NOT BEGET (ANY OFFSPRING), %0a%3c even though the point of Malchut left the thought (Bina) and descended back %0a%3c to her place, and all ten Sefirot and the Light returned to the Partzuf, THE %0a%3c NAME ELEH IS still CONCEALED, for she still cannot receive Hochma in the %0a%3c absence of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, BECAUSE HE CREATED ELEH, meaning that after He added a %0a%3c Zivug to the screen of MA (lower world, Malchut), there appeared Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c called WITHOUT A NUMBER. And ELEH were filled with Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c which means BARAH = CREATED ELEH, as clothing in Ohr Hassadim is called %0a%3c BARAH (creation). Only after this are they called ELOKIM, for only after the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hassadim can they receive Ohr Hochma, called "the Light of a %0a%3c number," the Light of 600,000, as a result of which, the letters combine and %0a%3c form the complete name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same perfection (clothing of Hochma in Hassadim) also extends to %0a%3c the souls and descendants that emerge from the name Elokim. AND HE IS %0a%3c CALLED BY THIS NAME: all that emerges is called by this name, with these %0a%3c properties He creates all descendants— Partzufim from His Zivug on Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c THE NAME 600,000 is Hochma, TOGETHER WITH HASSADIM, so that they %0a%3c will have the perfection of the name, so that Light will clothe Light, as they are %0a%3c clothed in the NAME. It is therefore written: SEE, I CALL THEM BY NAME, %0a%3c for "to call" means to revive and bring to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21. He asks, "What is the meaning of 'by the greatness of His might and %0a%3c wealth?'" This is the head of the degree, where all desires ascend and remain %0a%3c concealed. The strong one that ascended in the name Elokim, as it is said, %0a%3c "This is the secret of the Upper World, called MI." No man is missing from %0a%3c the 600,000 that He created by the power of this name. And because no one %0a%3c is missing from these 600,000, it follows that wherever the sons of Israel %0a%3c perished and were punished for their transgressions, we subsequently find %0a%3c that not one from the 600,000 had disappeared, so that everything would %0a%3c remain the same Above and below. And just as no one had disappeared from %0a%3c the 600,000 Above, no one has disappeared from this number below. %0a%3c %0a%3c FROM THE GREATNESS OF HIS MIGHT AND WEALTH signifies %0a%3c Keter de AVI, called the HEAD OF DEGREES. This is Bina of AA, which %0a%3c became Keter de Partzuf AVI, WHERE ALL DESIRES ASCEND (MAN of the %0a%3c lower ones), and receive all the degrees from there. This degree is filled with %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, and exists in perfection even in the absence of Ohr Hochma, as its %0a%3c Light of Hassadim comes from GAR de BINA of AA. In other words, it has such %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 116 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a powerful Light of Hassadim that although this degree emerged from Rosh de %0a%3c AA, it is not regarded as having left it, for it feels no need for Ohr Hochma. This %0a%3c degree, Keter of AVI, is the Rosh of all the degrees in the world of Atzilut, from %0a%3c where AVI, YESHSUT and ZON receive the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STRONG ONE IS THE SECRET OF THE UPPER WORLD, the %0a%3c property of MI that is present in Malchut, from where the number 600,000 %0a%3c descends, for she clothes the Upper World, AVI. Therefore, it is written that %0a%3c NO ONE DISAPPEARS FROM THOSE 600,000 because there Malchut %0a%3c receives Ohr Hochma, called "600,000 " Hence, it is said that AS NO ONE %0a%3c DISAPPEARED ABOVE, SO IT IS BELOW, for Malchut clothes AVI, described %0a%3c in the phrase: THE MOTHER ADORNS HER DAUGHTER WITH HER %0a%3c OWN ADORNMENTS, by which Malchut becomes completely similar to AVI. %0a%3c And just as the Light of AVI is perfect (which is why it is called "600,000" and %0a%3c NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED, i.e., no lack of Ohr Hochma is felt), Malchut is %0a%3c perfect in this number, which means NO ONE HAS DISAPPEARED below. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 22. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba said: "In the first four words of the Torah, IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED Et - Beresheet Barah Elokim %0a%3c Et, the first two words begin with the letter Bet, and the following two begin %0a%3c with Aleph" (The letter Aleph is pronounced both as "A" and "E"). It is said %0a%3c that when the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still %0a%3c concealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator %0a%3c gazed into the letters and played with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the language of Kabbalah, the same sentence appears in the following %0a%3c way: when the Creator (Bina) decided to create the world (ZON of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut), the Kelim of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva) were still in Bina. Hochma %0a%3c and Bina (Aba ve Ima - AVI) are called 2,000 years. Before the creation of the %0a%3c world (the birth of ZON), all the letters (the Kelim of ZON) existed in AVI in %0a%3c the form of MAN, and MAN always stimulates a desire in the Upper One to %0a%3c attend to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to the lower Partzuf, the Upper One is called the Creator, %0a%3c for it truly begets it, and whatever the lower one receives, comes directly from %0a%3c its Upper One. Moreover, one may say that this is all that the Upper One %0a%3c desires, its entire existence is meant exclusively for the lower one. Therefore, %0a%3c the Upper One always waits for the lower one's genuine request for the desire %0a%3c to ascend spiritually, which is called MAN. Provided this desire is sincere, the %0a%3c Upper One immediately responds and passes the powerful Light of correction %0a%3c to the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the lower one is ZON of the world of Atzilut, and all that is below %0a%3c this Partzuf (all the worlds of ABYA and our world) is considered a part %0a%3c of it, AVI of the world of Atzilut constitute the Upper Partzuf. The desires %0a%3c and properties of ZON are called "letters," and here The Zohar explains the %0a%3c properties that ZON (the spiritual worlds and our world, we ourselves) were %0a%3c %0a%3c 117 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 118 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c created with, which properties are desirable, which require correction, and %0a%3c how this correction is achieved. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the properties of the future Creature are determined by the %0a%3c Creator's purpose in creating it, it is said that even before the creation of %0a%3c the world, the Creator played with the letters. The word "played" suggests %0a%3c that the Creator's interaction with the Creature is like His game with the %0a%3c leviathan (the legendary sea monster), with the property that is opposite %0a%3c from Him. At the end of correction all the letters unite and combine into %0a%3c the one name of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of the Hebrew alphabet indicates the descent of the Direct %0a%3c Light from Above, the Inner Light that fills the Partzuf. The reverse order of %0a%3c the letters from the end of the alphabet alludes to the ascent of the Returning %0a%3c Light. The direct order of the alphabet refers to mercy, whereas the reverse %0a%3c order— to the strict law and restrictions on using egoistic desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Adam sinned, the letters detached themselves from him, and only %0a%3c the letters Shin and Tav (the Kelim for the Light of VAK of Nefesh) remained in %0a%3c him. The Kelim for the Light of Neshama are represented by the letters from %0a%3c Aleph to Yod; the letters from Yod to Ku/ are the Kelim for the Light of Ruach, and %0a%3c the letters Kuf and Reish— the Kelim for GAR of Nefesh— disappeared from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Adam gave his son, born after his sin, the name SHeT(Seth): Shin- %0a%3c Tav, according to the two last letters of the alphabet— the Kelim that remained %0a%3c in him. The Kli Shin-Tav are only fit for the Returning Light from below %0a%3c upwards, but not for the reception of the Upper Light from Above downwards. %0a%3c However, after it receives Yesod of Zeir Anpin (the letter Yod), Shin-Tav turns into a %0a%3c combination Shin- Yod- Tav. And if the Creator creates the world by the letter Bet, %0a%3c it then enters between Shin and Tav and forms the word Shahhat (Sh-B-T), the %0a%3c state of spiritual perfection, the goal of creation. For this reason, the first word %0a%3c in the Torah— Beresheet consists of: Bara (created) Sh(in)-Y(od)-T(av). %0a%3c %0a%3c 23. When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet %0a%3c came to Him in reverse order from last (Tav) to first (Aleph). The letter Tav %0a%3c entered first and said, "Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, %0a%3c to create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your %0a%3c ring, called EmeT (truth), that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You %0a%3c are called truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with %0a%3c the letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit %0a%3c the world that I conceived to be created by your properties, since you are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 119 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c destined to be marked on the foreheads of the truly faithful who fulfill all %0a%3c of Torah from Aleph to Tav (from the first letter to the last), and perished %0a%3c because of you" (Talmud Bavli, Shabbat, 55) %0a%3c %0a%3c What does a particular name of the Creator mean? The name of the spiritual %0a%3c object indicates the way one can receive the Light that fills it, the way one can %0a%3c attain its spiritual degree. Generally speaking, the twenty-two letters are the ten %0a%3c Sefirot-Kelim in the Ibur (embryonic phase) of the future Partzuf in the Sefira %0a%3c Yesod, for that is where the screen of the embryo of the new Partzuf is located. %0a%3c That is why Yesod is called a "number," as it measures the size of a new Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bearing in mind that each name determines specific spiritual properties %0a%3c and states of an object, one can understand what is meant by a change of name, %0a%3c place, or action. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH is the basis of all the letters, but the filling of each letter clarifies the %0a%3c letter itself. The filling of a letter is heard as the letter is pronounced. As we read %0a%3c the letter Yod in the word HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey), we actually pronounce %0a%3c three sounds (y-o-d); although we write only one letter, the sounds "o-Vav" and %0a%3c "d-Dalet" are heard together with the sound "y." When we say "Hey," the sound %0a%3c "ey"— Yod or "ey"— follows the sound "h." Therein lies the clarification of the %0a%3c name HaVaYaH in the process of its emergence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's form-properties are revealed in His deeds; hence, the three %0a%3c lines in Bina (the Creator) are imprinted and act in His created beings (the lower %0a%3c worlds) as a seal and its imprint. Therefore, the name MB exists in Bina, as well %0a%3c as in ZA and Malchut. However, in ZA, this name is divided into the ten sayings %0a%3c and thirty-two forces of creation of Elokim, which create Malchut, the creature. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina is designated by the letter Mem, Malchut— by Bet; the name MB designates %0a%3c the creation of Malchut by Bina. The letter Aleph designates ZA, which passes all %0a%3c the twenty-two letters (from Ale£>h to Tav) to Malchut (Bet). This is why Malchut %0a%3c is called ET (Aleph pronounced as 'E'-Tav). %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is the central part of creation and its purpose. She is the only %0a%3c creation and includes all the worlds with all that inhabits them, us included. %0a%3c Depending on its states, parts of Malchut or Malchut herself (which is one and %0a%3c the same) have different properties designated by the different letter combina- %0a%3c tions. For this reason, Malchut's parts receive various "codes" (combinations) %0a%3c of letters (properties) or names. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the words in the world originate here, in Malchut. There is not a %0a%3c single property in the world that is not included in Malchut. Each property of %0a%3c Malchut, each of the creatures (for all creatures are her parts) is designated by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 120 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the property that distinguishes it from the others, by the unique set of letters- %0a%3c properties that forms its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called Shechina (Divinity), as she is filled with the Light, Shochen %0a%3c (Dweller— the Creator). The Creator is called Shochen when Malchut feels Him %0a%3c as such, within her. If man, being part of Malchut, purifies himself of egoism, %0a%3c either partially or completely, and thus fills his corrected desires with the Light %0a%3c (the Creator), he becomes part of the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of four parts that are named by their properties (also called %0a%3c faces): face of a lion, face of an ox, face of an eagle, and face of a man. Alternately, %0a%3c Malchut is likened to a spiritual kernel, surrounded by four shells, which corre- %0a%3c spond to the four Klipot (impure forces): Ruach Se'ara (Stormy Wind), Anan Gadol %0a%3c (Great Cloud), Esh Mitlakachat (Blazing Flame), and Noga (Radiance). %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah can describe spiritual actions either as names of Sefirot and %0a%3c Partzufim or as names of HaVaYaH, EKYEH, and so forth, with their fillings %0a%3c and Gematriot (plural for Gematria— the numeric value). Although the most %0a%3c frequently used language is that of Sefirot and Partzufim, sometimes the %0a%3c language of HaVaYaH with its fillings can also be applied, even in parallel or %0a%3c simultaneously with the former. %0a%3c %0a%3c Most Kabbalistic terms are composite: Maatzil (the Creator) comes from the %0a%3c word Tzel (shadow), as the Creature emerges from the Creator's concealment, %0a%3c from His restrictions. Another name for the Creator is Boreh (combination of %0a%3c Bo— come and Re 'eh— see). %0a%3c %0a%3c A name denotes attainment. Upon attaining an object, man gives it a %0a%3c name. Similarly, man gives a name to the Creator according to the property %0a%3c that he attains, depending on how he feels the Creator. There are several %0a%3c kinds of names to the Creator, based on His properties. For example, the %0a%3c Creator's name EMET— "Truth" is based on the sensations of His Light within %0a%3c the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Below are the names of the Creator with the corresponding names of %0a%3c the Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c - Keter: Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey (EKYEH) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hochma: Yod-Hey (YA) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Bina: HaVaYaH with the punctuation Segol-Holam-Hirik, as Elokim: Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c (Yod-Vav-Dalet) - Hey (Hey-Yod) - Vav (Vav-Ahph-Vav) - Hey (Hey-Yod). %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hesed: Aleph-Lamed = EL (pronounced KEL) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Qevura: Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem (ELOKIM) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 121 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Tifferet: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey (HaVaYaH without punctuation) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Netzah: HaVaYaH TZEVAOT %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hod: ELOKJM TZEVAOT %0a%3c %0a%3c - Yesod: Shin-Dalet-Yod = SHADDAY %0a%3c %0a%3c - Malchut: ADONAY (pronounced ADM) %0a%3c %0a%3c Merging the two worlds, the Upper and the lower, is designated by the %0a%3c words HaVaYaH- ADM, implying the ascent of Malchut-ADM to the level of %0a%3c Bina-HaVaYaH with the punctuation of Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name ZA of HaVaYaH comes from the right line (Hesed), and the name %0a%3c ADNI, from the left line (Gevura). Joining of these two lines forms the middle %0a%3c line, where the Light of Hochma shines on account of the presence of the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim from the right line. Such state is designated by a combination of the %0a%3c two names Ha VaYaH-ADM: %0a%3c %0a%3c YOD-Aleph-HEY-Dalet-VAV-Nun-HEY-Yod. The union (Zivug) of ZA and his %0a%3c Nukva is designated by mixing the two names. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVdYaH-ADM: Yod-Aleph-Hey-Dalet-Vav-Nun-Hey-Yod. The opening Yod %0a%3c indicates the Light of Hochma in ZA, the Yod at the end refers to the passing of %0a%3c this Light to Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascended to Bina, and governs %0a%3c Bina and ZA with her desire. Since it is impossible to receive the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in the three Sefirot—Bina, ZA, and Malchut, which are governed by Malchut's %0a%3c egoistic desire, the Light of Hochma is absent in the Partzuf, and only the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim is present. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is designated in the following way: the letter Yod enters the word Light %0a%3c (Ohr contains the letters Aleph- Vav-Reish, signifying the Light of Hochma), and %0a%3c forms the word Avir (air, containing the letters Aleph- Vav-Yod-Reish), signifying %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim. If the Partzuf returns to the Gadlut state, the letter Yod %0a%3c exits it, and it is refilled with the Light of Hochma. Consequently, Avir (air) %0a%3c becomes Ohr (Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Unfilled HaVaYaH designates Partzuf Keter. HaVaYaH with the filling of %0a%3c AB (72) designates Partzuf Hochma (AA). HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG (63) %0a%3c designates Partzuf Bina (AVI). Together, these three HaVaYaH form MB (42) %0a%3c letters— the sacred name of the Light that corrects the souls by its influence on %0a%3c the Kli, the screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that was created is the desire to receive pleasure, which we call "creature." %0a%3c Only this desire was created, and nothing else. All the worlds and all that inhabits %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 122 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c them, our world with everything within it, are but degrees of the desire to %0a%3c receive pleasure. The intensity of the desire determines its place in the spiritual %0a%3c realm, where all creation and our world— as its lowest point— are located. Man's %0a%3c actual location (the world, his spiritual degree) determines the particular kind %0a%3c of pleasure he desires, how he chooses to enjoy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order for the creature to emerge from the Creator, the Light emanating %0a%3c from Him must descend through four stages, whereas the fifth stage already %0a%3c perceives itself as a separate and independent (from the Creator) desire to enjoy %0a%3c precisely the Light emanating from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon emerging from the Creator— a result of a sequential emanation of %0a%3c His Light— the desire to receive pleasure (Kli-vessel) also consists of five parts %0a%3c designated by the letters: the tip of the Yod, Yod, Hey, Vav, Hey. These five parts %0a%3c (four letters) are called the Creator's name HaVaYaH, because the Kli gives the %0a%3c Creator a name according to its sensation of Him, according to its sensation of %0a%3c the Light that fills it. The Light that fills the Kli is called "filling." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kli created by the Creator is divided into five parts, called "worlds." %0a%3c Each world is in turn divided into five more parts, called Partzufim (faces). Then, %0a%3c each Partzuf (singular for Partzufim) consists of five parts called Sefirot. In all, %0a%3c there are 5x5x5= 125 spiritual objects or degrees from the lowest degree to %0a%3c the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Partzuf consists of five parts (Sefirot), designated by a dot and four %0a%3c letters: Keter-dot + Hochma-Yod + Bina-Hey + ZA-Vav + Malchut-Hey = HaVaYaH. %0a%3c The difference between each of the 125 Partzufim lies in the type of Light that fills %0a%3c them, whereas the core of the Kli, the letters HaVaYaH, remain the same. A desire %0a%3c cannot appear unless the Creator's Light had previously passed through the five %0a%3c stages; only the fifth stage is considered a birth of a new creation (desire). %0a%3c %0a%3c The whole universe (all the worlds) is nothing but the ten Sefirot or the %0a%3c Creator's name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTER %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A dot, the tip of the letter Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galgalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AK %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AB %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 123 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A filling of HaVaYaH with Light is referred to as its revelation. Thus, the %0a%3c letters emerge from the state of concealment when they are not filled. In all there %0a%3c are five Partzufim: Keter (Galgalta), AB, SAG, MA and BON. The first— Partzuf %0a%3c Keter— is the main one and the source of all the rest. Its ten Sefirot is plain (inner) %0a%3c HaVaYaH, for each of the four letters of its HaVaYaH comes outside, revealing %0a%3c a new Partzuf that clothes it. %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, out of Partzuf Keter-Galgalta, from the letter Yod comes Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma (AB), from the letter Hey— Partzuf Bina (SAG), from the letter Vav— %0a%3c Partzuf ZA (MA), and from the letter Hey— Partzuf Malchut (BON). Thus Partzuf %0a%3c Keter is designated by plain HaVaYaH, and the Partzufim that clothe it are %0a%3c designated by filled HaVaYaH. The recording of HaVaYaH with the Light %0a%3c that fills it is called Miluy (filling). For the purposes of brevity when naming %0a%3c a Partzuf, the notion of Gematria was introduced. Gematria is the numerical %0a%3c value of the Light that fills the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wisdom (Hochma) is called calculation (Heshbon), Gematria. A calculation %0a%3c is made only in a place where Light is received: (i) a preliminary calculation is %0a%3c made as to how much Light the Partzuf can receive for the Creator's sake; (ii) %0a%3c the Light is received in accordance with the calculation; (iii) calculation of the %0a%3c received amount, called Miluy, Gematria. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma without the Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c and in that event, Hochma cannot shine in her. Then Malchut ascends to Bina %0a%3c and becomes like an embryo inside of her, by which she receives the right %0a%3c line— Hassadim. Upon joining the past and the present states, Malchut receives %0a%3c Hochma into Hassadim, and the Light of Hochma shines in her. All these actions %0a%3c of Malchut are accompanied by calculations, called Gematriot. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Gematria (numerical value) of the Partzuf unfilled with the Light, the %0a%3c Gematria of the empty HaVaYaH is as follows: %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH = Yod + He;y + Vav + Hey = 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26. The Gematria of a %0a%3c filled HaVaYaH is formed by filling each letter; In Hebrew, each letter has a full %0a%3c name: A-Aleph, B-Bet, etc.. Hence, there are four kinds of fillings in HaVaYaH: %0a%3c 1) AB, 2) SAG, 3) MA and 4) BON. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) HaVaYaH with the filling of AB: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Yod + Vav = 6 + 10 + 6 = 22 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 124 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In all: 20 + 15 + 22 + 15 = 72 = AB, where "A" designates the letter Ayin = 70, %0a%3c and not Aleph = 1. HaVaYaH filled with this Light is called Partzuf AB (Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma), for the letter Yod with its filling signifies the Light of Wisdom, Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Such a filling is called "HaVaYaH with the filling of Yod." %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG: the Partzuf that is filled with Light of %0a%3c Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, is called SAG, for its Gematria is this: %0a%3c %0a%3c SAG = Samech (60) + Gimel (3) = 63: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 %0a%3c He?: Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c In all: 20 + 15 + 13 + 15 = 63 = Samech + Gimel = SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Kelim and their filling originate from the first restriction, the letter %0a%3c Yod is present in the filling of HaVaYaH. And if the Kelim are filled with the %0a%3c Light of the second restriction, it is the letter Aleph, present in the filling of %0a%3c HaVaYaH. The difference between the Gematriot of AB and SAG lies in the %0a%3c filling of the letter Vav. Gematria of Vav in Partzuf AB is twenty-two (from the %0a%3c filling of Ohr Hochma), whereas Gematria of Vav in Partzuf SAG is thirteen (from %0a%3c the filling of Ohr Hassadim). From the aforesaid, it is clear that Partzuf AB %0a%3c originates from the first restriction, whereas the letter Vav (ZA) in Partzuf SAG %0a%3c originates from the second restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) HaVaYaH with the filling of MA: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey: Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 6 + 13 + 6 = 45 = Mem (40) + Hey (5) = %0a%3c MA (the letter Hey is pronounced as "ah"). %0a%3c %0a%3c 4) HaVaYaH with the filling of BON: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Vav =12 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 52 = Nun (50) + %0a%3c Bet (2), pronounced as BON for easier articulation. This is the Gematria of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 125 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Malchut, and it is equivalent to twice the value of the unfilled HaVaYaH: %0a%3c HaVaYaH = 26, and 26 x 2 = 52 = MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Malchut cannot receive the Creator's Light due to the absence of a %0a%3c screen. Instead, it can only passively receive what Partzuf ZA gives it. Hence, the %0a%3c twofold twenty-six indicates that whatever Malchut has comes to her from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the four kinds of HaVaYaH, it becomes clear that the root of creation %0a%3c is neither Partzuf Hochma nor Bina, but only ZA, as it is the first Partzuf built on %0a%3c the second restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The primary ten Sefirot are located in Partzuf Keter, whereas Partzufim AB, %0a%3c SAG, MA, and BON are merely branches stemming from the first Partzuf. %0a%3c However, when the Light spreads within the Partzuf, it contains five inner %0a%3c Lights NRNHY and five outer Lights. The five outer Lights of Bina come out %0a%3c of the right ear, and the five inner Lights of Bina come out of the left. The five %0a%3c outer Lights of ZA come out of the right nostril, and the five inner Lights of %0a%3c ZA come out of the left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) are remote from one another, %0a%3c as a branch in our world, man's ear holes are also separated and distanced. The %0a%3c two nostrils are separated by a smaller distance, whereas the five inner and outer %0a%3c Lights of the common Light of the Peh (mouth) come out of the same opening. %0a%3c Thus, as they exit the mouth, they collide and interweave, and as a result of their %0a%3c collisions, letters (Kelim) are born. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since twenty-two letters originate from Bina-SAG = Samech + Gimel = 60 + %0a%3c 3 = 63, the opening through which they come out is called 63 + 22 = 85 = Peh + %0a%3c Hey = PeH (mouth). The letters come out of the Peh of ZA, for Yesod of Ima is %0a%3c located there. %0a%3c %0a%3c We received our entire Torah, all of the knowledge about the spiritual %0a%3c worlds, from our Great Patriarchs, who ascended spiritually above our world, %0a%3c sensed the Upper Worlds, and described them to us. This is how we received the %0a%3c whole Torah— both the written and the oral parts. %0a%3c %0a%3c We cannot imagine the spiritual world because our sensory organs cannot %0a%3c detect it. Thus, to describe the objects and concepts still unattainable by us, %0a%3c Kabbalists use several techniques, languages. The whole Torah speaks only %0a%3c of the creation, governing, and correction of the world; never about history, %0a%3c geography, or anything else. As it is said in the Torah itself, the Torah is the %0a%3c sacred names, that is, manifestations of the Creator, the degrees and methods %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 126 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c jbalists, those who ascend to the spiritual world and thus establisl %0a%3c r, convey this information to us using four langua %0a%3c %0a%3c age of the TaNaKh (Torah— Pentateuch, Nevi'im— Pre %0a%3c ets, Ketuvim— Writings/Hagiographa). This is the language of tl %0a%3c written Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The language of laws. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The language of legends, %0a%3c language of Sefirot and Partzufim— the language of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c languages speak about the same thing— the attainment of the ( %0a%3c by us, those living in this world. For this is the sole purpose of our creation, and %0a%3c according to the Creator's design, we must devote all of our physical, mental, %0a%3c and spiritual abilities only to it. And if we were to aspire only to this, we would %0a%3c naturally use our language only for this purpose. After all, everything that is %0a%3c an to us is only for the fulfillment of this exclusive goal— the attainment i %0a%3c )r, while still in this life. %0a%3c %0a%3c why the first language mastered by humankind was %0a%3c However, as they distanced from fulfilling their mission, humankind cor %0a%3c other languages. All the other languages in the world have their inner meaning, %0a%3c too, but since their alphabets were not revealed to us by Kabbalists, we study the %0a%3c spiritual forces depicted in the Hebrew alphabet, the source of all the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every Partzuf is divided into two parts: right and left. The right part consists of %0a%3c Ramach = Reish - Mem - Chet = 248 parts (organs) filled with the Light of Hassadim; %0a%3c and the left part consists of Shasah = Shin - Samech - Hey = 365 parts (tendons) %0a%3c filled with the Light of Hochma. ZA is called a "voice"; he is generally the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim. But when he joins with Malchut, called "speech," Malchut receives the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim with Hochma from ZA, and thus "speech" is formed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a%3c names of ZA originate from the 70 (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is called %0a%3c "Heaven" and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also called Ruach, %0a%3c owing to the Light of Ruach within them, which ascends to Bina (ears) and %0a%3c transforms into sound: Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a difference between language and alphabet, as in our world there %0a%3c are people who can speak, but cannot read or write. The most ancient spoken %0a%3c language is that of the TaNaKh, which dates back to Adam. The language of laws %0a%3c originated from it, followed by the language of legends. All of these languages %0a%3c combined and each of them in particular are used in our holy scriptures. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language of Kabbalah was the last to develop. It is the most difficult %0a%3c language, since proper understanding of it requires sensing the spiritual categories %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 127 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that this language narrates. Kabbalah is also the most precise language of all. It is %0a%3c the only language that can accurately render all the spiritual information. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c learn it and grasp its information. And since for many generations there %0a%3c were only a few Kabbalists, unconnected with one another, the language of %0a%3c Kabbalah was the last to evolve. Even today it can only be "learned" directly %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially, Kabbalists enciphered their knowledge of the spiritual world as %0a%3c letters, whose outlines reflected the interrelationships of spiritual forces. In %0a%3c other words, each spiritual degree is characterized by a unique interrelationship %0a%3c of spiritual forces. By assigning each spiritual property with a particular symbol, %0a%3c one can depict the interrelationship, as well as the general product of the union %0a%3c of spiritual forces of each degree, i.e., its essence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Kabbalists created the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The %0a%3c Zohar pays much attention to analyzing the connection between the letters, which %0a%3c helps a student to synthesize his knowledge and find new ways of discovering %0a%3c spiritual forces and their actions within. %0a%3c %0a%3c As our forefather Avraham writes in his Book of Creation (Sefer Yetzira), letters %0a%3c represent the stones from which the building-word is constructed. As our sages %0a%3c tell us, the world was created with the letters of the "sacred language," each letter %0a%3c representing a certain holy, spiritual, altruistic force of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The properties of this force are reflected in the letter's outline, its %0a%3c importance with regard to other letters, its potential combinations with the %0a%3c others, its potential punctuation marks, its crowns and notations, its numerical %0a%3c value (Gematria) and variations. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this only concerns separate letters and their combinations. There %0a%3c are also certain rules that enable us to determine the properties of spiritual %0a%3c forces not from letters, but from whole words. Moreover, quite often we can %0a%3c replace letters or even parts of a word with similar ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language itself, the roots of its words, indicate the properties of the %0a%3c spiritual object they describe. For example, Adam originated from Adama— earth, %0a%3c which emphasizes his insignificance, and from the word Adameh— similar (to the %0a%3c Upper One), which emphasizes his eminence. The name Yaakov comes from the %0a%3c word Ekev— to get around (Esau). There are many such examples in the Torah, for %0a%3c everything is named after its root, as after the patronymic name of one's father. %0a%3c %0a%3c Once we have established that certain combinations of letters (Kelim, %0a%3c language of letters) can be used instead of the language of Sefirot and Partzufim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c through %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from a Kabbalist-teacher. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 128 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when describing spiritual actions, the entire description of the spiritual worlds %0a%3c amounts to portraying objects and actions in the form of letters and their %0a%3c combinations. This is how the whole of the Torah is written, in words. Thus, %0a%3c %0a%3c a) The shape of each letter and the elements of its structure indicate %0a%3c all the properties and the general state of a spiritual object, Sefira, or %0a%3c Partzuf, which this particular letter depicts; %0a%3c %0a%3c b) The order of letters in a word indicates the connection between %0a%3c spiritual objects, Sefirot, and their shared properties and actions. %0a%3c Attainment of a word's spiritual meaning signifies an ascent to the %0a%3c spiritual level of the object. When that happens, he who attains %0a%3c it becomes this very word, assumes its name. Man's name keeps %0a%3c changing as he ascends the spiritual degrees; it is determined by %0a%3c the degree he is on, as he assumes the name of that degree. It is %0a%3c therefore said that everyone can become like Moshe, i.e., attain the %0a%3c degree called "Moshe"; %0a%3c %0a%3c c) The word itself in its "corporeal" reading, its "corporeal" meaning %0a%3c indicates the spiritual root and its branch— consequence in our world; %0a%3c %0a%3c d) A combination of words indicates an entire spiritual process, which, %0a%3c as a rule, has a corresponding action (commandment) in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Names change depending on the aspect that requires clarification: %0a%3c %0a%3c a) By elements of Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - has none %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - fire %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - water %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - air %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c b) By colors: %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - has none %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - white - the basis of all colors %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - red - most prominent %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - green - most perfect %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - black - cannot be changed by any other color %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 129 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Colors are present only in the Guf (body) of the Partzuf, but never in the %0a%3c Rosh (head). These colors are projected onto Malchut from Above, and she passes %0a%3c them on to all the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c c) By lines: %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed - right - white %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura - left - red %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet - central, includes all the colors - green %0a%3c %0a%3c Quite often, colors and elements are used instead of the names of Sefirot %0a%3c and their properties: fire, water, air, earth (The Zohar, Vayera, item 32). Malchut %0a%3c is called "earth," but Malchut that ascends with her properties to Bina is called %0a%3c "earth of the Temple." In the Temple, the four sides of the world— Hochrna, Bina, %0a%3c Tifferet and Malchut join the four elements of the world— fire, water, air and %0a%3c earth. Out of the two points of Bina and Malchut, which are joined together, the %0a%3c Creator made one Partzuf— Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four foundations of the world, or the four sides of the world: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Fire %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c North %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shuruk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Left Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Air %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c East %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Middle Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Water %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c South %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Holam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Right Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c West %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut- receives from all %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Four fundamental metals are created as a result of a Zivug of the four %0a%3c foundations with Malchut; gold, silver, copper and iron. All of these names, as %0a%3c well as many others, are used in the Torah instead of the names of the ten Sefirot. %0a%3c Therefore, although the languages of the Torah, legends, the Talmud, and the %0a%3c Scriptures are extraordinarily vivid, only the concise language of Kabbalah %0a%3c provides an accurate description of the spiritual worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four kinds of symbols used with letters: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim— tone modulations used in pronouncing letters— signify the Direct %0a%3c Light, which spreads from Above downwards in the body of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot— letter punctuation marks— signify the Light during its gradual exit %0a%3c from the body of the Partzuf from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tagin— crowns above the letters— represent Reshimot (reminiscences/records) %0a%3c of the previously present Light (Taamim). Tagin originate from GAR de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 130 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Otiot— letters— represent Reshimot of the Light's exit from the body of the %0a%3c Partzuf (Nekudot). Letters originate from Zat de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten Sefirot are divided into three primary parts— Taamim, Nekudot, %0a%3c and Otiot: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim - Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Otiot - ZAT de Bina and ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the Light in them, Sefirot are divided into: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim - Hochma %0a%3c Nekudot - Bina %0a%3c Otiot - ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters were created in the following order: the letter Aleph, which was %0a%3c initially on the right side, begot the letter Shin, which emerged from it and %0a%3c moved to the left side. The letter Shin consists of three sides: the left, the middle, %0a%3c and the right. The letter Vav is thereby formed by three letters, and upon joining %0a%3c with Aleph, it formed the word Aleph-Shin = ESH (fire) in the left side. %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the interaction of the right and the left sides these two letters came %0a%3c forth in contradiction between them, as the right line includes water, while the %0a%3c left line includes fire. Their collisions begot the letters Reish, Vav, and Chet, %0a%3c which formed the word Ruach (wind). This wind entered between the two sides %0a%3c (fire and water) and joined them together, thereby establishing the order of the %0a%3c first letters and their perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, The Zohar offers a general description of the three lines in ZA, %0a%3c designated by the three names of the Creator: El, Elokim and Elokeinu, and then %0a%3c proceeds to clarify the descent of the degrees of filling ZA and Malchut with %0a%3c the Light of Hochma in the form of letter combinations, in the order of the %0a%3c degrees' descent from Above downwards. Mayim - water, Esh - fire, Ruach - %0a%3c wind constitute the three lines in ZA from AVI. This is why the first letters in %0a%3c ZA come from AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the following combinations emerged: Aleph revealed Mem from its %0a%3c right side, so Mem stands to the left line of Aleph. Mem revealed Shin as the %0a%3c middle line, as Mem initially consists of the left line, for it exists in the form of a %0a%3c concealed letter Mem in the word Elokim, which pertains to the left line, and so %0a%3c forth. This is how all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were born. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba 131 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS %0a%3c OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTERS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NAME %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PRONUNCIATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEMATRIA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c b,v %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gimel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c g %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Dalet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c d %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c v, [u], [o] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c T %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c z %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c h %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c t %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (1)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c h,k %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lamed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (0)8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c m %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 0)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nun %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Samech %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c V %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (1)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c p, ph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (r)s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c p %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c k %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Reish %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c r %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 200 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sh, s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 300 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c t %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 400 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Aleph and Ayin do not have any particular sound, and only %0a%3c the accompanying punctuation mark determines their pronunciation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Bet, Chaf and Peh with a dot inside them are pronounced %0a%3c as "b," "k," and "p." The absence of a dot changes their pronunciation to %0a%3c "v," "ch" and "f." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Hey is not pronounced, but rather aspirated. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shapes of the letters Mem, Nun, Tzadik, Peh, Chaf (pronounced %0a%3c MANTZEPACH) change when placed at the end of a word, as seen in the %0a%3c table of letters. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shape, external form of letters: the protruding element of a letter indicates %0a%3c that the Light in this part of the letter is greater than in the other. The filling %0a%3c (Miluy) indicates the height of the degree. A punctuation mark (Nikud) indicates %0a%3c the origin of each part of the Partzuf. whether it came from the Upper Partzuf (and %0a%3c constitutes its part in the present one), from the lower Partzuf, or from itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kelim-Sefirot themselves are called "letters," and their punctuation %0a%3c marks (Nekudot) indicate the Light that enters and exits them. The Light of Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut can enter the Kelim, but the Light of Keter or Hochma cannot. %0a%3c A dot above a letter (Holam) signifies the Lights Keter and Hochma, which never %0a%3c clothe the Kli, hence the location of the dot above the letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two horizontally positioned dots (Tzere) allude to Sefirot Hochma and Bina, %0a%3c that Bina does not receive the Light of Hochma, and contains only the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim, the Light of Mercy (AVI back-to-back). Bina herself is also called Tzere, %0a%3c for ZA receives everything from her. If there is a third dot (Segol) between these %0a%3c two dots, it means that ZA raised his request for the Light of Hochma to AVI. %0a%3c Such a request of ZA in AVI is called Daat. Daat receives the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in order to pass it on to ZA. The punctuation mark Kamatz (a "T" shaped mark %0a%3c under the letter) indicates that ZA collects (Mekabetz) the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c A dot indicates Malchut with a reflecting screen, but not a receiving one. %0a%3c Such a form testifies to the absence of Light in the Kli; it is merely a black dot, %0a%3c as the law of restriction rules over it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Hod is an inclusion of Malchut's properties into ZA, out of which %0a%3c ZA makes a whole Partzuf Malchut. The letter Hey in the word Hod signifies Keter %0a%3c in Malchut, and the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut are located among the impure %0a%3c forces that cling to them. This is designated by an elongated leg of the letter Kuf %0a%3c (dipping below the line), which indicates that the impure forces receive their %0a%3c strength from the spiritually pure forces through this element, the Kuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 133 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The white background is a plain, indistinguishable and thereby imperceptible %0a%3c Light (by us). Whatever we can distinguish may only be expressed by restricting %0a%3c the diffusion of this white color. The forms and degrees of its restriction are %0a%3c called letters. That is why we see black outlines on white background, and attain %0a%3c only the black restrictions. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can describe the diffusion of Light in the worlds using attraction and %0a%3c restriction of the Light. And these two forces must act simultaneously. Similarly, %0a%3c when we perceive something in our sensory organs, we only sense it by way of %0a%3c restriction, as the object's surface or a light wave collides with our sensory organ, %0a%3c which restricts its expansion, and can thereby perceive it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual roots of the forms are as follows: A circumference originates %0a%3c from the first restriction of the Light in the world of Em Sof (Infinity), the %0a%3c first restriction on the diffusion of Light. Since this restriction was equal and %0a%3c uniform, it assumed the form of a circumference. %0a%3c %0a%3c A vertical line, length without width, signifies that the notion is unattainable %0a%3c by us, and is therefore called a "thin line" of the diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c The Light of Hochma can only be received with the help of the screen in Malchut, %0a%3c which creates Returning Light that clothes the Light of Hochma. Therefore, the %0a%3c Upper Light that comes to the Kli is called a line. %0a%3c %0a%3c A horizontal line, width without height: when a vertical line— the diffusion %0a%3c of the Light of Hochma from Above downwards— collides with the screen, their %0a%3c collision (of desires) compels the vertical line to shift into the horizontal line (to %0a%3c the right), resulting in a shape of the English letter L. Its width is determined by the %0a%3c force of the Returning Light that ascends from the screen from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c A rectangle is formed by the interlacing of the descending Light of Hochma %0a%3c and the Returning Light: five vertical descending lines— five Sefirot of the Light %0a%3c of Hochma and five horizontal lines from right to left— five Sefirot of the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim. The size of the rectangle's side is called Amah, consisting of five %0a%3c parts— Tefachim (plural for Tefach). (Both Amah and Tefach are distance measuring %0a%3c units.) This is why we describe the Kli as a rectangle. %0a%3c %0a%3c The two kinds of diffusion of Light, the Light of Hochma and the Returning %0a%3c Light, are called the right and the left cheeks, respectively, which turn into the %0a%3c upper and the lower lips. Since, after the first restriction, the Light may not be %0a%3c received in Malchut, the Returning Light is only received in four parts of the Kli, %0a%3c not in five. This is why there are 4 x 4 = 16 teeth on the lower jaw and 16 teeth %0a%3c on the upper jaw (The Returning Light stems from resistance, from "chewing" %0a%3c the Light before receiving it inside). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 134 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the second restriction, a Triangle is formed, as Malchut ascends to Bina %0a%3c and forms a slanted line. Thus the combination of the Direct Light with the %0a%3c Returning Light and restrictions beget various spiritual forms. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Hassadirn is defined as "protruding," for a protrusion beyond %0a%3c the limits of a spiritual body means that: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The Light is so great that it comes out by elevating, protruding %0a%3c the limits; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) It originates from the middle line, Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c A cavity in the body occurs due to the following reasons: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The Light is insufficient; the Light cannot shine there; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) The Light of Hochrna is present, but the lack of Hassadirn prevents it %0a%3c from shining. %0a%3c %0a%3c PUNCTUATION MARKS %0a%3c IN THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a%3c (NEKUDOTj %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Punctuation Mark %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pronunciation %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kamatz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c T %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Patach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Segol %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzere %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shva %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Holam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kubutz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c u %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shuruk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c u %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c No Mark %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot are defined by three lines: %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE ROSH (HEAD) %0a%3c Kamatz - Keter - right line %0a%3c Patach - Hochma - left line %0a%3c Tzere - Bina - middle line %0a%3c Holam - Tifferet - middle line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 135 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE GUF (BODY) %0a%3c Segol - Hesed - right line %0a%3c Shva - Gevura - left line %0a%3c Shuruk - Tifferet - middle line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE EXTREMITIES %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c Kubutz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah - right line %0a%3c Hod - left line %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - middle line (has no designation) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The levels of Nelcudot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Above the letters - Light of Neshama %0a%3c In the letters - Light of Ruach %0a%3c Under the letters - Light of Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zivug de Nelcudot is the Zivug between Hochma de Aba and Hochma de Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c Zivug de Otiot is the Zivug between Bina de Aba and Bina de Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters combined together designate Returning Light during the screen's %0a%3c ascent from Tabur to Peh. They are combined, for they all ascend to their root, %0a%3c which unites everything, whereas the use of the will to receive, even for the %0a%3c Creator's sake, causes separation. %0a%3c %0a%3c A state of separated letters occurs when the Light enters the Kli (vessel, the %0a%3c letters of HaVaYaH); the four letters thereby separate, since the Light makes %0a%3c a distinction between the Sefirot: depending on their different properties, it %0a%3c clothes in them in different ways. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH with filling Aleph comes on a screen with Auiut Aleph (thickness %0a%3c one), HaVaYaH with filling Hey comes on a screen with Aviut Bet (thickness %0a%3c two). A plain name refers to Aviut Shoresh (zero thickness) with the Light of %0a%3c Ne/esh. Plain letters refer to a Partzuf with a screen of Aviut Aleph. %0a%3c %0a%3c The truly faithful, who believe in the three fundamentals: the Creator, His %0a%3c Providence and the Torah, need the two lines to be in constant balance for their %0a%3c spiritual advancement. The left line is wisdom, the Light of Hochma that enters %0a%3c the desire to receive, which pertains to the left side, and the right line is faith, %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim (mercy), the altruistic desire to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c Existing in knowledge only means that man is under the rule of the %0a%3c impure forces (Klipa) of the left side, which renders him totally unable to %0a%3c feel the spiritual, leaving him in spiritual darkness. Alternately, existing only %0a%3c in faith means that man is under the rule of the impure forces (Klipa) of the %0a%3c right side that convinces him that he has achieved perfection, that there is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 136 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nothing else to work on, nothing to correct within him. This, too, denies him %0a%3c the opportunity to advance. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar continues: And the Creator answered further (the letter Tav): %0a%3c "The word MaveT (death) ends with you. And since these are your properties, %0a%3c you are not suitable for Me to create the world with you." Immediately following, %0a%3c the letter Tav departed from Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moment the Creator set about creating the world-ZON by selecting %0a%3c their properties, all twenty-two letters of ZON appeared before Him, starting %0a%3c from the last— Tav, and ending with the first, Aleph— the head of all letters. The %0a%3c reason for the letters coming in reverse order is that they constitute the MAN %0a%3c of ZON, the Kelim of ZON, which emerge from below upwards. The usual %0a%3c alphabetical order corresponds to the Light (MAD), which descends from %0a%3c Above downwards. But the order of MAN is opposite to that of MAD, for it %0a%3c ascends from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are none other than desires, properties, and thoughts that, in man's %0a%3c opinion, are suitable for the attainment of the spiritual, the Creator, of His %0a%3c Providence. Man skips from one thought to another: one moment he thinks that %0a%3c it is possible to attain the Upper Worlds with one property, next he believes he %0a%3c can enter the spiritual realms by mastering another property, then he begins to %0a%3c stubbornly observe all the commandments and pray zealously, or disregards all %0a%3c the actions and plunges into contemplation and reading. Sometimes he craves %0a%3c only knowledge, and sometimes only faith, right down to fanaticism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as there are two extremes in our world— knowledge and faith, in the %0a%3c spiritual world, as man now consciously ascends the spiritual ladder to the %0a%3c Creator, there is spiritual work in the attainment of knowledge and faith. %0a%3c Hence, Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag's commentary on The Zohar is entitled The %0a%3c Sulam (The Ladder). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters represents a certain property. At times %0a%3c it seems that the property of the letter Tav is suitable for the attainment of the %0a%3c spiritual; at times he believes that some other letter is more appropriate. This %0a%3c occurs because in the process of his spiritual ascent, man begins to increasingly %0a%3c understand the true Goal of creation and the Creator, which is exactly what is %0a%3c demanded of him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, he continues to sort through it all, until his search yields the truth: %0a%3c only with the help of the letter Bet, which stands at the beginning of the word %0a%3c Berachah (blessing)— contact with the Creator,— only with the help of this force %0a%3c can one achieve the goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 137 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tuaiiy %0a%3c 5 into %0a%3c tually %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us how the letters— properties, forces, and desires- %0a%3c come to the Creator. By offering up his prayer (MAN), man asks for some %0a%3c property that seems like a real goal to him. And each letter tries to prove that %0a%3c it is best suited for the attainment of the sensation of the Creator and merging %0a%3c with Him. But the Creator shows that the best and the only letter is Bet, as only %0a%3c it can help man to establish contact with Him. This is why the Torah begins %0a%3c with this letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c The description of the spiritual forces designated by each letter is incredibly %0a%3c deep, and in order to attain full clarity we need to bridge several other preliminary %0a%3c explanations: the creation of the world includes its existence and process of %0a%3c perfection so that the world could attain the goal for which it was created. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator created the world consisting of two contrasting forces; against %0a%3c each pure, altruistic force, He created an impure, egoistic one, which is its equal %0a%3c and opposite. Just as there are four pure worlds ABYA, the Creator created %0a%3c opposite them four impure worlds ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, in our world— the last degree of the world of Assiya— a spiritually %0a%3c lved person that senses the Creator and has entered with his properties %0a%3c piritually pure world, looks no different from an egoistic and spirit %0a%3c developed person, who has not attained the spiritual realm. This means tha %0a%3c one who does not perceive the spiritual is totally unable to differentiate between %0a%3c piritual purity and impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c We see that in our world one cannot advance with the help of the pure %0a%3c forces. On the contrary, it is his egoistic aspirations that provide man with the %0a%3c strength to conquer everything in the world. How often do we see fervent fanatics %0a%3c immersed in their impure desires to capture for themselves both this world and %0a%3c the next, whereas one that aspires to the Creator has no strength for even a %0a%3c slightest spiritual movement! In our world there is no proof or confirmation %0a%3c that man advances on the right path. And under no circumstances should one %0a%3c draw conclusions based on one's life experience or "common sense." %0a%3c %0a%3c So how can a person in this world exist and advance towards the Goal of %0a%3c creation if he is unable to tell good from bad, pure from impure? There is one %0a%3c sign by which one can distinguish purity from impurity: impure forces bear %0a%3c no spiritual fruit. Thus, those that advance through the impure worlds ABYA %0a%3c do not attain anything spiritual, whereas those who are connected to the pure %0a%3c forces reap spiritual fruit on their path. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is explained in the "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot" (items %0a%3c 19-23), if man advances along the right path, he attains the secrets of the Torah in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c five years. The Creator helps those who wish to acquire altruistic i %0a%3c above their own requests, and thus one attains the desired goal, %0a%3c below, man aspires to the Creator with his small desire (MAN), and from Above, %0a%3c the Creator pours onto him tremendous spiritual desires and strength (MAD). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the only opportunity to check whether or not the path that one %0a%3c is on is correct, whether it leads to altruism or to even bigger egoism. By no %0a%3c means can one consider his well-being, soaring elation, his happiness and %0a%3c :cess in life as proofs of correct advancement. It is precisely in those state %0a%3c perfection, well-being, and contentment that he must ask himse %0a%3c lined the secrets of the Torah?" And until he has attained them, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e states %0a%3c limself: %0a%3c %0a%3c em ' h ' S %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c an %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c should always strive for the middle line— a balance of faith and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c knowledge— in the following three notions: the Creator, His Providence, and %0a%3c the Torah. And under no circumstances should he advance by either faith or %0a%3c knowledge alone. If he only wants to attain the Creator, His Providence or the %0a%3c ih, he enters spiritual darkness, for it is impossible to receive the Light ■ %0a%3c %0a%3c Light of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim). %0a%3c %0a%3c ; referred to as the left impure force, "Klipat Esau." %0a%3c strives to advance through faith alone, he enters the impure force of the %0a%3c side, "Klipat Yishmael," which tells him he is in a state of perfection. In this ca %0a%3c he sees no point in his work and is thus unable to continue to advance. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, even if one is full of joy, which is exactly what the Torah %0a%3c urges him to feel (to perceive the Creator's Providence with joy, for joy signifies %0a%3c justification of creation, understanding that His Providence is always just and %0a%3c unless he has attained the secrets of the Torah, his path is consider %0a%3c intention "for the Creator's sal %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This article explains the particular properties of the Hebrew letters— how all %0a%3c the letters come before the Creator, each asking Him to create the world with its %0a%3c property. Each of the twenty-two letters represents a spiritual degree in the worlds %0a%3c ABYA, and each believes that its pure spiritual properties are most suitable for %0a%3c the task, that by attaining its degree and acquiring its properties, the inhabitants %0a%3c of the world will be able to elevate the pure forces over the impure ones, so much %0a%3c so that they will reach the end of correction, the Goal of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator answers each letter that against it are the corresponding %0a%3c impure forces, and therefore man will be unable to properly separate the pure %0a%3c forces from the impure ones, and afterwards, utilize the pure forces to achieve %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 139 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the goal. This occurrence repeats itself until the appearance of the letter Bet, %0a%3c which represents the degree called "the Creator's blessing," against which there %0a%3c are no impure forces of any kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator consented to create the world with the letter Bet, with its %0a%3c property; for it has no impure counterpart, only Bet presents an opportunity %0a%3c to carry out an analysis between good and evil, to determine when man works %0a%3c for himself and when he works for the Creator's sake. Therefore, only by its %0a%3c force, by its property can the world exist: so as to extract from the "mixture" %0a%3c of one's desires only what's pure, and elevate them above the impure, down to %0a%3c complete eradication of the latter, and the consequent attainment of complete %0a%3c correction of one's nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it follows from The Zohar, only the Creator's help, called "a blessing," is %0a%3c the force of man's salvation, the only thing capable of freeing him from the rule %0a%3c of the impure forces. And this force, called "blessing," descends only upon those %0a%3c that advance along the right path. %0a%3c %0a%3c The right path is a combination of three conditions: (i) one's efforts in %0a%3c idying (only!) genuine Kabbalistic sources; (ii) contact with a true Kabbalist, %0a%3c accepts as his teacher; and (iii) contact with like-minded people, who %0a%3c eek spiritual elevation. A more detailed explanation will be provided to serious %0a%3c students only. %0a%3c %0a%3c All twenty-two letters are divided into three degrees: Bina, Zeir Anpin (ZA), %0a%3c and Malchut, since there are no Kelim (letters) above Bina. Twenty-two letters in %0a%3c Bina are called "big," twenty-two letters in ZA are called "medium," and twenty- %0a%3c two letters in Malchut are called "small." %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the three Sefirot of Bina, ZA, and Malchut are further divided into %0a%3c three degrees: The twenty-two letters of Bina contain their own Bina, ZA, and %0a%3c Malchut. Likewise, ZA has his own ten Sefirot, in which his Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a%3c also contain twenty-two letters. The same applies to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The twenty-two letters of each degree are divided into three types. The letters %0a%3c from Aleph to Tet (1-9) are considered units; these are the nine Sefirot of Bina. %0a%3c The letters from Yod to Tzadik (10-90) are considered tens; these are the nine %0a%3c Sefirot of ZA. And finally, the four letters Kuf, Reish, Shin and Tav (100-400) are %0a%3c considered hundreds; and these are the four Sefirot of Malchut, since Malchut is %0a%3c located below and downwards of Chazeh de ZA, which corresponds in height to %0a%3c the four Sefirot of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina, units, big letters, nine letters: Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Hey, Vav, %0a%3c Zayin, Chet, Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 140 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA, tens, medium letters, nine letters: Yod, Chaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Sarnech, %0a%3c Ayin, Peh, Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, hundreds, small letters, four letters: Kuf, Reish, Shin, Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, it is known that units are in Malchut, tens are in ZA, and hundreds %0a%3c are in Bina, which contradicts the aforesaid that units are in Bina, tens are in %0a%3c ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. Such inverse dependence is caused by the %0a%3c inverse relationship between the Lights and the Kelim: the lowest Light enters %0a%3c the Highest Kelim. The Upper Kelim are the first to emerge, from Keter down to %0a%3c Malchut (Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut), whereas the first to enter them %0a%3c is the smallest Light, Ne/esh, followed by Ruach, Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if there are only units in the Kelim, from Aleph to Tet, then only %0a%3c the Light of Ne/esh is present. And if tens are added to the Kelim, the Light of %0a%3c Ruach appears, and if hundreds are added to the Kelim, the Light of Neshama %0a%3c fills them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why hundreds are defined as Bina, tens as ZA, and units as Malchut. %0a%3c However, with regard to the Kelim, the order is inversed: units are in Bina, tens %0a%3c are in ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters descend from Bina to ZA and from there to Malchut. When they %0a%3c descend from Bina to ZA, they descend as three lines: 22/3 = 7 letters in each, with %0a%3c the remaining letter being added to the middle line. These twenty-two letters de- %0a%3c scend in three lines to Malchut, which consists of five final letters MANTZEPACH, %0a%3c thereby bringing the total number in Malchut to 22 + 5 = 27 letters. %0a%3c %0a%3c The middle line is called "Heaven," "firmament." Therefore, when The %0a%3c Zohar speaks of letters in the firmament, it means that the two middle lines, %0a%3c 7 + 7 = 14 = Yod + Dalet = Yad (hand) writes all the twenty-two letters in the %0a%3c firmament (ZA) through the middle line. That is how one should interpret the %0a%3c words of the Torah regarding the letters that appear in the sky or having seen the %0a%3c hand that writes the letters in the sky. %0a%3c %0a%3c The twenty-two letters of the Torah are the Kelim to be filled by the Light %0a%3c of NRN. Units— from Aleph to Yod— are the Kli intended for the Light of Bina %0a%3c (Neshama). Tens— from Yod to Kuf— are the Kli meant for the Light of ZA {Ruach). %0a%3c Hundreds— from Kuf to Tav— are the Kli for the Light of Malchut (Ne/esh). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina: Light (100) %0a%3c ZA: Light (10) %0a%3c Malchut: Light (1) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kelim (1) %0a%3c Kelim (10) %0a%3c Kelim (100) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 141 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are the Kelim, into which the Light clothes; in all, there are twenty- %0a%3c two special properties, and thus twenty-two symbols of their description, %0a%3c called letters. Just as the combinations of the twenty-two letters suffice for the %0a%3c description of all existing knowledge, the various couplings, unions (Zivugim of %0a%3c Sefirot) of the twenty-two Kelim, properties, desires of the Partzuf are sufficient %0a%3c for receiving and bestowing Light, fulfilling all spiritual actions and bringing all %0a%3c the letters (man's desires) to correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters represent the various correlations of ZON: %0a%3c %0a%3c a) ZA, consisting of six parts of his extremities, husband to Malchut, %0a%3c designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Yesod— level of an embryo; %0a%3c %0a%3c b) ZA designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Tifferet, consisting of six parts of %0a%3c his hands— level of nursing; %0a%3c %0a%3c c) ZA that stands between AVI, while Nukva must ascend to him, thereby %0a%3c reaching the level of reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c d) ZA, the letter Vav, above him are ten Sefirot Keter-Hochma, below him %0a%3c are ten Sefirot Bina-Tifferet-Malchut—and together they make up the %0a%3c letter Aleph. And the final corrected state will come when Malchut %0a%3c ascends to Keter of ZA (the Upper Yod in the letter Aleph) at the end %0a%3c of correction. When Malchut ascends above Parsa (Vav), she receives %0a%3c the Light herself, whereas when she descends below Vav, she receives %0a%3c from ZA. As Malchut ascends, she forms Taamim (tone marks), when %0a%3c she descends, she is called Nekuda (point), and when she merges with %0a%3c ZA, she is referred to as a point inside Vav (Shuruk). %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of ATBaSH: There is a special combination of letters, e.g. the %0a%3c first with the last ('A' through 'T'), the second with the second last ('B' through %0a%3c 'Sh'), etc., which designate the conditions for diffusion of the Upper Light from %0a%3c Above downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c MANTZEPACH: All the worlds and Partzufim were created with the %0a%3c twenty-two letters of Malchut. The screen is located in the head of the Partzuf, %0a%3c preventing the Light from entering. It repels the Light, calculates how much it %0a%3c can receive for the Creator's sake, and only then accepts it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the five levels of the will to receive that exist in Malchut, in the Guf %0a%3c of the Partzuf, has a corresponding restriction in the screen, located in the Peh, %0a%3c to prevent the Light from entering the body. Therefore, the screen in the Peh %0a%3c consists of five parts, forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 142 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These five restrictive forces of the screen, five exertions of the screen are %0a%3c designated by the five final letters of the alphabet: Mem-Nun-Tzadik-Peh-Chaf %0a%3c (abbreviated as MANTZEPACH). They are called "final letters" because they %0a%3c are written only at the end of words. These forces determine the reception %0a%3c of Light in the body of the Partzuf, and therefore beget the other twenty-two %0a%3c letters (Kelim, corrected desires, which receive the Light). Although the five %0a%3c letters MANTZEPACH are only found at the end of words, in oral speech they %0a%3c represent the five groups of pronunciation of the twenty-two letters. And the %0a%3c letters MANTZEPACH stand at the head of each group. %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the five letters MANTZEPACH originate five groups of sounds: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Peh-Keter: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the throat; they are %0a%3c called AChHA—Aleph-Chet-Hey-Ayin. Aleph is the Light of Partzuf Keter of Atzilut, %0a%3c concealed from the lower ones and called Atik. Chet is the Light of Partzuf Hochma %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut, called Arich Anpin and also concealed from the lower %0a%3c ones. Hey is the Light of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, called Ima (mother), %0a%3c who receives the Light of Hochma from Aba (father) in order to pass it on to her %0a%3c children (ZON). Ayin is the Light of Zeir Anpin 's face. Since the Light of ZA that %0a%3c enters Malchut is called "the Torah," it is said that the Torah has Ayin (70) faces, %0a%3c that the Creator (ZA) has Ayin (70) names. After all, with regard to Malchut, ZA is %0a%3c the Creator. Therefore, seventy souls descended to Egypt, and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Chaf-Hochma-. a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the palate; %0a%3c they are called GlChiK— Gimel-Yod-Chaf-Kuf. The letters AChHA transfer the %0a%3c Light to the letters GlChiK: Aleph passes the Light to Gimel, which carries reward %0a%3c (Gemul— Gimel) for the righteous. Chet passes the Light of Hochma to Yod, but this %0a%3c Light is concealed. Hey illuminates Chaf with the Light of Bina, which carries %0a%3c joy. Ayin illuminates Kuf. Just as Ayin = 70, as it consists of seven Sefirot, Hesed- %0a%3c Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, each containing ten Sefirot of its own, %0a%3c Kuf = 100, as it consists of ten Sefirot from Keter to Malchut, each consisting of %0a%3c its own ten. Hence, the palate fully complements the throat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. Nun-Bina: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the tongue, called %0a%3c DaTLaT— Dalet-Tet- Lamed- 'Nun-Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. Mem-ZA: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the lips, called %0a%3c BOMoCH-Bet-Vav-Mem-Cka/. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Tzadik-Malchut: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the teeth, %0a%3c called ZaSSHRaTZ - Zayin-Samech-Shin-Reish-Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Voice and speech: Voice is formed in ZA, speech— in Malchut. If he who %0a%3c is righteous, and who exists in the worlds BYA, raises his prayers (MAN) to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 143 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut of the world of Atzilut, he causes ZON to ascend to AVI, and unites %0a%3c them in a constant Zivug so as to assure the Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a%3c ZON receives the Light from AVI; this Light is called "voice" and "speech," %0a%3c and this is the power of the righteous— to create the pure and destroy the %0a%3c impure with their voice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's speech is conceived in the lungs: as the air exits the lungs and %0a%3c reaches the mouth, it turns to voice, and as it leaves the mouth, it becomes %0a%3c speech. Two lips accept the voice from the two parts of the lungs (the left and %0a%3c the right) and turn it into speech. Each lung consists of five parts so as to %0a%3c pass to the five parts in the mouth: to the guttural letters AChHA, the labial %0a%3c letters BOMoCH, the palatal letters GlChiK, the lingual letters DaTLaT and %0a%3c the dental letters ZaSSHRaTZ. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a%3c names of ZA originate from the seventy (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is %0a%3c called "Heaven," and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also known %0a%3c as Ruach (because of the Light of Ruach in them), which ascends to Bina (ears), %0a%3c where it turns to sound, with Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TAV %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the twenty-two letters corresponds to a particular spiritual degree, on %0a%3c which it acts. The letter itself is that spiritual degree. Hence, the letter Tav claims %0a%3c that its properties are the most suitable for the creation of the world, that its %0a%3c properties can bring the world to correction and to the goal of creation, for it %0a%3c defines the property of "truth," the Creator's seal. %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces exist solely on account of the miniature Light received %0a%3c from the pure forces; this Light is called Ner Dakik (tiny candle). Without this %0a%3c Light, the impure forces would neither be able to exist nor to function— tempting %0a%3c man with the pleasures they received from the tiny spark of Light that fell from %0a%3c the pure Sefirot. Therefore, the last, lowest pure degree lets a little bit of the %0a%3c Upper Light down to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without the support of the pure forces, the impure forces would instantly %0a%3c disappear. A question arises: who needs them to exist and what for? Obviously, %0a%3c the impure forces were created on a par with pure ones by the Creator Himself, %0a%3c for there is no other power in the entire universe besides Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was necessary to create impure forces in order to concentrate them in %0a%3c the enormous desires to receive pleasure, in immense egoism. The system of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 144 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the impure worlds of ABYA serves as a kind of storehouse of desires to receive %0a%3c pleasure, from which, to the extent of his correction, man can take more and %0a%3c more new desires so as to correct them. Thus, by attaching uncorrected impure %0a%3c forces to himself and correcting them, man can gradually ascend higher and %0a%3c higher, up to the level of the Creator. For this purpose the Creator created %0a%3c impure forces and sustains them through the system of pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure system of the worlds ABYA exists on the same level, parallel to %0a%3c the pure one. Our world is located under these two spiritual systems. Our world %0a%3c is also called egoistic and impure, but its forces and desires are so insignificant %0a%3c that they are located below the worlds of the impure ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c When, with the help of Kabbalah, one surmounts the level of our world's %0a%3c egoism, he enters the pure world of Assiya. And immediately after, the impure %0a%3c world of Assiya begins to influence him, tempting him with its false pleasures. %0a%3c By overcoming the temptations of the impure world of Assiya, one ascends %0a%3c spiritually. But until one surmounts the impure desires of his body, of our %0a%3c world, he will not begin to sense, or enter the spiritual worlds, for he would not %0a%3c be able to withstand the impure forces that act there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unlike the forces that act in the spiritual world, man in our world is only %0a%3c influenced by the small egoistic force called his "body," his ego. Man can struggle %0a%3c with this force, either winning or losing his battles. But even if he is defeated, %0a%3c man retains that tiny spark of Light (Ner Dakik), which sustains his existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag gives the following example: man's work in this world %0a%3c resembles writing on a school blackboard, where any mistake may be wiped off %0a%3c lout harming the writer, where he can make corrections and write anew, %0a%3c le learns to write correctly. Only when he learns to write correctly is %0a%3c to enter the spiritual realm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, our world is the most insignificant of all. Everyone must begin %0a%3c here, and everyone is bound to return here, and be born again and again until %0a%3c he crosses the boundary between our world and the spiritual one. (There are %0a%3c many additional conditions required for the soul to not descend to this world %0a%3c anymore, and those who will merit, will understand). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the vertical line, the leg of the letter Kuf, descends below the writing %0a%3c line, which signifies the Light descending through this letter down to the impure %0a%3c forces. And no other letter descends below the writing line, like the Kuf does. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the impure forces to exist (any creature, whether pure or impure, can %0a%3c only exist by receiving Light), the last, lowest degree of pure forces descends into %0a%3c the impure forces and gives them the Light necessary for their existence and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s anew, %0a%3c ly is he %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 145 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c realization of their role: to entice man with their pleasures and convince him to %0a%3c act according to the law of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, the left leg of the letter Tav also descended below the writing line. %0a%3c But the Creator saw that the impure forces would then be too closely connected %0a%3c to pure ones, so He severed this connection and returned the left leg of the %0a%3c letter Tav back to the writing line, to the level of the pure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of this shortening, the left leg of the Tav doubled in thickness, %0a%3c as it folded in two, and no Light passes to the impure forces anymore. On the %0a%3c contrary, it even becomes the Creator's seal by holding the impure forces at bay %0a%3c and preventing them from stealing the Upper Light, for as soon as any impure %0a%3c forces touch it, they instantly die. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the life-force necessary for the sustenance of the impure forces is %0a%3c passed by the Creator through the letter Kuf, because, being the first letter of %0a%3c Malchut, it is remote from them; thus, there is no fear or risk that its connection %0a%3c to the impure forces would become too strong. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of only four letters from Above downwards: Kuf, Reish, %0a%3c Shin, and Tav. Kuf is the first, Tav is the last, and below it are the impure %0a%3c forces. Therefore, if they receive the Light they need according to the thought %0a%3c of creation from Kuf, the furthest letter from them, the impure forces have %0a%3c no way of "stealing" more Light than Malchut, who consists of four letters, is %0a%3c obliged to give them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why this letter is called Kuf, to show that it gives strength to the %0a%3c impure system of ABYA— a fake (nonexistent) man, just as a monkey (Kof in %0a%3c Hebrew) resembles a human being. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it misleads people by pretending to be the truth and claiming that its %0a%3c path leads to the attainment of spirituality, the Creator, Lishma, the sensation %0a%3c of the Creator. However, the pure forces maintain that only with the help of the %0a%3c Torah can man attain adequate correction of his properties so as to merge them %0a%3c with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is what the letter Tav claimed: because it is the Creator's seal of %0a%3c truth, it stands at the end of the pure system and does not allow the impure %0a%3c forces to cling to pure ones, and pose as if they are pure. This is why its %0a%3c properties are worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world— so %0a%3c that via the analysis of good and evil, purity and impurity, inhabitants of this %0a%3c world may be sure that by acquiring its properties they will achieve the goal %0a%3c of their creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 146 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The four letters Kuf-Reish-Shin-Tav make up the four Sefirot of Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut: Keter-Hochma-Bina-Tifferet, where Tifferet consists of six Sefirot— %0a%3c Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. But when the letter Kuf is by itself, without %0a%3c Reish-Shin-Tav, the Torah, which spreads to the worlds BYA, also shines upon the %0a%3c impure forces, and the angel of death receives the strength to destroy all that %0a%3c lives. This state is designated by the letter Kuf. But when Malchut is corrected, %0a%3c she is designated by the letter Hey, whose difference from Kuf lies in the long leg %0a%3c of the Kuf (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c This long left leg, which turns the Hey into Kuf, indicates that the Light %0a%3c descends from the pure forces (Partzufim) to the impure worlds of BYA, the %0a%3c impure forces referred to as death. And when Malchut joins with Bina and %0a%3c receives the strength from Bina to ascend and receive the Light, the other letters %0a%3c join Malchut, and she draws the Light of life from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this state, the left leg of the Kuf is reduced in half, turning the Kuf into %0a%3c Tav, whose left leg is twice as thick, due to its shortening. The part of Malchut %0a%3c that passed Light to the impure forces now ascended out of them, hence there %0a%3c are two kinds of Malchut: Miftacha (key)— the part that joined with Bina, and %0a%3c Man'ula (lock)— the part that ascended out of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c These two parts of Malchut manifest in different ways: Miftacha— openly and %0a%3c Man'ula— secretly. Two paths of bringing man to correction emerge from them: %0a%3c the good path of the Torah and the path of suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Malchut corrects her properties and joins with Bina, she no %0a%3c longer parts from Bina, but, upon receiving Light from her, Malchut pours it %0a%3c onto the worlds, and the impure forces lose their strength to sow death and rule %0a%3c over the world. And if a case arises where a sinner must be punished, the impure %0a%3c forces must first receive permission to punish him, for without permission they %0a%3c may not reveal the Man'ula. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, after Malchut joins with Bina, thereby correcting her properties, the %0a%3c impure forces are no longer free to rule the world, unless they are permitted. %0a%3c The reason for this is the letter Tet, the last letter of Bina, which sends the Light %0a%3c of life to all with the help of the Miftacha. After Malchut joins with Bina, she %0a%3c becomes a Miftacha, and does not let go of this connection. Respectively, the %0a%3c impure forces, the leg of the letter Kuf, can no longer sow death. %0a%3c %0a%3c Three places emerge from this: (i) where only the properties of the letter %0a%3c Tet rule by shining with the Light of life of this world; (ii) the entire world after %0a%3c Malchut joins with Bina, defined as Miftacha, when the letter Tet shines upon %0a%3c all, but permits the punishment of sinners according to the rule: "You advance %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 147 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c towards the goal either by the path of the Torah or by the path of suffering"; (iii) %0a%3c hell, the place of eternal punishment by the letter Kuf, in contrast with the first %0a%3c place, ruled by the letter Tet, where life is eternally prosperous. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the letters with all their secret properties, described by those who %0a%3c understand them, are located in the Temple. All the Upper and lower worlds %0a%3c are created and function in the framework of their laws-properties, and the %0a%3c Supernal Name, the Creator's name HaVaYaH rules over all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mishkan (tabernacle) in the Temple was also designed with the help of %0a%3c letters, for its builder, Betzalel, knew how to join the letters that made Heaven %0a%3c and earth. And since he was unique in possessing this wisdom, he was entrusted %0a%3c with the building of the sanctuary. %0a%3c %0a%3c As the Creator chose Betzalel Above, so He wished him to be chosen below, %0a%3c as He said to Moshe Above: "Choose Betzalel." So Moshe said to his people %0a%3c below: "The Creator has chosen Betzalel." For such was Betzalel's name-property %0a%3c (Be Tzel El)— "In the Creator's shadow." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator is called ZA or the Sefira Tifferet in Partzuf ZA, which shines %0a%3c upon the Sefira Yesod, called Tzadik (righteous one). Betzalel is called Yesod, %0a%3c which receives the Light of VAK— an incomplete Light— from Tifferet, which is %0a%3c hence called "sitting in the shadow," and, in turn, shining into Malchut. Thus, %0a%3c like Tifferet, the Sefira Yesod that passes this Light also consists of six Sefirot: Hesed- %0a%3c Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name of the letter Tav, "truth," indicates that in order to reach its %0a%3c level, its degree, one must attain the property of truth. Therefore, the letter Tav %0a%3c claimed that with its properties man can fully analyze good and evil, renounce %0a%3c his impure desires as false, and to the degree that he renounces them, draw %0a%3c closer to the pure desires (forces), and thereby be certain that he will reach the %0a%3c goal of creation— correction of all his desires (Gmar Tikkun, end of correction). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ruly ask Him for help." For only with His help can one achieve correctior %0a%3c and spiritual elevation. However, this help only comes to those who genuinely, %0a%3c "truly" demand it. As soon as man is able to cry out wholeheartedly for the %0a%3c Creator's help, he instantly receives it. And if he does not receive an answer %0a%3c from the Creator— it is a sign that his request is not yet complete, that he did not %0a%3c yet fully realize his egoistic nature and properties as worthless, has not yet fully %0a%3c felt his helplessness and inability to exit and correct his properties by himself. %0a%3c This is why letter Tav was certain that once man acquires its property of truth, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 148 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered her that it is not worthy of becoming the basis %0a%3c of creation, for the forces of judgment that would arise from it would be so %0a%3c strong that even the complete righteous, who fulfilled the entire Torah from %0a%3c Aleph to Tav (A to Z) and reached the property of truth, will nevertheless be %0a%3c punished by it, for they have not destroyed all the sinners, as it is written in %0a%3c the Talmud (Shabbat, 55). %0a%3c %0a%3c Furthermore, the Creator declines its request, for it is also the seal of %0a%3c death, as its power brought death to this world. For man is bound to die, as the %0a%3c serpent forged its seal and deceived Adam in his understanding of the Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge. This is why the world cannot exist with its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER SHIN %0a%3c %0a%3c 24. The letter Shin appeared before the Creator and said: "Maker of the %0a%3c world, it befits the world to be created with me, for Your own name Shadday %0a%3c begins with me." The Creator replied: "You are fine, handsome, and truthful, %0a%3c but since the letters (properties) of the word Sheker (falsehood) took you to %0a%3c be with them, I cannot create the world with your properties, for SheKeR %0a%3c (falsehood) exists only because the letters Kuf and Reish took you." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of ten Sefirot and has two endings: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) If she has only her own properties, she contains all ten Sefirot, from %0a%3c Keter de Malchut to Malchut de Malchut. In this case she firmly restricts %0a%3c the diffusion of Light and is designated by the letter Tav; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) If Ima-Bina of the world of At^ilut fills Malchut with her Light, Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut ends not in the Sefira Malchut, but in the Sefira Yesod, and is %0a%3c designated by the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The three tips of the letter Shin are called its crown and signify the Light of %0a%3c Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), which descends from Partzuf Ima-Bina %0a%3c into Partzuf Malchut. This Light of Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), %0a%3c creates new altruistic properties in Malchut, altruistic intentions to receive the %0a%3c Light for the Creator's sake, after which Partzuf Malchut can receive the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma (Light of Wisdom) from ZA (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 22). When bonded %0a%3c so, ZA and Malchut are called "husband and wife," and the Light that Malchut %0a%3c receives from ZA is called 'TOO blessings." %0a%3c %0a%3c This new ending of Part^u/Malchut in the Sefira Yesod instead of in the Sefira %0a%3c Malchut is therefore called Yesod de Nukva or "the central point of existence," %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 149 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for all that exists in the world originates from it and exists thanks to it. Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut is the sum of all the creatures, and we are all its parts. All the worlds %0a%3c and all that inhabit them constitute various parts of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Upper Partzuf is considered the Creator of its adjacent lower Partzuf, %0a%3c for the latter originates (born) from it. Therefore, in relation to all the crea- %0a%3c tures, Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut is considered and called "the Creator," %0a%3c our Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And, like the Tav, the letter Shin is called "truth" and "the Creator's seal," %0a%3c for a seal signifies the end of a spiritual object— Partzuf, like a seal fixed at the %0a%3c end of a letter, written in the name of the Creator. The Creator's seal is similar %0a%3c to Himself; this is why the seal is called the mark of truth, for only the pres- %0a%3c ence of a seal gives a letter the force of truth, and confirms the truthfulness %0a%3c of its content. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the significance of the letter Shin is greater than that of the letter %0a%3c Tav, for Shin is the first letter of the word Shadday, one of the Creator's names- %0a%3c properties, designating His power, by which He said "Dai" (enough) to creation- %0a%3c stop and do not descend further (Talmud, Hagigah, 12)— do not descend below %0a%3c the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c This reveals that the world and its inhabitants can only exist with the help %0a%3c of the letter Shin, thanks to its property that restricts the diffusion of Light. %0a%3c The Creator said: "Stop, Creature, at the letter Shin, and do not spread to the %0a%3c letter Tav," for if the Light had spread to Tav, the impure forces would have %0a%3c received such great strength that man would have no hope of escaping them and %0a%3c reaching altruistic properties. This is why the ending point of Shin is called "the %0a%3c central point of existence." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the letter Shin saw the Creator refuse the letter Tav, precisely %0a%3c because ending the diffusion of Light with Tav creates conditions for correction %0a%3c of the world that are too difficult for man to meet, the letter Shin claimed that %0a%3c its property of Shadday is suitable for the creation of the world, and was certain %0a%3c that the Creator would choose it— its properties— as the basis of creation, for %0a%3c it possesses all the advantages that Tav lacked, which was the reason for the %0a%3c Creator's refusal. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it has Tav 's advantage, as well: it is the Creator's seal— truth. Moreover, %0a%3c it has an additional advantage: it is called by the name Shadday, the new ending %0a%3c of Malchut for the inhabitants of the world, instead of the ending by the property %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 150 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the letter Tav. Based on all that, the letter Shin found the strength and courage %0a%3c to appear before the Creator with the proposition to create the world with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered that precisely because of Shin's additional %0a%3c advantages compared to those of the letter Tav, the impure forces opposite it %0a%3c are strengthened. For opposite each letter (spiritually pure forces or properties) %0a%3c there is an opposing impure force (egoistic desire), as it is written: "The Creator %0a%3c had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%3c %0a%3c The strengthening of the impure forces from the properties of the letter Shin %0a%3c occurred as a result of her properties joining the impure properties of falsehood, %0a%3c forging spiritual purity of the letters Kuf and Reish: falsehood would be unable %0a%3c to exist in the world, for it would be recognized at once, had the letters Kuf and %0a%3c Reish not put Shin at the head of the word SheKeR (falsehood). And when truth %0a%3c stands at the head of the word that designates the property of falsehood, man %0a%3c naturally tends to err. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sources of impure forces: the first is a small luminescence %0a%3c (Ner Dakik), which the pure force itself (the Creator) sends to the impure forces %0a%3c (desires) so as to sustain them. This is done so they would not disappear until %0a%3c there is a need to "punish" the sinners with them. However, these are small %0a%3c forces— their height is not great, for they receive only a small luminescence, %0a%3c sufficient to sustain their life. %0a%3c %0a%3c This small luminescence descends into the impure forces from the letter %0a%3c Kuf, which results in these impure forces becoming similar to man in the %0a%3c worlds BYA, as a monkey in comparison to a human being, as it is said: "The %0a%3c Creator had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%3c %0a%3c The second source of impure forces arises from the lower ones' spiritual fall: %0a%3c as a result of people's evil, egoistic actions, the Light passes from the system of %0a%3c the pure forces into the impure. And the first transgression is Adam's sin, by %0a%3c which the system of the impure forces assumed an identical formation to that of %0a%3c the pure system, stationing itself opposite, parallel to it. As a result, the impure %0a%3c worlds ABYA emerged opposite the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second source of impure forces is the letter Reish, which indicates that %0a%3c the impure forces rise and attach themselves to the pure forces, right up to the %0a%3c level of Bina of Malchut, designated by the letter Dalet. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was previously stated, the twenty-two letters of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut are divided in three groups of letters: units in Bina, tens in ZA, %0a%3c and hundreds in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 151 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTERS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BIN A (IMA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MALCHUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Alepk-Bet-Gimel correspond to Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina, called %0a%3c "the head" of a spiritual object (Partzuf). The letters from Dalet to Tet refer to the %0a%3c body of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEAD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gimel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Dalet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BODY %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The body only receives what descends to it from the head. Therefore, Dalet, %0a%3c the first letter of the body, through which the body receives Light from the head, %0a%3c is called Dalah ve Aniyah (poor and destitute). Dalet only receives what Gimel gives %0a%3c it. Since Gimel contains the Light of Hassadim, that is, what descends into Dalet. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is why the letter Gimel is called Gomel Hassadim (merciful One) %0a%3c (Talmud, Shabbat, 104), according to its action with regard to Dalet, which would %0a%3c otherwise be completely without Light. The protruding sharp angle on the right %0a%3c side of Dalet is the sign of Dalet's abundance of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 152 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, opposite the pure (altruistic) Malchut, stands the impure Malchut, %0a%3c who is pride and does not wish to receive the Light from Gimel and rely on it. %0a%3c Instead, she rises up in the desire to be the head, and in so creates the sharp %0a%3c angle of the Dalet. That indicates that the presence of Ohr Hassadim disappears, %0a%3c transforming it into the letter Reish, which is written as it is pronounced— with %0a%3c two letters: Reish and Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The true merging of the pure ZA and Malchut is called ECHaD (one), %0a%3c consists of the letters Aleph, Chet and Dalet, for the letters from Aleph to Chet %0a%3c are the nine Sefirot of ZA. He passes the Light from Gimel of Bina to Gimel of %0a%3c Malchut, resulting in Malchut being filled with the Light of Hassadim, thereby %0a%3c becoming Dalet with a protruding right angle. As a result of this, ZA and %0a%3c Malchut become one. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the lower ones (people) sin in their actions (intentions), they give %0a%3c the impure Malchut the strength to cling to the pure one— Dalet, to erase the %0a%3c sharp angle of the Light of Hassadim and turn it into the letter Reish. Thus, %0a%3c the word Echad (one) becomes Acher (other, alien, foreign): Ale£>h-Chet-Dalet of %0a%3c the word Echad are transformed into Aleph-Chet-Reish of the word Acher, for %0a%3c instead of the connection with the Creator emerges a connection with other, %0a%3c impure forces, called "Elokim Acherim" (other gods), which cling to ZA and %0a%3c Malchut of the pure world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This leads to the letters Kuf and Reish distorting the Creator's seal (Shin), %0a%3c the letter of truth. As a result, Yesod of Malchut, which receives from Yesod de ZA, %0a%3c becomes linked to the impure source instead of the pure, for a new Yesod of the %0a%3c impure Malchut was formed with the help of the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c From here the impure forces develop up to ten Sefirot with a head and a %0a%3c body, whereas Shin becomes the source of all that desolates, for destruction of %0a%3c purity begets impurity. And from this emerged the system of the impure worlds %0a%3c ABYA of the impure man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we have learned how the letters Kuf and Reish became the two %0a%3c sources of emergence and development of impure forces. And since the impure %0a%3c forces pose as pure, they are called false, counterfeit letters whose purpose is to %0a%3c annihilate the system of the pure forces and their unity with the Creator, so as %0a%3c to forge themselves out of the devastation of the pure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The birth of the impure forces from the destruction of the pure ones %0a%3c is possible on account of the letter Shin, Yesod of Malchut, joining with the %0a%3c impure forces as a result of the forging of the letter Reish out of Dalet. Thereby, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 153 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Echad turns into Acher, and the system of the impure forces (Elokim Acherim, %0a%3c other gods) is created. %0a%3c %0a%3c And had the letters Kuf and Reish not captured the letter Shin, such an %0a%3c enormous system of impure forces, so capable of lying and falsifying everything %0a%3c in the eyes of man, would not have come into being. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator answered the letter Shin: "Though you are good, you %0a%3c will stand at the head of the word Sheker (falsehood) together with the letters %0a%3c Kuf and Reish. Indeed, upon capturing you, with your power they will be able %0a%3c to create an entire system of impure forces of falsehood and forgery. Hence, I %0a%3c cannot create the world with your properties, for since there is an impure system %0a%3c opposite from you, it is impossible to achieve the goal of creation with you." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS KUF AND REISH %0a%3c %0a%3c 25. From the aforesaid, it follows that whoever wishes to tell a lie will succeed %0a%3c if he first tells the truth as a base on which the lie will then grow and start %0a%3c to act. And this is because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, in which the %0a%3c Patriarchs had been united, for the three lines in the writing of the letter %0a%3c Shin (w) signify the three Patriarchs, who designate the Sefirot-properties %0a%3c Hesed-Qevura-Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Kuf and Reish indicate the evil side, as they form the impure %0a%3c side, called KaR (cold), which lacks warmth and life, for it draws its sustenance %0a%3c from Malchut when she turns from living water into ice. However, to create an %0a%3c opportunity to exist, these letters attach the Shin to themselves, thus creating the %0a%3c combination KeSHeR (tie, knot), which embodies strength and survival. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the Light of Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet of Bina, which she receives from Yesod %0a%3c de ZA, creates a new ending in Malchut, a new Kli-desire to receive the Light %0a%3c called "100 blessings" from ZA. And since Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet are called the %0a%3c Patriarchs, and the Light that passes to Malchut descends from them, the letter %0a%3c Shin that designates them is called "truth." %0a%3c %0a%3c By eliminating the sharp angle of the letter Dalet, the impure forces turn it %0a%3c into the letter Reish. By this, they convert the word ECHaD into ACHeR, thereby %0a%3c stealing Yesod of the pure Malchut, designated by Shin. Also, with the letter Shin %0a%3c they build the Yesod of the impure Malchut, which leads to a very strong clinging %0a%3c of impure forces to pure ones. This clinging is called KeSHeR, the reciprocal tie %0a%3c joining pure and impure forces, a knot that is not easily severed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid, we see that the reason for the letters wishing for the world %0a%3c to be created with them is that each of them believes that only its properties can %0a%3c correct the world. The letter Shin thinks that the Light of Hassadim will bring the %0a%3c souls to the goal of creation. However, the letters Kuf and Reish—KaR (cold)— do %0a%3c not desire this Light, for receiving the Light of Mercy for the sake of bestowal is %0a%3c pure, but receiving it for the sake of pleasure is impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TZADIK %0a%3c %0a%3c 26. Subsequently, the letter Tzadik appeared before the Creator and said: %0a%3c "Master of the world, You should create the world with me, for Tzadikim (the %0a%3c righteous) are marked by me. You, who is called a Tzadik (righteous one), are %0a%3c also recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. %0a%3c Therefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "Tzadik, you are truly righteous, but you must %0a%3c remain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world %0a%3c to be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse." The concealment %0a%3c of the letter Tzadik is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was %0a%3c then joined by the letter Yod from the Creator's Holy Name Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey %0a%3c (HaVaYaH), who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator %0a%3c and His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, %0a%3c thereby creating the letter Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the necessity of concealing the letter Tzadik, which makes it %0a%3c unsuitable for the creation of the world with it, is that when the Creator created %0a%3c Adam, i.e., ZA, He created him as two Part?u/im-objects— male and female, %0a%3c connected to each other back to back. This is why the letter Yod stands with its %0a%3c back to the back of the letter Nun, both facing opposite directions, just as the %0a%3c letter Tzadik is depicted: the face of Yod turned upwards, while the face of Nun %0a%3c is turned downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator also said to Tzadik: "In the future I will revoke the %0a%3c relationship of back-to back, and will join them face-to-face. In another place shall %0a%3c you so rise as such, but not at the beginning of creation. For in the beginning of %0a%3c creation, you must be connected back-to-back by the letters Nun and Yod, for this %0a%3c form indicates that the Light in you is concealed. Therefore, the world cannot %0a%3c be created with you." The letter Tzadik then left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzadik came to suggest that the world should be created with its properties, %0a%3c for when it saw that the Tav's request was turned down by the Creator due to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 155 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its heavy laws, and the letter Shin— due to the impure forces clinging to it— it %0a%3c thought that its properties could be suitable for the creation of the world. After %0a%3c all, it, too, contains the Creator's seal, and no impure forces cling to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why Tzadik said to the Creator that the righteous are sealed by %0a%3c its name as a mark of their union with Him, by circumcision and turning %0a%3c up of the place of contact (Zivug) with the Creator, which, thanks to these %0a%3c corrections, repels all the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator, called Bina, is also marked by Tzadik, for He is righteous %0a%3c like ZA, since the Upper Part of Bina of the world of Atzilut (Aba ve Ima— AVI) %0a%3c corresponds to the male and female parts, like ZA and Malchut. And AVI are %0a%3c forever joined so as to send down the Light of Mercy and thus sustain the %0a%3c existence of all that are below them. This is why Tzadik thought itself suitable %0a%3c for creating the world, for the world lives by the Light of Mercy, and can reach %0a%3c the goal with its help. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tzadik is called the Sefira Yesod of ZA. When Yesod joins with %0a%3c Malchut, it is defined as Tzadik (righteous), for the nine Sefirot of ZA are from Yod %0a%3c to Tzadik, and Kuf is the beginning of Malchut, which consists of four Sefirot— %0a%3c Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Malchut is joined with Yesod of ZA, Kuf is joined with Tzadik, and %0a%3c Yesod is called Tzadik (righteous). And to this the Creator replied to Tzadik that %0a%3c it is Tzadik in Yesod of ZA: "And you are Tzadik in Me, for AVI are forever joined %0a%3c so as to pour down the Light of Mercy and sustain the existence of the lower %0a%3c ones. And you are righteous, for Malchut is also connected to you, just as in the %0a%3c alphabet, Kuf follows Tzadik. Yet, in spite of all that, you do not merit for your %0a%3c properties to become the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod of ZA includes in itself Malchut in the form of the letter Kuf in the %0a%3c word TzadiK. And when Malchut is included in Yesod as Tzadik, it is designated %0a%3c by the letter Nun, for Nun is Gevura of ZA (Yod-Keter, Chaf-Hochma, Lamed-Bina, %0a%3c Mem-Hesed, Nun-Gevura). %0a%3c %0a%3c When ZA grows and becomes big, his Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet become %0a%3c Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat. Thus, Gevura becomes Bina. And when ZA becomes %0a%3c small once again, Bina, too, returns to being Gevura (Nun). This fall is designated %0a%3c by Nun's head looking down. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tzadik consists of the letters Nun and Yod connected back-to-back. %0a%3c The letter Nun designates Malchut with the properties of the Sefira Yesod included in %0a%3c her; Yod designates the actual Yesod of ZA. Their connection— back-to-back, facing %0a%3c out in opposite directions— indicates that impure forces cling to their backs. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 156 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c They conceal their backs from strangers since there is a flaw in their backs— the %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma). This flaw must be concealed %0a%3c so as to prevent the impure forces from clinging to their backs. Therefore, the %0a%3c letter Tzadik is unsuitable for the world to be created by its properties. Its very %0a%3c shape reveals an opportunity for the impure forces to cling to it; this is why Adam %0a%3c (created out of ZA and Malchut when they are joined as Tzadik) is also created %0a%3c consisting of two halves, male and female, joined at their backs. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if the letter Tzadik were to argue that in the big state, in the presence %0a%3c of Ohr Hochma, ZA and Malchut unite face-to-face, it would be told that such %0a%3c connection is impossible at their place, but only during their ascent to AVI. For %0a%3c if such a connection were possible in their own place, the impure forces would %0a%3c immediately cling to them. For this reason, the letter Tzadik is unworthy of %0a%3c becoming the basis of the universe. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER PEH %0a%3c %0a%3c 27. The letter Peh entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world with me, for the future liberation of the world is inscribed %0a%3c in me, as the word Pedut (liberation, redemption) begins with me. That is, %0a%3c liberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create %0a%3c the world with me." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered her: "Though you are fine, the word Peshah %0a%3c (transgression) begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent %0a%3c that strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding %0a%3c from others' eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the %0a%3c letter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it." And the Creator also said to the %0a%3c letter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, %0a%3c for within it is the property of Avon (crime, sin). And though Ayin tried to %0a%3c object, saying that its properties are contained in the word Anavah (humility), %0a%3c the Creator refused it nonetheless. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pedut (Liberation) begins with the letter Peh, meaning that the property %0a%3c of Peh is contained in future liberation. This is why the letter Peh claims that %0a%3c it is worthy of being the basis of the world. Indeed, both Galut (exile) and %0a%3c Ge'ula (redemption) depend on Malchut: when Malchut has no inner Light %0a%3c of Hochma, the people of Israel are exiled from the land of Israel. For in our %0a%3c world, the land of Israel corresponds to Malchut of the world of Atzilut, the %0a%3c spiritual land of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 157 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as in the spiritual world, ZA (Israel) distances from Malchut (the land %0a%3c of Israel), the people of Israel separate and leave their land in our world. And %0a%3c when the children of Israel correct their actions, they cause ZA (Israel) to fill his %0a%3c Malchut (the land of Israel) with Light, build her with his Light and unite with %0a%3c her face-to-face. As a result, the children of Israel of our world merit redemption %0a%3c and return to their land. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light from ZA, which builds and fills Malchut, descends from Sefirot %0a%3c Net^ah and Hod in ZA. Hochma of Malchut clothes in Net^ah and Bina of Malchut %0a%3c clothes in Hod. The letters Ayin and Peh are Netzah and Hod in ZA. This is why %0a%3c Peh, the Sefira Hod in ZA, claimed that it was suitable to be the basis of the world, %0a%3c for the Light of Hochma that brings redemption to the entire world stems from %0a%3c Peh to Malchut. Thus, if the world achieved its property, it would undoubtedly %0a%3c reach the end of correction— complete redemption. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Peh thought that it was more suitable to become the basis of %0a%3c the world than Ayin because although Ohr Hochma enters Netzah-Ayin and Hod- %0a%3c Peh, and is mainly present in Netzah-Ayin, redemption depends on Hod-Peh, %0a%3c nonetheless. That is because initially, Bina liberates Malchut from her restrictions %0a%3c and thereby redeems her. %0a%3c %0a%3c By receiving from Bina her properties of mercy, Malchut merits redemption. %0a%3c This is fulfilled in the following way: Bina transcends her own properties and %0a%3c joins with Malchut, as a result of which, upon receiving the Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c Malchut can now receive the Light of Hochma. The restrictions imposed on the %0a%3c reception of Light mostly affect the left side, i.e., Hod-Peh in ZA. And that is why %0a%3c the letter Peh thought that since the Light of Bina enters it, and not Netzah-Ayin, %0a%3c it is better suited to become the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all the individual corrections made during the 6,000 years of the %0a%3c world's existence until the end of correction are considered incomplete, for the %0a%3c Upper Light, which allows for the discovery and analysis of all the impure forces %0a%3c within oneself, is not present in its entirety. Therefore, the Light may not be %0a%3c received in the worlds of BYA, below Parsa, below the boundary that separates %0a%3c the world of At^ilut from the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa is Malchut that ascended to Bina in order to restrict the diffusion and %0a%3c reception of Light into those parts of her that are located below Bina. And as %0a%3c a consequence of Adam's attempt to nevertheless receive the Light under the %0a%3c Parsa, impurity slipped into Malchut, of which it is said that the serpent appeared %0a%3c before Chava (Eve) and brought impurity upon her (Talmud, Shahhat, 146). This %0a%3c impurity will only be corrected at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 158 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the absence of the Upper Light in the force capable of %0a%3c discerning good from evil in all of Malchut's thickness gives rise to a flaw called %0a%3c "tears"— two tears that fall into a vast sea from the two eyes of Hochma and Bina %0a%3c that are concealed from all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The two eyes are Hochma and Bina, and the tears signify the flaw in them %0a%3c from the presence of the impure force that appeared in them as a result of %0a%3c Adam's sin. This led to the ruin of the two Temples. These tears in Malchut's %0a%3c eyes will only dry at the end of correction, when death disappears from the %0a%3c world and all the Light shines in Hochma and Bina (item 56). %0a%3c %0a%3c So the letter Peh was told that although it brings the world Pedut (redemption) %0a%3c with its Light, and although all redemptions pass only through it, this Light is %0a%3c incomplete. All the individual corrections are imperfect, for they come and go, %0a%3c just as the two Temples. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the properties of Peshah (transgression) and Pedut (redemption) in the %0a%3c letter Peh are not sufficiently perfect and complete so as to withstand the sin of %0a%3c Adam, for in the absence of the full Light of Hochma, there is clinging of impure %0a%3c forces. Hence, the letter Peh is unworthy of being the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the property of Peshah (transgression) is concealed, the force of %0a%3c the serpent is present therein, deceiving people and leading them to their death. %0a%3c And it is impossible to kill it, just as a snake bites and immediately hides its head %0a%3c in itself (similar to the head of the letter Peh), which makes it impossible to kill %0a%3c it, for one may only kill the serpent within oneself by striking the "head." This %0a%3c is why the letter Peh is unsuitable for the creation of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER AYIN %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina of the world of Atzilut is called Ima Ilaa (Supernal Mother) and also Anavah %0a%3c (modesty, humility). (Here, the capital "A" designates the letter Ayin, not to be %0a%3c confused with Aleph). The Sefira Netzah of Zeir Anpin (designated by the letter %0a%3c Ayin) clothes into Malchut with all of its Light, and ascends to Bina, who adorns %0a%3c her with her own adornments: Bina clothes into Netzah of ZA. But since the %0a%3c letter Peh, signifying Peshah (transgression) is concealed in ~Netzah, the Creator %0a%3c refused to create the world with its properties, as it is written in item 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two words render the meaning of the word "transgression" in Hebrew: %0a%3c Peshah and Avon. However, "transgression" is mainly concentrated in the letter %0a%3c Peh, for Malchut of ZA connects into the Sefira Hod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 159 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Adam's sin, Klipot (shells, impure forces) cling to Malchut of %0a%3c ZA. But Netrah of ZA is a property of ZA himself, and impure forces cannot %0a%3c cling to it. Yet, as it is written in the Talmud (Baba Kama), even Netrah is subject %0a%3c to Klipot clinging to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This flaw— the ability of the impure forces to cling to Netrah of ZA— is called %0a%3c "transgression." However, the word Avon (not Peshah) indicates that Netrah is %0a%3c pure and direct, and that the transgression is caused by its connection with %0a%3c the Se/ira Hod. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason the Creator turns to the letters Peh and Ayin at the same time %0a%3c is that Netrah and Hod are like two body parts— two legs. This is why they both %0a%3c appeared before Him with their requests. However, The Zohar clarifies each of %0a%3c them (their properties) one at a time. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER SAMECH %0a%3c %0a%3c 28. The letter Samech appeared before the Creator and said: "Creator of the %0a%3c world, it would be good to create the world with my properties, for within %0a%3c me is Smicha (support) for the fallen, as it is written: 'The Creator supports %0a%3c (Somech) all who fall.'" The Creator replied: "That is why you are needed in %0a%3c your place; do not move from it. If you move from your place, contained in %0a%3c the word Somech, those who fall will lose your support, for they rely on you %0a%3c (your properties)." Having heard this, the letter Samech departed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Samech stands for Se/ira Tifferet in ZA, i.e., Bina in the body of %0a%3c ZA. Since Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina (KHB) were transformed into Hesed-Gevura- %0a%3c Tifferet (HGT) in ZA, they were emptied of the Light of Hochma, and were left %0a%3c with only the Light of Hassadim, thus changing their name from KHB to HGT. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we know, Bina consists of two parts: the Upper Part, called GAR: Gimel %0a%3c (three) Rishonot (first ones)— the first three Sefirot KHB, and the lower part, called %0a%3c ZAT: Zayin (seven) Tachtonot (lower ones)— the seven lower Sefirot from Hesed to %0a%3c Malchut. The Upper Part of Bina is called Aba ve Ima (AVI). Being filled with the %0a%3c Light of Mercy, Aba ve Ima exist in a state of perfection— without any desire to %0a%3c receive, but only to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI are designated by Samech (numerical value - 60), for they include the %0a%3c first three Sefirot KHB and three Sefirot of ZA, which, in view of the absence of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma in ZA, are not called KHB, but rather HGT. Therefore AVI consist %0a%3c of six Sefirot, each consisting of ten, totaling 60 = Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 160 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT of Bina receive the Light from Above and pass it on to ZA. This part %0a%3c of Bina has the property of ZA, rather than of Bina, as it needs to receive exactly %0a%3c what ZA needs, and then pass it to him. Since, unlike Bina, who does not wish %0a%3c to receive anything, ZAT of Bina need to receive Ohr Hochma for ZA, they feels %0a%3c a lack for it, and thus separate from Bina and an independently existing object- %0a%3c Partzuf forms out of her lower part. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Partzuf is called YESHSUT, and it is designated by the letter Mem %0a%3c (numerical value - 40), for it consists of four Sefirot—Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod %0a%3c of Partzuf AVI. Owing to its shape (properties), the block-letter Mem is called %0a%3c Mem Stumah (closed). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this separation of AVI into two parts occurs only when they have %0a%3c no Light of Hochma, but only the Light of Hassadim. Consequently, the Upper %0a%3c Part of Bina remains in its perfection, whereas the lower part feels a flaw in its %0a%3c state by not receiving Ohr Hochma. And since spiritual objects are separated by %0a%3c the differences in their properties, the sensation of imperfection separates the %0a%3c lower part of Bina from the Upper. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if those below improve their "intentions" (called "actions" in %0a%3c the spiritual), and ask ZA for help in correcting their actions, overcoming the %0a%3c egoism of impure desires, and acquiring spiritually pure, altruistic desires, ZA %0a%3c then turns to the superior YESHSUT, which turns to AVI. AVI then send their %0a%3c request even higher, receive the Light of Hochma and pass it to YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, YESHSUT and AVI unite into one Partzuf, for having received Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, YESHSUT becomes as perfect as AVI are perfect being filled with Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma down to ZA, who then passes %0a%3c it to Malchut. The Light that Malchut receives from ZA is referred to as 100 %0a%3c blessings, for Samech = 60 joins with Mem = 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when man sins in his intentions (desires, actions), he does not %0a%3c turn to Malchut with a request for help, causing the Light of Hochma to disappear %0a%3c from ZA, and ZA returns from Gadlut (big state) back to Katnut (small state). %0a%3c (When ZA contains the Light of Hochma, he is called "big"; and when he is filled %0a%3c with only the Light of Hassadim, he is called "small"). And the united Partzuf %0a%3c Bina is once more divided into AVI and YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this small state (Katnut), ZA and Malchut are in danger of impure forces %0a%3c (Klipot) clinging to them. To make certain this does not happen, for then they %0a%3c may fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa into the worlds BYA, AVI send %0a%3c them the property of Samech (the Light of Mercy). And although it is only the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim without the Light of Wisdom (Light of Hochma), it provides %0a%3c ZA and Malchut with the sensation of perfection in acts of bestowal, and thus %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 161 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c impure forces can no longer cling to them, for the sole intention of the impure %0a%3c forces is to receive the Light of Wisdom from a pure Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is why the Light that fills ZA in Katnut is called Samech, which %0a%3c testifies to its action: Samech "supports" ZA and Malchut so that they wouldn't %0a%3c fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the letter Samech thought that if the world were created with %0a%3c its properties, it would be able to reach the goal of creation and merge with %0a%3c the Creator. Its Light could shine in ZA and Malchut even in their small state, %0a%3c and the Klipa (impure force) would not attempt to snatch the Light from them. %0a%3c On the contrary, the impure, egoistic forces would flee from its Light. Samech %0a%3c believed that if the world were to be created with its properties, it would be able %0a%3c to protect all creatures, even when their actions were corrupted, for even in such %0a%3c a state, the impure force would not be able to harm them. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator said to Samech that precisely because its role is to support %0a%3c those who fall and to protect the lower ones in times of their spiritual descent, %0a%3c it must stay in its place and not move from it. For if the world were created by %0a%3c it, its power would always prevail over all, ridding ZA and Malchut of the chance %0a%3c to grow out of their small state. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if ZA and Malchut don't stimulate the lower ones (people) to raise %0a%3c MAN— request for help in achieving Gadlut, the Upper Light will not be able %0a%3c to descend to bring the creatures to the end of correction and redemption. %0a%3c Therefore, the letter Samech must support the lower ones until they merit more. %0a%3c But when they do merit, they will be able to receive the great Light called " 100 %0a%3c blessings" into their entire Partzuf. So the Creator refused to create the world %0a%3c with the letter Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Because the lower ones need Samech only in their Katnut, in the absence %0a%3c of the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), ZON need you and you can help them. %0a%3c However, they need you only in their Katnut. But you do not help to bring them %0a%3c to perfection, and so you cannot be the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER NUN %0a%3c %0a%3c 29. The letter Nun entered and said to the Creator: "It would be good for You %0a%3c to create the world with me, for Norah Tehilot (great praises) is written with %0a%3c me, as well as 'Praising of the righteous.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator replied: "Return to your place, for you are the reason that %0a%3c the letter Samech returned to its place. And rely on it for support. For the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 162 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c letter Nun exists in the word Nefilah (fall), which must be corrected by the %0a%3c letter Samech. This is the reason why it needed to return to its place— so as to %0a%3c strengthen the lower ones." The letter Nun left Him at once. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Nun saw that the Creator sent the letter Samech away (as its properties %0a%3c are only used in the state of Katnut, that is, only to support those who had fallen %0a%3c from the Gadlut), it thought that it was worthy of being the basis of the world. %0a%3c This is because not only does Nun have all the advantages of Samech, but it can %0a%3c also use Ohr Hochma, the Light of Gadlut. Thus, the reason for the Creator's %0a%3c refusal to Samech does not apply to Nun. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Gevura in ZA is called Nun, for it is entirely mitigated by Bina's %0a%3c property of mercy, called Nun = 50 gates of Bina. It is this property of Gevura that %0a%3c gives ZA the name Norah Tehilot (great praises). lma-Bina is called Tehilah (praise), %0a%3c and since Gevura descends from Bina, it is referred to as Norah Tehilot, while Nun %0a%3c is used in the Sefira Yesod, in the Gadlut of ZA during his Zivug with Nukva. Like %0a%3c Ima, this is whence Nukva receives the name Tehilah, while ZA becomes one in %0a%3c both Tehilot— Ima and Nulcva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the letter Nun said that, being in Gevura, the left line of ZA, it %0a%3c attracts the Light of Mercy emanated by Samech (Bina, Ima), which is also called %0a%3c the "Upper Tehilah," as a result of which ZA acquires its properties and the name %0a%3c Norah Tehilot to match them. This is why Nun has all the properties of Samech: the %0a%3c Light of Mercy that bestows perfection and repels the impure forces-desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Nun added: "However, I have an additional advantage in that I am %0a%3c used during the big state of ZA in his Yesod, in the letter Tzadik, of which I am %0a%3c the left element." This Nun in the letter Tzadik is that same Nun that is defined as %0a%3c Norah Tehilot (praises of the righteous), for even when ZA achieves Gadlut during %0a%3c the ascent of ZON to AVI, Nun also acts in Yesod of ZA, connecting Nukva back- %0a%3c to-back with ZA, so that ZA receives the Light of Mercy from AVI (Samech). %0a%3c %0a%3c And so Nun is called "praises of the righteous," for Yod (righteous one, the %0a%3c basis of the world) mounts it. Nun is called "great praises," for it attracts the %0a%3c Light of Wisdom to Malchut in the state of Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, we find that Malchut receives all her beauty from Nun, which is %0a%3c located in Yesod of ZA. This is why the letter Nun claimed that it merits for the %0a%3c world to be created with its properties, for its luminescence adds to the Light of %0a%3c Wisdom that unites and revives ZON, and does not merely support them, like %0a%3c the letter Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the Creator answered it: "You are wrong in thinking that you merit %0a%3c leading the world to complete correction by your properties, without the clinging %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 163 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of impure forces, for even your properties need to be supported by the letter %0a%3c Samech. Indeed, this is precisely why you are connected back-to-back with the %0a%3c letter Yod, and the Light of Samech guards you against the clinging of the impure %0a%3c forces onto you. And that is why your properties, which rely upon the strength %0a%3c of Samech, are merely ones of support. Hence, you are unworthy of becoming %0a%3c the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS MEM AND LAMED %0a%3c %0a%3c 30. The letter Mem entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a%3c for You to create the world by me, for MelecH (King) is called by me." The %0a%3c Creator replied: "That is so, but I shall not create the world by you, for the %0a%3c world needs a King. Return to your place. Also, I shall not create the world %0a%3c with the letters Lamed and Chaf that form the word MeLeCH (King), as the %0a%3c world cannot exist without a King." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Mem is the Se/ira Hesed in ZA, which receives the Light from its %0a%3c corresponding Se/ira Hesed in Bina. When, in addition to the Light of Mercy %0a%3c in his small state, ZA receives the Light of Wisdom and becomes big, his Sefirot %0a%3c HGT turn into Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat (HBD). In other words, Hesed in ZA %0a%3c ascends and becomes Hochma, thereby revealing a new Light, the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, the Light of the Creator's face. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the letter Mem claimed that it was suitable for the world to be %0a%3c created by it, for it reveals the Creator's Light to the world, thereby eliminat- %0a%3c ing any risk of impure forces clinging to it, and so the world is guaranteed %0a%3c complete correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered that it is forbidden to reveal this Light to the %0a%3c world, for the world needs for this great Light to first clothe itself in the three %0a%3c letters of the word MeLeCH. In other words, the great Light may be revealed in %0a%3c the world only if Mem joins with the letters Lamed and Chaf. So the Creator said, %0a%3c "Go and join with them." %0a%3c %0a%3c Mem in the word Meleck is Hesed. Lamed is Bina, which passes the Light %0a%3c to ZA. The letter Chaf is Malchut, Nukva of ZA, for there cannot be a Meleck %0a%3c (King) without Malchut (Kingdom). Also, all of the Light becomes revealed only %0a%3c thanks to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this case, Malchut shines from ZA in three places: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) Malckut becomes a Kisseh (throne) for a King (ZA). A Kisseh derives from %0a%3c Kissui (cover, concealment), so it is designated by the bent letter Chaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 164 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) Malchut clothes ZA. Because the great Light is revealed only to Israel, %0a%3c Malchut clothes ZA, and when her kingdom is revealed, ZA frees %0a%3c himself from her garment and throws it over all the nations of the %0a%3c world, idolaters, and the Light of his face pours upon Israel. And all %0a%3c the righteous then point their finger at the Creator and say: "This is %0a%3c the Creator, to whom I aspired!" This diffusion of Light is designated %0a%3c by the letter Chaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) Malchut becomes a crown on the head of ZA. And this is the property %0a%3c of the letter Chaf, of Keter (crown of ZA). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER CHAF %0a%3c %0a%3c 31. At this time the letter Chaf descended from the Kisseh - the Creator's %0a%3c throne, and stood before the Creator. It trembled and said to Him: "Creator %0a%3c of the world, with my properties I merit to become the basis of the world, for I %0a%3c am Kavod - Your Glory." When the letter Chaf descended from the Creator's %0a%3c throne, all the worlds trembled, and the throne itself, verging on collapse. %0a%3c The Creator then answered: "Chaf, what are you doing here? I will not create %0a%3c the world by you. Return to your place, for you exist in the word Kelayah %0a%3c (destruction) and in the word Kalah (bride)." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's throne is the world of Beria. The appearance of the letter %0a%3c Mem before the Creator led to the letter Chaf falling from His throne. As a %0a%3c result, Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria trembled, as well as all the lower %0a%3c worlds with all their inhabitants. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the arguments that the letters raised in their wish for the world to be %0a%3c created with each of them is like raising MAN— a request for precise measure of %0a%3c help from Above in the form of Upper Light (called MAD), corresponding to %0a%3c that particular letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c If so, ZON will rule the world, and this ruling is effected by the very Light %0a%3c descending from ZON in the exact quantity of MAD that each letter evoked %0a%3c and caused, for the MAD precisely corresponds to the MAN in both quantity %0a%3c and quality, whereas MAN is the actual property of the letter. Hence, each letter %0a%3c argues that it can draw the kind of Light from Above that will surely bring all %0a%3c creatures to the goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Creator's answers to each of the twenty-two letters of ZON de %0a%3c Atzilut constitute the descending MAD (the Upper Light, strength, help) that %0a%3c precisely corresponds to the MAN raised by that particular letter. And when the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 165 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Upper Light that descends from a particular letter begins to rule the world, this %0a%3c signifies the Creator's reply to that letter. Since the impure forces cling to one of %0a%3c the letter's properties, as the Creator created two precisely balanced, opposing %0a%3c systems of pure and impure forces, this reveals the letter's inability to rule the %0a%3c world. And thus, the Creator dismissed each letter's individual claim to build %0a%3c the world by its property in order to bring it to the goal of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Herein lies the Creator's "game" with each of the twenty-two letters, giving %0a%3c each the opportunity to reveal its properties, power and forces, until it becomes %0a%3c clear from their aspirations and analysis, which of them truly merits the world %0a%3c being governed by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we see that when the letter Mem began to reveal its great Light in %0a%3c the world, in doing so, it caused the fall of the Kisse (throne). This is so because %0a%3c the Kisse has two properties: (i) it covers and conceals the Creator, where the %0a%3c word Kisse derives from the word Kissui; (ii) it reveals the Creator's greatness in %0a%3c the worlds with the help of the three letters MeLeCH. Then, Malchut that became %0a%3c a Kissui, the Creator's cover, ascends and turns to Chaf— the Creator's own gar- %0a%3c ments—thus revealing the King (Creator), and it becomes a crown on His head. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as the letter Mem, which was not clothed in Chaf, began to reveal %0a%3c the Light of the Creator's face, the letter Chaf fell from the Kisse (the throne of %0a%3c His Glory), stopped concealing Him, and stated that from now on only the %0a%3c Creator's revealed glory would rule over it, without any kind of concealment, as %0a%3c desired by Mem. %0a%3c %0a%3c Owing to Chaf s fall from the throne, two hundred thousand worlds that origi- %0a%3c nate from Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria, as well as the worlds below them, %0a%3c shook and trembled on the verge of collapse. For the entire connection between %0a%3c the lower degree or Partzuf and the one above it lies in the fact that Malchut of the %0a%3c Upper Degree becomes Keter of the lower. And the property of the letter Chaf con- %0a%3c sists in clothing Malchut of an Upper spiritual object in Keter of a lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three distinctive features to the throne: (i) six steps leading to the %0a%3c throne, six Sefirot-Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod of the lower one; (ii) four %0a%3c legs of the throne, the Light in Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina-Daat of the lower one; %0a%3c (iii) Malchut of the Upper One that descends to the lower one, clothes into it, %0a%3c and all the Light from the Upper One is passed through her to the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, when Chaf fell from the throne of the Creator's glory, the connection %0a%3c between the world of Atzilut and the throne (world of Beria) was severed. This %0a%3c is so because Chaf (Malchut of the world of Atzilut) that clothes in Sefirot Keter- %0a%3c Hochma-Bina-Daat of the world of Beria pours all the Light onto the world of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 166 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria, called the throne of His glory. But when Chaf fell from the throne, the %0a%3c connection between the world of Atzilut and the world of Beria was severed, %0a%3c Chaf trembled, for it lost the power to bestow upon the world of Beria, and two %0a%3c hundred thousand worlds (Hochma and Bina out of Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina- %0a%3c Daat of the world of Beria) trembled in fear of collapsing, for they lost all of their %0a%3c life-force, which they receive from the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, in the world of Atzilut, Bina of the world of Atzilut, the Creator, is %0a%3c connected with ZON. This is because Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut consists %0a%3c of ten Sefirot, and her last Sefira, Malchut, clothes in ZA of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c with the property of the letter Chaf. Malchut of the Sefira Bina, which clothes in %0a%3c ZA, is the letter Chaf. And this letter Chaf is the Creator's throne in ZA. For the %0a%3c Creator is Bina, Sefira above ZA. And ZA becomes a throne for Bina. And during %0a%3c the fall, the connection between Bina and ZA is severed, since Chaf is Malchut of %0a%3c Bina; it clothes into ZA and passes all the Light to him. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it therefore trembled (lost its ability to bestow upon ZA), and so did %0a%3c two hundred thousand worlds, which are the Light for ZA, called Hochma and %0a%3c Bina or KHBD— the four legs of the throne— for all the Light departed from %0a%3c them. And the worlds trembled in fear of collapsing, that is, Sefirot Hesed-Gevura- %0a%3c Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod in ZA that include all the worlds below them, for all the %0a%3c Light of Bina departed thence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator told the letter Chaf that because it fell from the throne of His %0a%3c glory, the first three Sefirot of ZA trembled, and all the other worlds are on the %0a%3c verge of total collapse and destruction without any hope of restoration; hence, %0a%3c Chaf must return to its place in the throne of glory. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaf's return to its place in the Creator's throne takes place just as He %0a%3c refuses to create the world with the letter Mem, for the world needs a King. That %0a%3c is, the trembling of the letter Chaf as it fell from the Creator's throne, which %0a%3c in turn, made the worlds tremble in fear of possible collapse, and the Creator's %0a%3c answer to the letter Mem transpire simultaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER YOD %0a%3c %0a%3c 32. The letter Yod entered and said: "Maker of the world! It would be good %0a%3c to create the world by me, for Your Holy name begins with me." The Creator %0a%3c replied: "It is sufficient that you are inscribed in My Name, in Me, and all of %0a%3c your aspirations are to Me, and you should not be uprooted from it all." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 167 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Yod is the first letter of the Creator's name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a%3c Hey), the beginning of the Creator's revelation to creatures, the first degree %0a%3c of the Upper Light, the letter Yod argued for the world to be created with %0a%3c its properties, for the world would then be absolutely guaranteed complete %0a%3c correction. However, the Creator objects to it. As was already stated, the letters' %0a%3c questions and the Creator's answers signify the Creator playing with each letter, %0a%3c where the letters' questions are their MAN, and the Creator's answers are MAD %0a%3c in the form of the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, by telling Yod, "It is sufficient," the Creator thus explained the creation of %0a%3c restriction— that the Light is only allowed to descend to its level, but no further. %0a%3c And this restriction is fixed in the Creator's name Shadday (Shin-Dalet-Yod). After %0a%3c Yod began to spread with the great Light, the Creator stopped it, forbidding it %0a%3c to spread to the letter Tav, but only to Shin (as was said above, in item 25). He %0a%3c said to it: "Enough, and do not spread further. Otherwise you will not be able %0a%3c to remain forever in My Name HaVaYaH." %0a%3c %0a%3c As the sages said: "My Name is not pronounced as it is written. For it is %0a%3c written HaVaYaH, but pronounced Adonay" (Talmud, Pesahim, 50). Indeed, %0a%3c the name HaVaYaH is not subject to change, as it is written: "For I, the Lord %0a%3c (HaVaYaH), do not change" (Malachi, 3:6). For corruption and its correction %0a%3c emerge in the days of the world's existence, meaning that constant changes are %0a%3c coming. Therefore, until the end of correction, the Creator is called Adonay, for %0a%3c this name is subject to change, and not HaVaYaH, which can never be altered. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, in the future, after the end of correction, HaVaYaH will be pronounced %0a%3c as it is written. Therefore, the Creator said, "If I see some fault or evil in you, %0a%3c by this you will be removed from My Name, for My Name, HaVaYaH, may not %0a%3c contain anything flawed or corrected— neither corruption nor correction. And %0a%3c this is why the world cannot be created by your properties." There are three %0a%3c degrees in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH: in the Sefira Hochma of ZA, in %0a%3c Hochma of AVI, and in Hochma of Arich Anpin, called "concealed wisdom." %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH begins with a dot, which then turns into Yod. Subsequently, Yod %0a%3c (Ohr Hochma) spreads to the sides and downward and turns into the letter Dalet, %0a%3c which consists of a horizontal roof-like line that indicates the property of Bina- %0a%3c Ima (mercy, Hassadim, width). When Ohr Hassadim stops spreading in width, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma begins to spread downward in the form of a vertical line. This is the %0a%3c leg of the letter Dalet, the property of Hochma-Aba. %0a%3c %0a%3c The common property of AVI is designated by the letter Dalet. AVI beget %0a%3c ZA, designated by the letter Vav inside the Dalet, and eventually forms the shape %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 168 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the letter Hey. Thus, the request of ZA (Vav) to receive from AVI compels %0a%3c them to unite their properties of Hochma (vertical line) and Hassadim (horizontal %0a%3c line), with the help of the letter Yod. Consequently, AVI receive the Light from %0a%3c Yod and pass it on to ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The screen with the desires of Malchut is called "a point," since the collision %0a%3c between the screen and the coming Light yields Returning Light. And since the %0a%3c received Light always consists of ten Lights, the screen is called "ten points." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod designates the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf Keter, from the Light %0a%3c of Hochma downwards, while Vav signifies the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma. However, there is no sign in HaVaYaH that indicates the diffusion of %0a%3c Light in Keter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Entrance or exit of the letter Yod in a word signifies either presence or %0a%3c absence of the Light of Hochma. There are four kinds of correction: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The First Ibur— conception of the small state of ZON. This is an %0a%3c absolutely passive spiritual state, where the letter Yod enters the %0a%3c word Ohr (Light) and transforms it into Avir (air), becoming the %0a%3c VAK of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The letter Yod exits the word Avir, which converts it back to Ohr: the %0a%3c Light of Hochma enters VAK of Partzuf; %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The Second Ibur— conception of the Gadlut state of ZON: AHP of %0a%3c Bina ascend from ZON to Bina, and GE de ZON ascend with them, %0a%3c for they were together in the Katnut state, defined as conception of %0a%3c GE de ZON; %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. The diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TET %0a%3c %0a%3c 33. The letter Tet entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world with me, for it is by me that You are called Tov (Good)." %0a%3c The Creator replied: "I will not create the world by you, for your goodness is %0a%3c concealed within you and is invisible. Therefore, it cannot take any part in %0a%3c the world that I wish to create, and will only be revealed in the world to come. %0a%3c And since your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the palace will %0a%3c sink into the ground, for the letter Chet is opposite from you, and when you %0a%3c join together, the word CHeT (sin) will be formed. This is why these two %0a%3c letters are not recorded in the names of the holy tribes." The letter Chet %0a%3c immediately moved aside. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 169 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tet, whose numeric value of nine, is the inner property of the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod in ZA, while the outer property of Yesod in ZA is the letter Tzadik, %0a%3c whose numeric value of ninety, and it joins with Nukva de ZA, forming the %0a%3c notion of Tzadik (righteous one). Besides being the inner property of Yesod in %0a%3c ZA, Tet is also the ninth letter among the letters of Bina in ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Tet is called Tov (good). And since Tov is called Tzadik, for it is the %0a%3c inner Light of Yesod, called Tzadik, to whom no impure forces could cling, Tet %0a%3c calls on the above to justify its claim to become the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the Talmud (Hagiga, 12), the sages wrote: "In the Light by which the %0a%3c Creator created the world, Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. %0a%3c But the Creator saw that the deeds of the generations of the Flood and the %0a%3c builders of the Tower of Babel are detrimental, and concealed that Light for the %0a%3c righteous in the future." Because the Creator saw that their actions will bring %0a%3c the threat of the clinging of the impure forces, He concealed this Light, Thus, %0a%3c the Light descended secretly from the Supernal Righteous (AVI) to the righteous %0a%3c one (Yesod in ZA), the letter Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c And so the Creator told Tet that because He must conceal it from the sinners %0a%3c and only the righteous will be worthy of it in the world to come, it cannot %0a%3c partake in the creation and correction of the world, for the world is ZON, and %0a%3c the letter Tet is constantly in danger of being clung to by impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since this Light shines only secretly inside Yesod of ZA, and not %0a%3c openly, Nukva will not be able to receive this Light directly, but only through %0a%3c its concealment in her. Therefore, the gates of Nukva sink into her Sefira Yesod, %0a%3c which safeguards them against the clinging of the impure forces, and they are %0a%3c confident that the impure forces will not be able to rule over her gates. For even %0a%3c at the time of the ruin of the Temple, the impure forces could not rule over the %0a%3c gates of the Temple, and sank into the ground, that is, the ground consumed %0a%3c them. "But because you are in need of such protection, I cannot create the world %0a%3c with you," the Creator answered Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two pipes (channels) in Yesod de ZA in the world of Atzilut: the %0a%3c right one serves for the birth of the souls, and the left one for throwing away %0a%3c waste to the impure forces. The letter Chet is Hod, whose property is Malchut %0a%3c in ZA, the left pipe in Yesod of ZA, for the properties of the letter Chet are the %0a%3c properties of Ku/ included in Yesod, whereas Ku/ emanates Ner Dakik (tiny Light) %0a%3c to the impure forces, from which they receive the strength to be similar to an %0a%3c image of a pure man, as a monkey compared to a man, for the Creator created %0a%3c purity parallel to impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 170 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These two pipes are located very close to each other, separated only by a thin %0a%3c partition, called "a garlic husk." Consequently, the left pipe has the strength to %0a%3c rule over the right one, thereby forming CHeT (numerical value 8 + 9 = 17). %0a%3c %0a%3c The numerical value of CHeT (17) equals that of the word TOV (9 + 6 + %0a%3c 2 = 17), which means that the impure force opposes the pure one. And if the %0a%3c right pipe (the letter Tet) prevails, the word CHeT (sin) will turn into TOV %0a%3c (good, goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the left pipe (CHeT) has the strength to rule over the right one (Tet), %0a%3c the impure forces can suck the Upper Light for themselves. This would give %0a%3c power to the sinners of the world. This is why neither diet nor Tet are present in %0a%3c the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, to show that they (the tribes) are above %0a%3c the letter Chet, the root of all the opposing impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c When all the letters merited receiving a blessing through the letter Bet, they %0a%3c lined up in their alphabetical order, in which the letters Tet and Reish joined. %0a%3c The letter Tet ascended, but did not take its place until the Creator asked her: %0a%3c "Tet, why did you ascend, but do not take your place?" It replied: "You created %0a%3c me to begin the words Tov (goodness) and Torah, as it is written: 'And the %0a%3c Creator saw that the Light was good.' How then can I join and stand beside the %0a%3c letter Reish, when it begins the word Rah (evil)?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "Return to your place, for it is precisely you that %0a%3c needs the letter Reish. For man, whom I intend to create, combines all those %0a%3c properties— you as the right property, and Reish as the left." After that, both Tet %0a%3c and Reish returned to their places. %0a%3c %0a%3c Three lines emerge in ZA of the world of Atzilut. However, they emerge from %0a%3c their source, Bina. (As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascends to Bina, %0a%3c which leads to Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut falling into a lower Partzuf, into ZA.) Bina %0a%3c is called Eloh-im (Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem), and as a result of second restriction, %0a%3c her part Ale£>h-Lame%3ci-He)i (the ELEH of the word Eloh-im, AHP) fell into a lower %0a%3c Partzuf, to ZA. Only the letters Yod-Mem (the IM of Eloh-im) remained in Bina. %0a%3c This means that only half, ( VAK, GE) remained in her from the previous level of %0a%3c GAR. Whatever is left is designated by a sign called Holam—Vav with a dot above %0a%3c it, as this is the right line, Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, in the big state, the letters Ale£>h-Lame%3ciHe;y (ELEH) returned to Bina %0a%3c and joined with Yod-Mem (IM). Subsequently, the level of GAR returned, yet the %0a%3c Light of Hochma in Bina was incomplete, for the Light of Hassadim disappeared %0a%3c and the Light of Hochma cannot shine without the Light of Hassadim. The %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 171 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c returned letters A-L-H are Shuruk—Vav with a dot inside it, because, due to the %0a%3c restrictions in it, it constitutes the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c These restrictions are effective until ZON, upon ascending to Bina, begin to %0a%3c receive the Light, and the middle line emerges and reduces GAR of Hochma in %0a%3c the left line. As a result, the right line joins with the left: Ohr Hochma shines in %0a%3c the Ohr Hassadim. This middle line is called Hirik—Vav with a dot under it, or %0a%3c the screen of Hirik, for the Light enters the Partzuf because of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Bina regained GAR with ZA's help, ZA, now that he had acquired %0a%3c the three lines, begins to receive this Light from Bina, too. Yod-Mem (IM), Tet %0a%3c and Holam constitute the right line, Aleph-Lamed-Hey (ELEH), Reish and Shuruk %0a%3c constitute the left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now let us translate this into the language of Sefirot. When Bina returned %0a%3c once more to the state of Gadlut, ELEH returned to IM, the left line merged %0a%3c with the right, and this drove Tet (right line, Hassadim) away from Reish (left %0a%3c line). This is because being opposite to each other, they cannot stand side by %0a%3c side until the Creator (ZA, middle line) reduces the GAR of both the left and %0a%3c right lines by the force of His screen, which is expressed by the words: "And the %0a%3c Creator commanded it to return to its place." %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR de Hochma is called Man 'ula— the lock that prevents the Light from %0a%3c entering a Partzuf, and its diminution is called Miftacha— the key that opens a %0a%3c passage for the Light, VAK of Hochma, to spread in the left line into a Partzuf. %0a%3c Then, Tet, the right line, receives Ohr Hochma from the left, joins with Reish, %0a%3c receiving from it the Light of Hochma. Otherwise it would have remained in %0a%3c VAK. Adam, too, is created from the union of these two lines. %0a%3c %0a%3c But why was the letter Tet reluctant to join with the letter Reish, and had %0a%3c to be forced to do so by the Creator? In the spiritual world, a root rules over %0a%3c all its branches, and the branches submit to its rule. Therefore, Tet did not %0a%3c wish to join with Reish, as it was then bound to become a branch and submit %0a%3c to its root, Reish. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator wanted Tet to receive the Light of Hochma from Reish %0a%3c so that this union would enable man to receive the Light of GAR. Thus, when %0a%3c ELEH return to Bina, He made it so Bina's restrictions would be weakened so as %0a%3c to allow the Reish to join with the Tet and receive the Light of Hassadim from it. It %0a%3c follows that Tet becomes the root with regard to Reish, for without its Hassadim, %0a%3c Reish would be unable to shine, due to the restrictions placed on its Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 172 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER ZAYIN %0a%3c %0a%3c 34. The letter Zayin entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world by me, as Shabbat is preserved with me, for it is written: %0a%3c 'Remember (Zachor) the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it.'" The Creator %0a%3c replied: "I will not create the world by you, for within you is a force of war, as %0a%3c sabers and swords, called Klei Zayin (weaponry), are made by you. And you %0a%3c are like the letter Nun, with which the world was not created, for within it is %0a%3c Nefilah (fall)" (item 29). Having heard that, the letter Zayin left Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Zayin is depicted as a combination of Vav and Yod, as a head over %0a%3c it, which signifies the big state and the great Light in Malchut, ZA's wife, for %0a%3c Malchut includes herself into her husband, ZA (designated by Vav), and becomes %0a%3c a crown (Yod) on his head. Together, these two letters, Vav with Yod standing %0a%3c above it, form the letter Zayin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written: "Remember the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it holy." %0a%3c As a result of Shabbat's elevation, that is, Nukva's ascent to the head of ZA, when %0a%3c she becomes his crown, she includes herself in the word Zachor (remember) and %0a%3c receives the name Nukva Kedoshah (holy Nukva). This is why the letter Zayin %0a%3c claimed that since this Light is so great and holy that it brings absolute rest on %0a%3c this day, for purity is completely separated from impurity in this state called %0a%3c Shabbat, it is worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin is the Sefira Net^ah in ZA. When Nukva is included in Net^ah and %0a%3c merges with its properties, she gains the strength to ascend along with ZA to %0a%3c AVI. There she becomes a crown on his head, by which he is adorned, which %0a%3c signifies the day of Shabbat. However, since this correction occurs solely as a %0a%3c result of her inclusion in the male essence and their ascent to AVI, and not in %0a%3c her regular place, where she normally abides with ZA, Nukva cannot be corrected %0a%3c completely during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that when Nukva returns to her place on weekdays, her %0a%3c connection with the letter Za^in is defined as a Kli Zayin (weapon), and all the wars %0a%3c with the impure forces emerge from her, like the weekdays that prepare Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c For every man must defeat the impure force within him on the weekdays, %0a%3c and thus merit the King's daughter— Shabbat. However, during the 6,000 years, %0a%3c the Light of Shabbat is insufficient for the neutralization of the impure forces, %0a%3c for weekdays return and surround the Shabbat. This continues until the end %0a%3c of correction, when there will be only Shabbat as the day of absolute perfection %0a%3c for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 173 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is also why the Creator replied to Zayin: "I will not create the world with %0a%3c you, for when you are in your place, your Light is not yet perfect. Only after you %0a%3c defeat the impure forces in war will man be able to attain you." And the shape of %0a%3c the letter Vav (ZA) resembles a spear, ready to strike and pierce through the impure %0a%3c forces. For Gevurot (courage) signifies the left line of Bina's male part (Nun). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS VAV AND HEY %0a%3c %0a%3c 35. The letter Vav entered and said: "It would be good to create the world %0a%3c with me, for I am a letter from Your Name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey)." %0a%3c The Creator replied: "Vav, both you and the letter Hey should just be glad to %0a%3c be contained within My Name. This is why I will not create the world with %0a%3c your properties." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the letter Yod expressed a similar request, Vav thought that Yod %0a%3c had been turned down because of its excessive size (spiritual force). This is why %0a%3c Vav claimed that it would be good to create the world with its properties, i.e., %0a%3c according to the letters Vav-Hey in the name HaVaYaH, with the Light of the %0a%3c Supernal Bina (Ima) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator responded with the same answer he had given to the letter %0a%3c Yod— that He restricted it by saying to DaY (Dalet-Yod): "Stop at the letter Shin %0a%3c and spread no more, so that the impure forces would not cling to you." Hence, %0a%3c the letters Vav and Hey are not suitable for the world to be created with their %0a%3c properties, for even they need protection against the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Tifferet is designated by the big letter Vav (Vav with a head), for it has %0a%3c all six (Vav) Sefirot: Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. Yesod is the Sefira that is %0a%3c responsible for passing the Light from ZA to Malchut. This is why it has the same %0a%3c Light as in Malchut— NHY without HGT, and this is also why Yesod is called the %0a%3c small Vav (Vav without a head). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS DALET AND QIMEL %0a%3c %0a%3c 36. The letters Dalet and Qimel appeared before the Creator. However, the %0a%3c Creator told them right away: "It is enough that you are both together, so that %0a%3c as long as the poor exist on earth, there is someone to treat them with mercy %0a%3c (LiQmol Hesed)." The letter Dalet derives from Dalut (poverty), while Qimel %0a%3c renders mercy to it (Qomelet Hassadim). "Therefore, you cannot part, and it %0a%3c is enough for you to aid one another in this way." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 174 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already stated (item 24) that although Dalet receives the Light from %0a%3c Gzme! and its sharp right angle protrudes from the Light of Hassadim, the impure %0a%3c forces are nonetheless strong enough to cling to it, separate it and make the %0a%3c sharp angle smooth, thus transforming it into the letter Reish. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the letter Dalet requires special protection so as not to be %0a%3c corrupted and to be able to continue being fulfilled by Gimel so as to keep the %0a%3c needy ones (Dalut) in the world from disappearing. Thus, it is sufficient for %0a%3c these two forces to sustain and complement one another, to fulfill one another %0a%3c in reciprocal union so as to prevent the impure forces from ruling. And this %0a%3c role is enough from them. This is why the Creator did not want to create the %0a%3c world with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER BET %0a%3c %0a%3c 37. The letter Bet entered and said to the Creator: "Maker of the world, it %0a%3c would be good to create the world by me, as by me You are blessed Above and %0a%3c below. For Bet is Berachah (blessing)." The Creator replied to Bet: "Of course, %0a%3c I will create the world by you, and you shall be the basis of the world!" %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Bet is the property of Hochma (wisdom), or rather Hesed in Hochma, %0a%3c a point in a palace, for Ohr Hassadim is a palace for Ohr Hochma and is called %0a%3c Berachah (blessing). Passing through all of the worlds from the Creator down to %0a%3c the lowest degree of the lowest world, this Light does not diminish in any way. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rather, just as this Light is at the Highest Degree that receives it from the %0a%3c World of Infinity, it is just as great, magnificent, and mighty in the world of %0a%3c Atzilut, and likewise all the way down to the world of Assiya. And it does not get %0a%3c coarser or weaker as it passes through all the screens from Above downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the letter Bet vied for the world to be created with its properties, %0a%3c as the Light of blessing is the same both Above and below; no screen can weaken %0a%3c it and no coarse desires can harm it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is also why the property of mercy (Hassadim) is most suitable for the %0a%3c creation of the world, for no impure forces can cling to it. This is because the %0a%3c impure forces can only cling to a place where there is a deficiency. And since %0a%3c there is no deficiency of any kind in the property of mercy, there can never be %0a%3c any contact between Bet and the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator agreed with Bet that its property is perfect and suitable for %0a%3c the creation of the universe by Him. As it is said: "Olam (world) Hesed (mercy) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 175 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YiBaneh (will be built)," where YiBaneh means Boneh (building) and HaVana %0a%3c (understanding). (In Hebrew, the letters Vav and Bet are denoted by the letter %0a%3c Bet). This is because the Creator determined that this property is entirely %0a%3c sufficient for precisely evaluating and separating pure from impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if man seeks an idol in the Creator's stead, a Berachah (blessing) does %0a%3c not descend upon him, for blessing stems from the Creator alone. Thus, it is %0a%3c possible to determine who is righteous and who is a sinner, who works for the %0a%3c Creator's sake and who works for himself, for the world is built by mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Creator did not order the Light of Mercy to rule the world. He merely %0a%3c intended it for a good beginning, sufficient to bring the world to perfection. This %0a%3c is because the Light of Hassadim is incomplete (VAK, and not GAR), insufficient %0a%3c for begetting new souls, for their union and multiplication, as no Partzuf (spiritual %0a%3c object) can beget until it attains the full Light of Hochma, termed GAR or head. %0a%3c Until then, the Partzuf remains in a state of imperfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our normal (the lowest possible) state is determined by the property of the %0a%3c letter Bet. Hence, the Creator laid it as the basis for the creation of the world. In %0a%3c other words, the basis of a state is a state of a pure Partzuf (object), when nothing %0a%3c at all can diminish or impede it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, an addition of Ohr Hochma to Ohr Hassadim, necessary for %0a%3c the birth of a new Partzuf is no longer considered basic and essential. Rather, it %0a%3c is defined as an addition, i.e., it depends solely on the good deeds of the lower %0a%3c ones. And the fundamental Light, VAK, will never be lacking. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER ALEPH %0a%3c %0a%3c 38. The letter Aleph stood outside and did not enter to appear before the %0a%3c Creator. The Creator said to it: "Why do you not come to me like all the %0a%3c other letters?" Aleph replied: "Because I saw all the letters leaving your %0a%3c presence without the desired answer. And besides, I saw You presenting the %0a%3c letter Bet with this great gift. And, indeed, the King of the universe cannot %0a%3c take back his gift and give it to another!" The Creator replied: "Although I %0a%3c will create the world by the letter Bet, it is you who will stand at the head %0a%3c of all the letters, and there shall be no unity in Me, but through you alone; %0a%3c all accounts and deeds of this world shall always begin with you, and all of %0a%3c unity shall be in you alone." %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, all the letters' questions are Aliyat MAN— their individual %0a%3c requests, prayers, desires to ascend to the Creator. And the Creator's answers %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 176 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to them are called Yeridat MAD— the descent of the Light from Above, giving %0a%3c strength and abundance according to the letters' requests. The great perfection %0a%3c in the letter Aleph stems not from the lower ones' request for spiritual ascent and %0a%3c correction, but from a force (Light) descending from Above and elevating those %0a%3c that dwell below. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why from the beginning of correction to its end, Aleph (unlike the %0a%3c other letters, whose properties fuel the process of correction during the 6,000 %0a%3c years) is never stimulated to raise its request to the Creator. And only if the Light %0a%3c that bestows strength for spiritual ascent descends from Above and begins to %0a%3c shine upon Aleph will it be stimulated. However, this will only take place at the %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph did not raise its plea (MAN) to the Creator, for it saw that all the other %0a%3c letters asked, but to no avail, for there was an opposite property in the system %0a%3c of the impure forces against each of their properties. Therefore, Aleph decided %0a%3c that it was no better than the rest, that there is a corresponding impure force %0a%3c against it as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Furthermore, it raised no requests (MAN) to the Creator because it saw that %0a%3c the Creator decided to create the world with the letter Bet, mercy. And since it %0a%3c had no doubt that His decision was irrevocable, it decided not to ask Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although it is true that the world was already created with the property of %0a%3c Bet, and that the Creator will not turn His gift over to another letter, the Partzuf %0a%3c that was created by the property of Bet is incomplete, small, VAK without a head. %0a%3c And since a Partzuf needs a head in order to reach the state of Gadlut, which is %0a%3c possible only when the Partzuf is filled not only with the Light of Mercy (Has- %0a%3c sadim), but also with the Light of Wisdom (Hochma), more letters are necessary %0a%3c for the connection, conception and birth of a new Partzuf, a new state. %0a%3c %0a%3c A state of Gadlut can only be achieved with the help of the property of the %0a%3c letter Aleph. Only Aleph can bring a Partzuf to Gadlut, to supplement its body, %0a%3c VAK, with a head, GAR, Mochin— the Light of Hochma. The letter Aleph brings %0a%3c the union between ZA and Malchut in a face-to-face position, whereas previously, %0a%3c in Katnut, while being filled with only the Light of Mercy, ZA and Malchut were %0a%3c connected back-to-back. This is why Alef>h creates a head for all the letters, and %0a%3c hence stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator said: " That is why My Unity in the world is expressed only through %0a%3c the property of the letter Aleph. Furthermore, all rewards and punishments, %0a%3c distancing and drawing nearer, as well as the aspiration for spiritual correction %0a%3c (Teshuvah), all of which lead to the achievement of the end of correction, will %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 177 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c only happen by the property of the Aleph. I have made Bet the basis of the Partzuf %0a%3c so that it would be in no way dependent on the deeds of the lower ones. Thus, %0a%3c even if they begin to sin, those above will remain unaffected." %0a%3c %0a%3c He continued: "But the Light in you, Aleph, is directly related to the actions %0a%3c of the lower ones. So if they sin, the Light of Wisdom (the Light of GAR in %0a%3c you) will immediately disappear. But if they correct their actions (Teshuvah), the %0a%3c Light of Hochma will return. And My unity with all the creatures at the end of %0a%3c correction will only be realized through the letter Aleph." %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are Kelim (plural for Kli— vessel), desires. And this refers to both the %0a%3c individual letters of the alphabet and those that form words. In the names of %0a%3c spiritual objects, letters signify the force of their desire, which the Light can fill. %0a%3c Letters of a simple name, without filling, designate its basis without Light— Kli %0a%3c of Auiut zero with the Light of Nefesh. Letters of a fulfilled name designate the %0a%3c magnitude of desires that are filled by Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sources of letters: Yod and Aleph. Yod is a genuine source, for %0a%3c when we write something, we begin with a dot (Yod), and then, as we proceed %0a%3c from the dot in one of the four directions, we get a line. Letters are Kelim, %0a%3c desires, in which the Light (pleasure) is received. %0a%3c %0a%3c A desire for something specific may only emerge if: (i %0a%3c unconscious desire is filled with delight, and (ii) the delight exits the desire %0a%3c It is the memories (Reshimot) of past pleasures that lead to the emergence of a %0a%3c true desire to receive it, to feel it once more. And this is the very desire thai %0a%3c is called Kli. %0a%3c %0a%3c A filled Kli cannot be called a desire, for it is satisfied. Therefore, expulsion of %0a%3c ie Light and sensation of spiritual descent constitute the period of the creation %0a%3c ew Kelim for future receptions of Light, for new attainments. Because the %0a%3c first restriction is the reason for the disappearance of Light from all the vessels %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the second restriction is the only true root of all the worlds, %0a%3c because the first restriction was only made on a point, (Phase Four, Malchut, %0a%3c the fourth letter Hey in the Creator's name HaVaYaH). The second restriction, %0a%3c however, was made on Bina, in whom the two points, Bina and Malchut, were %0a%3c joined. The union of the two points forms a line, either vertical or horizontal. If %0a%3c it is a horizontal line, it is called "firmament" or Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c The sum of consequences of both the first and second restrictions forms %0a%3c a slanted line (\); GE (Keter-Hochma) is depicted to its right, and AHP (Bina- %0a%3c ZA-Malchut) to its left. Keter-Hochma remain on their previous level and are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 178 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c designated by the letter Yod, the first root of the world, whereas, a result of the %0a%3c second restriction, designated by a slanted line (\), Bina-ZA-Malchut fell to a lower %0a%3c level. And since the letter Yod is the first, though a very remote root of the worlds, %0a%3c and all the worlds were created afterwards and in accordance with the law of the %0a%3c second restriction, the letter Aleph stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The kind of Light that fills the spiritual Kli or Partzuf can also be seen from %0a%3c its designation: if it is filled with the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), the filling %0a%3c is designated by the letter Yod; and if it is filled with the Light of Mercy (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), it is the letter Aleph. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39. The Creator made the Upper letters, which refer to the Sefira Bina, %0a%3c large, and the lower letters that refer to Mcdchut— small. Therefore it is said: %0a%3c "BeresHeet Barah" (in the beginning He created)— two words that begin with %0a%3c Bet, and then Elokim Et (the Creator Himself)— two words that begin with %0a%3c Aleph. The first set of Aleph and Bet are letters of Bina, and the second set %0a%3c of Aleph and Bet are letters of Malchut. And they should mutually affect one %0a%3c another with their properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Upper One wishes to give Light to the lower one, it should clothe %0a%3c in the lower one, signified by the first two letters Bet and the two letters Aleph %0a%3c in the first four words of the Torah. For the first, Upper Bet is Bina, the second, %0a%3c lower Bet is ZA, and the first Bet clothes into the second one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the first Aleph refers to Bina and clothes into the second Aleph in %0a%3c ZA so as to fill it with Light. Therefore, the two letters Bet are like one letter Bet %0a%3c and the two letters Aleph are like one letter Aleph, since the lower letter merely %0a%3c constitutes the influence of the Upper One, which tells us that the Upper Partzuf %0a%3c fills the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The world cannot be created with Aleph, for the word Arm (cursed) begins %0a%3c with it, and had the world been created with Aleph, the impure forces, called %0a%3c "cursed," would have received great power from the pure forces, called Baruch %0a%3c (blessed). This is why the world (Nukva of ZA) is created with the letter Bet. %0a%3c Likewise, Adam in Nukva of ZA is also created by the power of Bet. Thus, Malchut %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut constitutes the root of all creation, all the worlds, and all %0a%3c that inhabit them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Supernal Wisdom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 40. Rabbi Yudai asked, "What does the word BERESHEET mean?" It is %0a%3c the wisdom, upon which the world, ZA, is established to enter the concealed %0a%3c supernal secrets, namely the Light of Bina. Here are the six Supernal and %0a%3c great properties, VAK de Bina, from which everything emerges. The six river %0a%3c mouths, VAK de ZA, that flow into the Great Sea (Malchut) were formed from %0a%3c them. The word BERESHEET consists of the words BARAH (created) and %0a%3c SHEET (Aramaic: six), meaning that six properties were created. Who created %0a%3c them? He who is unmentioned, concealed, and unknown: Arich Anpin. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two types of Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) in the world of Atzilut: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The original Light, Ohr Hochma of AA, called "the concealed Ohr %0a%3c Hochma." This Light of Hochma is present only in Partzuf AA and %0a%3c does not spread to the lower Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Ohr Hochma that descends via thirty-two paths from Bina, who ascended %0a%3c to Rosh de AA to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Hence, the %0a%3c word Beresheet means Be-Resheet, with-Hochma. However, this is not %0a%3c the true Ohr Hochma that is concealed in AA, but rather the Light that %0a%3c descends via thirty-two paths from Bina to ZA and sustains ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written that the world is established on the "concealed supernal secrets," %0a%3c for when ZON (called "world") receive the Light of Hochma of thirty-two paths, %0a%3c they ascend to AVI, the concealed supernal secrets. Hence, it is said that ZON %0a%3c enter the concealed supernal secrets and attain the degree of AVI, as the lower %0a%3c one that ascends to the Upper One becomes equal to it in its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word BERESHEET, besides being divided into BE-RESHEET, is also %0a%3c divided into BARAHSHEET (in Hebrew, both words are spelled the same), %0a%3c which translates as CREATED SIX— created six Sefirot (properties), called VAK %0a%3c (abbreviation of the words Vav Ketzavot, six extremities/ properties of ZA, from %0a%3c which all creatures emerge). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 179 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 180 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Bina fulfills the function of the Sefira Hochma, the source of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma for ZA. Because Maichut ascended to Bina, and Bina departed from Rosh %0a%3c de AA and became like its Guf (body), she cannot receive the Ohr Hochma of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c But then, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, human beings who %0a%3c are spiritually present in the worlds of BYA, Bina returns to Rosh de AA, receives %0a%3c Ohr Hochma from AA, passes it to ZON, and ZON pass it to all the worlds. It %0a%3c follows that all the worlds emerged from these six properties (extremities), into %0a%3c which Bina was divided. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that all six riverheads originate from Bina, and descend %0a%3c into the Great Sea. Bina's division into six properties, VAK, when she exits Rosh %0a%3c de AA, is called "six sources," for this is only a source of Light for ZA. But then, %0a%3c when Bina returns to Rosh de AA, they become Ohr Hochma, called the rivers that %0a%3c descend to Partzuf ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And they are called "six rivers," as it is written: "He will drink off the brook %0a%3c in the way; therefore, will he lift up the head" (Tehilim, 110:7). Afterwards, ZA %0a%3c passes this Light into the Great Sea, to his Nukva. The rivers and brooks signify %0a%3c the Light of ZA. VAK de Bina is considered the sources of the Light of Wisdom, %0a%3c Hochma, for it emerged from Bina in the form of VAK with the sole purpose of %0a%3c creating a source of Light for ZON. And had Bina not emerged, ZON would %0a%3c have had no chance of receiving the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word Beresheet has several meanings: Bere = Barah— created six properties %0a%3c without Ohr Hochma, as the word Barah signifies concealment. Hence, the word %0a%3c Beresheet has two meanings: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Hochma, as the word Resheet means Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Barah Sheet, which shows how the Sefira Hochma was divided into six %0a%3c parts without a Rosh, without Ohr Hochma. These six parts are the %0a%3c source of Light for ZON (called the "world"), and these six parts of ZA %0a%3c together with Maichut are called the "seven days of creation." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the word Barah is inside the word Beresheet, this means that %0a%3c it was created by "Him who is concealed and unknown," i.e., the concealed %0a%3c Hochma of Arich Anf>in, for it expelled Bina from its Rosh and turned her into %0a%3c VAK. In other words, it created the six parts described in Beresheet. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beresheet designates Hochma. The Light cannot descend to ZA until Ima-Bina %0a%3c comes outside, for because of Tzimtzum Bet, ZAT de Bina fell to ZON. Hence, when %0a%3c Bina is in Gadlut, ZA receives Ohr Hochma in his Kelim, the desires of Bina. The word %0a%3c Barah in Beresheet = Barah Sheet also means Bar (Hebrew, to exit, to transcend). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 41. Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yosi were walking along a road. As they reached a %0a%3c field, Rabbi Chiya said to Rabbi Yosi, "The words BARAH SHEET (created %0a%3c six) certainly allude to BERESHEET, for the six Supernal Days, VAKde Bina, %0a%3c shine on the Torah (ZA), while the others, QAR de Bina, are concealed." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA of the world of Atzilut is called the Torah. The six Supernal Days are VAK %0a%3c de Bina that are above ZA. Hence, the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET = %0a%3c BARAH (created) and SHEET (six) indicates that the Sefira Bina turns to the %0a%3c Sefira Hochma in order to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Since ZA is %0a%3c unable to receive all the Ohr Hochma (GAR de Hochma, the Light of the ten %0a%3c Sefirot) from Bina, but only VAK de Hochma (Light of six Sefirot), this is stressed %0a%3c in the word BARAH SHEET-CREATED SIX. This means that ZA receives %0a%3c from Bina the Light of only six Sefirot, HGT NHY or VAK de Hochma, whereas %0a%3c GAR de Hochma, the Light of Sefirot KHB, is concealed from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that although Partzuf Atik belongs to Tzimtzum Aleph %0a%3c (the first restriction), it is obliged to shine down on all the other Partzufim of %0a%3c the world of Atzilut, and on all the worlds BYA with the Light of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c Therefore, with regards to the lower Partzufim, it appears as a Partzuf that belongs %0a%3c to Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, it deliberately imposed on itself an outward (with regards to %0a%3c others) restriction of its Light, to enable the lower Partzufim to receive from it. %0a%3c Hence, it elevated Malchut from the Peh to the Eynaim and made a Zivug on the %0a%3c screen that stands in Nikvey Eynaim, thus begetting Partzuf AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why AA is a Partzuf with properties of the second restriction, and %0a%3c acts as Keter of the entire world of Atzilut instead of Atik. This was designed %0a%3c so by Partzuf Atik itself, which split into two parts: GE remained in Atik, and %0a%3c AHP became part of the second Partzuf, AA. And since Malchut ascended to NE %0a%3c %0a%3c 181 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 182 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Nikvey Eynaim), Partzuf AA remained without Malchut, the Sefira Ateret Yesod %0a%3c was used in its stead, and Malchut became concealed in the NE of Partzuf Atik. %0a%3c Also, GE de Atik became concealed from the lower Partzufim, Malchut stood in %0a%3c NE of Rosh de Atik, AHP de Atik became GE de AA, and Ateret Yesod became %0a%3c Malchut de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the subsequent Partzufim of the world of At^ilut emerged similar to %0a%3c these Partzufim. Thus, they all split into two parts, GE and AHP: Partzuf Bina %0a%3c was split into two Partzufim: GE de Bina formed Partzuf AVI and AHP de Bina %0a%3c formed Partzuf YESHSLT. Malchut ascended and remained in AVI, while Partzuf %0a%3c YESHSUT remained without Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to ZON: GE formed the big ZON and AHP formed the %0a%3c small ZON. Malchut remained in NE of the big ZON, while the small ZON have %0a%3c only nine Se/irot without Malchut, which is replaced in them by Ateret Yesod, as in %0a%3c Partzuf Atik. Therefore, just as Keter (Atik) split into two parts: GAR = Atik and %0a%3c ZAT = AA, so was Bina divided into GAR = AVI and ZAT = YESHSUT, and ZON %0a%3c into GAR = the big ZON and ZAT = the small ZON Malchut remained in GAR %0a%3c and Ateret Yesod replaced it in ZAT. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the Upper Part of each degree remains concealed, just like Partzuf %0a%3c Atik, for Malchut does not descend from the place where she had ascended (NE) %0a%3c to her previous place in the Peh. And although in Gadlut, AHP return to their %0a%3c place or ascend to their own GE (which is one and the same), GE do not become %0a%3c filled with Ohr Hochma (the Light of GAR) as a result, since Malchut remains %0a%3c concealed in GE. Moreover, Malchut exists under the ban of T^imt^um Aleph on %0a%3c the reception of Ohr Hochma. Hence, GE remain with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only the lower part of each degree is filled with the Light of GAR (Hochma) %0a%3c in Gadlut: there was Avir (air) = Aleph-Vav-Yod-Reish, then the letter Yod departed %0a%3c from this word, and only the letters Ale£>h-Vat/-Reish remained to form the word %0a%3c Ohr (Light)-Ohr Hochma or GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that all Partzufim of the world of At^ilut have GE, GAR of Kelim, %0a%3c Sefirot KHB HGT with Ohr Hassadim, the Light of VAK, whereas AHP, Sefirot %0a%3c NHY, Vak de Kelim in the Gadlut of the Partzuf are filled with Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c the Light of GAR. GE (GAR de Kelim) are filled with the Light of VAK (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), and AHP (VAK de Kelim) are filled with the Light of GAR (Ohr %0a%3c Hochma). It is therefore said that there's no greater Light for ZA in the world %0a%3c of Atzilut than the Light of VAK = six days, while GAR are concealed even in %0a%3c the Partzufim above ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 183 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 42. However, it is said in the secrets of creation of BERESHEET that He %0a%3c who is Holy and Concealed established the laws in Bina, in the secret and %0a%3c concealed, meaning Mcdchut of Partzuf Atik, which is a Partzuf with Mcdchut %0a%3c of Tzimtzum Aleph, who ascended to Bina and removed AHP de AA below %0a%3c its Rosh. And the same law that He established in Bina He established and %0a%3c concealed within, and everything is locked under one key. And He hid this key %0a%3c in a hall. And although everything is hidden in that hall, the most important %0a%3c thing is in that key, for it locks and unlocks everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c HE WHO IS HOLY AND CONCEALED is AA, for its Hochma is concealed. %0a%3c THE LAWS ARE ESTABLISHED IN IT, meaning in Malchut de Atik. The %0a%3c deficiency of the Kelim de AHP is confirmed. Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph, called %0a%3c "the central point of all creation," is also the sole creation on which Tzimtzum %0a%3c Aleph was imposed. Contrary to her, if the screen stands not in Malchut, but in %0a%3c Yesod or, more precisely, in Ateret Yesod, the place of the covenant (circumcision), %0a%3c the place of the Zivug that was permitted after Tzimtzum Bet, this screen allows %0a%3c for the reception of Light. Hence, it is called the "point of population," and not %0a%3c the "central point." %0a%3c %0a%3c - Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c - Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA— Malchut that received ZA's properties to "bestow," the popu- %0a%3c %0a%3c lated place %0a%3c %0a%3c - Malchut— no Zivug can be made; the deserted place %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that there is no GAR in AA, for the Supernal Malchut of Atik, %0a%3c within AA, is already corrected to the point of being in NE of her own Partzuf. %0a%3c In Gacllut, the screen descends from NE to Peh, which makes AHP return to %0a%3c their place, and a Zivug transpires on all ten Sefirot, which receive the GAR of %0a%3c the Light, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the screen in NE is called a "lock," for it blocks the entry of GAR %0a%3c of the Light into the Partzuf. The GAR of the Light are called Ohr Hochma. Yet, %0a%3c by descending from NE to Peh, the screen lets the Light into the Partzuf, and is %0a%3c therefore called Nikvey Eynaim (pupils of the eyes). %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Atik itself is in NE together with Malchut, it affects AA, and not %0a%3c Atik itself, as AA was created by the screen, located not in Malchut, but in Ateret %0a%3c Yesod (or simply in Yesod), and there is no Malchut in it. This is why it is not %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 184 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut that rules in NE de AA, but Ateret Yesod. And this is why, unlike the %0a%3c Light of Atik, its Light can be attained, for Malchut in Atik is the central point, %0a%3c which does not make a Zivug on Ohr Hochma. Although with regards to Atik, AA %0a%3c is AHP of Atik, AA itself has its own GE and AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, AA created AVI and confirmed the absence of Ohr Hochma in %0a%3c them, due to the absence of AHP de Kelim. These AHP are the HALL in which %0a%3c the entire Light of Hochma is concealed (GAR de Neshama, GAR de Haya, and %0a%3c GAR de Yechida). This KEY IS KEPT HIDDEN IN A HALL Bina is a hall for %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Malchut ascends to GAR de Bina (AVI) and rules there, but the %0a%3c absence of Ohr Hochma is not felt there, for the properties of AVI want only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim; this is what is important to them, as it completely substitutes the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. And VAK de Bina is ruled by the key, Ateret Yesod. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THAT KEY, FOR IT LOCKS AND UNLOCKS EVERYTHING— %0a%3c concealments and revelations are made by Malchut that stands in NE: when %0a%3c Malchut ascends to NE she conceals Ohr Hochma, since in such a case, the Partzuf %0a%3c remains without its Kelim of AHP— it cannot use its desires to "receive" for the %0a%3c Creator's sake. Consequently, it contains no Ohr Hochma, for Ohr Hochma can %0a%3c only be received in Kelim de AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when a Partzuf receives strength from Above to resist the egoistic %0a%3c desires of reception of its Kelim de AHP, and can receive for the Creator's sake, %0a%3c this means that it has acquired a screen against its desires, and can also work %0a%3c with them for the Creator. It then brings its Malchut back from the NE to the %0a%3c Peh. Put differently, it elevates its Kelim (desires of AHP) to the Rosh and begins %0a%3c to calculate how much Light it can receive within them for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c However, the received pleasure must not be too great, or it will make the Partzuf %0a%3c enjoy it egoistically. Afterwards, the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma in its Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, only Malchut that stands in NE allows or forbids the Light from %0a%3c entering the Partzuf. And since she must let the Light into the Partzuf in ZAT %0a%3c (where the rule belongs not to Malchut that ascended to NE, but to Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c called "key"), whereas the GAR of each Partzuf remain with Ohr Hassadim (they %0a%3c desire only the Light of Hassadim), letting the Light in or preventing it from %0a%3c entering the Partzuf depends only on the key, and not on Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 43. That hall conceals tremendous treasures piled one upon the other. And %0a%3c there are fifty tightly closed gates in that hall, which are meant to block %0a%3c access to the Light. They were divided into four sides and became forty-nine %0a%3c gates, for one gate has no side, and it is unknown whether it exists above or %0a%3c below. Hence, it remained closed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 185 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There are many types of GAR: GAR of Ohr Neshama, Haya, or Yechida. Each %0a%3c of them contains countless individual degrees and details. Hence, it is written, %0a%3c ONE UPON THE OTHER. Yet, as long as Malchut stands in NE, all these %0a%3c degrees of Light remain concealed and unknown. %0a%3c %0a%3c A gate signifies a vessel— a desire to receive the Light. In the spiritual world, %0a%3c there are no bodies, only desires. The desire itself is called "a body." If there is no %0a%3c desire, there is no body, as there is no vessel to receive the Light (pleasure). The %0a%3c bigger the desire, the "bigger" the body. However, all the bodies are similar in %0a%3c structure; just as a human body in our world consists of 613 parts, the spiritual %0a%3c body consists of 613 spiritual parts (desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c If one is able to use one of the desires of his spiritual body for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, such action is referred to as a Mitzva (commandment, good deed). The %0a%3c received Light is called "Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c A spiritual Partzuf has a Rosh (head), the place where decisions are made. %0a%3c It contains only those desires that are known to be fit with a screen (resistance %0a%3c to the desires) to use them spiritually, altruistically, and to "reverse" them from %0a%3c "for one's own sake" to "for the sake of the Creator." If one has fulfilled all 613 %0a%3c commandments of the Torah and the seven Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) of the %0a%3c nations of the world (620 Mitzvot in all), he thereby ascends 620 degrees and %0a%3c completely merges with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c To observe all the commandments means to completely fill one's spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf with the Light of the Torah by fulfilling observant commandments %0a%3c (Mitzvot Aseh— positive Mitzvot) and prohibitory commandments (Mitzvot Lo %0a%3c Taaseh— negative Mitzvot). The fulfillment of the later lies in the unwillingness to %0a%3c receive the pleasure that is found within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two types of desires or gates: when they are closed and receive %0a%3c nothing, and when they open and receive the Upper Light. When they are %0a%3c all closed, there are fifty of them. However, only forty-nine of the fifty can be %0a%3c opened. There are ten Sefirot KHB HGT NHYM or five Sefirot KHB ZA-M (as ZA %0a%3c consists of six Sefirot HGT NHY). However, Malchut also consists of these six, %0a%3c and hence includes all ten Sefirot. And since each of the five Sefirot consists of %0a%3c ten, in all they make up fifty. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since a Zivug is made not on Malchut, but on Ateret Yesod, Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut itself does not receive the Light. Instead, Light is received by the four %0a%3c Sefirot KHB ZA that precede Malchut. Each of them consists of ten, hence 4 x 10 = %0a%3c 40 plus nine Sefirot from Keter to Yesod in Malchut herself yields 40 + 9 = 49. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 186 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Only one Sefira (Malchut de Malchut) out of the fifty does not receive the %0a%3c Light. This is because until all the Kelim (desires) have been completely corrected, %0a%3c the Light cannot enter it, as it is known in advance that Malchut de Malchut has %0a%3c no strength to oppose such a powerful egoistic desire to receive pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Instead of being in Malchut de Malchut, the screen stands in Yesod de %0a%3c Malchut, and this place is called Brith (Covenant), the place where the Mitzva of %0a%3c circumcision must be kept, so as to make a Zivug not on Malchut herself (on the %0a%3c first restriction), but on Yesod, or rather, Ateret Yesod (on the second restriction). %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut itself is called "Shaar Nun" (the 50 th gate). This refers to %0a%3c Malchut of each Partzuf in the worlds ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And although Malchut of Partzuf AVI descends from NE de AVI to her place %0a%3c in Peh, while AHP and YESHSUT that clothe them ascend to the degree of %0a%3c AVI, and AVI merges with YESHSUT into one Partzuf, as a result of which, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma descends to them from AA, AVI are unwilling and therefore do %0a%3c not receive anything from Ohr Hochma, and remain only with Ohr Hassadim, as %0a%3c though Malchut had never even descended from E^nazm to Peh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is impossible to tell by the Light of AVI whether Malchut is %0a%3c located at the NE or at the Peh. On the contrary, by looking at AVI, it always %0a%3c seems to us that Malchut stands at NE. Only by the state of YESHSUT can we %0a%3c determine Malchut's location, for when she ascends to AVI in Gadlut (big state), %0a%3c YESHSUT receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although Malchut herself can receive Ohr Hochma in AVI, since AVI receive %0a%3c no Ohr Hochma whatsoever, they do not utilize their own Malchut. Since %0a%3c YESHSUT already has Ateret Yesod instead of Malchut, it receives the Light or %0a%3c "opens up," whereas AVI remain closed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the absence of the 50 th gate, the Zivug on Malchut herself in %0a%3c YESHSUT, causes the absence of the corresponding Light of Hochma in all the %0a%3c Partzufim. It is written about it: "fifty gates of Bina, and all are given to Moshe, %0a%3c except for one, the last secret of the absence of the Upper Light." For this %0a%3c Upper Light can be received only within the Kelim (desires) of Malchut herself, %0a%3c of primordial egoism, which will occur at the end of all the corrections, at the %0a%3c completion of the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c 44. Those gates have one lock with a narrow space inside for inserting the %0a%3c key. It is unmarked, and recognized only by the impress of the key, which is %0a%3c unknown in that narrow space, but only in the key itself. And it is written of %0a%3c this secret: BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED). "In the beginning" is the key, and all is concealed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Lock and the Key %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 187 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c within it, as it unlocks and locks. And six gates are contained in this key, %0a%3c which locks and unlocks. When it locks those gates, encloses them within %0a%3c itself, it is written IN THE BEGINNING (BERESHEET): a revealed word, %0a%3c though it is usually concealed. BARAH (CREATED) is a concealed word %0a%3c everywhere, implying that the key unlocks it and locks it up. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut that stands in NE is called a "lock," for she prevents Ohr Hochma %0a%3c from entering the Partzuf. The entire Partzuf ends in Hochma (the Light can only %0a%3c be in K-H). Hence, it is merely Nefesh-Ruach. After all, in the absence of Kelim- %0a%3c Sefirot B-ZA-M, the Lights Neshama-Haya-Yechida are absent. Yesod de Malchut is %0a%3c the 49 th gate, the maximum that can be before the end of correction, for Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut itself is the 50 th gate. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the key (Ateret Yesod of the Light) enters Yesod de Malchut (the 49 th gate), %0a%3c then this Light lowers Malchut to her place, from NE to Peh. This Light opens %0a%3c the Partzuf and Ohr Hochma fills it. This is why Ateret Yesod is called a "key." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there is a special Reshimo that allows one to not use Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut as a place of Zivug before the final correction of all the others (except %0a%3c for Malchut de Malchut, Kelim-desires). This Reshimo is in AVI: since they never %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma (they do not use this key), their real AHP do not ascend. %0a%3c Nevertheless, even their false AHP is sufficient to let YESHSUT receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma and realize that knowledge signifies the presence of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Light that corresponds to Ateret Yesod enters the corresponding Sefira %0a%3c in Malchut (in Yesod de Malchut, the 49 th Sefira), then Malchut (the 50 th gate) does %0a%3c not forbid this Light to fill the Partzuf, does not "lock up" the Partzuf, as she %0a%3c contains the Reshimo of prohibition only on that which enters Malchut herself. %0a%3c The reason for it is that the Reshimo (the key's memory) rules in ZAT de Bina, %0a%3c that is, in YESHSUT. Hence, this Light is called a "key." %0a%3c %0a%3c And the word BERESHEET-IN THE BEGINNING-includes in itself only %0a%3c the key (Ateret Yesod, the 49 th Sefira), excluding Malchut de Malchut, the 50 th gate. %0a%3c However, none of the Sefirot KHB of all the Partzufim of the world of At^ilut %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma; Ohr Hassadim shines within them instead. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words IN THE BEGINNING CREATED (BERESHEET %0a%3c BARAH) mean CONCEALED HOCHMA, for the word BARAH (created) is %0a%3c derived from the notion of BAR (beyond), which signifies moving Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut beyond the reception of Ohr Hochma; hence, this part of the Kelim was %0a%3c locked up by the absence of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVRAHAM %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 45. Rabbi Yosi said, "I heard from the great source of Light, i.e., from Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon Bar-Yochai, that BARAH is a concealed word, the key to which locked %0a%3c it up and did not unlock it. And since the key locked up the word BARAH, %0a%3c there was no world and no possibility of its existence, and nothingness enveloped %0a%3c all. And when nothingness rules, there is no world, nor its existence." %0a%3c %0a%3c 46. So when did this key unlock those gates, and everything became ready for %0a%3c the existence and evolution of the generations? When Avraham appeared, %0a%3c as he is the property of Hesed (mercy), of which it is written, "These are %0a%3c the generations of Heaven and earth Be-Hibar'am (with which He built)." %0a%3c However, one should pronounce the word not as Be-Hibar'am, but as %0a%3c Be-AvraHom (in Hebrew, these two words consist of the same letters, but in %0a%3c a slightly different order). Then, all that was concealed in the word BARAH %0a%3c was revealed as letters, meaning that the Kelim opened up to listen. And there %0a%3c appears the Pillar of Procreation, the sacred Yesod, upon which the world's %0a%3c existence is based, for the word BARAH consists of the same letters as the %0a%3c word AVAR (passed). %0a%3c %0a%3c He asks: "When it is revealed, can one act and produce generations?" This %0a%3c question includes three questions: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. When will it be revealed? When Malchut descends from the Eynaim %0a%3c (where she ascended as a result of Tzimtzum Bet) to her previous %0a%3c place in the Peh, which leads to the revelation of the forty-nine gates %0a%3c of Hochma; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. When can it be used? When Ohr Hochma clothes in Ohr Hassadim, as %0a%3c a result of which AHP can receive Ohr Hochma, for unless it is clothed %0a%3c in Ohr Hassadim, Ml = GE cannot shine within ELEH = AHP, as the %0a%3c Light is not yet suitable for reception and use by the lower ones; %0a%3c %0a%3c 189 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 190 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. What does it mean to produce, multiply generations? Generations %0a%3c are the souls that exist in the worlds BYA, begotten by ZA de Atzilut. %0a%3c After ZA receives the Lights of Hochma and Hassadim (the Light of %0a%3c perfection), this Light enables him to make a Zivug with Nukva and %0a%3c beget the souls of the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD OF AK %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD OF ATZILUT: AA of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c AVI of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut produce and feed the souls of the righteous %0a%3c %0a%3c — Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD OF BERIA %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD OF YETZIRA the souls of the righteous in the worlds BYA %0a%3c WORLD ORASSIYA %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom, the transition from egoism to altruism %0a%3c %0a%3c OUR EGOISTIC WORLD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham is the property of the Sefira Hesed in Partzuf ZA during its Gadlut (bi£ %0a%3c state), when Hesed ascends and becomes Hochma: Sefirot HGT become HBD: %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed ) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah J %0a%3c %0a%3c P %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HBD {HaBaD) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HGT (HaGaT) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NHY(AfeffY) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVRAHAM %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 191 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Before Avraham appeared, everything was concealed in the word BARAH %0a%3c and nothingness ruled over the world— there was neither Ohr Hochma nor Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim in ZON. However, when Avraham (the Light of Hesed that descends %0a%3c to ZA) appeared, the gates were opened for Ohr Hochma, for Malchut descended %0a%3c from Eynaim to Peh, and YESHSUT merged with AVI into one degree, which %0a%3c led to the descent of Ohr Hochma to YESHSUT, for Ohr Hassadim of Avraham's %0a%3c properties was already present in ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma then clothed in Ohr Hassadim, Ml (GE) joined ELEH (AHP), %0a%3c the Creator's name ELO-IM was completed, and Hochma filled ZA. Then Malchut %0a%3c descended from Eynaim to Peh in ZA, and ZA received new AHP from Bina, %0a%3c thereby entering Gadlut and passing the Light through his Yesod into Malchut, %0a%3c called the "lower world." As a result, Malchut begets the souls of the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47. When Yesod of ZA joins the word BARAH (Malchut), there occurs a %0a%3c concealed and supernal division of the Creator's name and greatness, called %0a%3c MI, and ELEH comes into being. Also, the sacred name MA comes from %0a%3c BARAH. The sacred concealed ELEH exists just like Yesod. Yet, when Yesod %0a%3c attains its complete state, the Partzuf attains its complete state, the letter Hey %0a%3c corresponds to Yesod and the letter Yod— to ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, The Zohar clarifies which Light is present in ZA, depending on his %0a%3c states. In the Sefira Yesod of Partzuf ZA there is an end, meaning a place of %0a%3c contact with Malchut, the place of the covenant between the Creator (ZA) and %0a%3c the Shechina (the souls of the righteous), also called "Israel" or Malchut. This %0a%3c place of contact is called Ateret Yesod (encirclement of Yesod) or Keter de ZA (the %0a%3c crown of ZA). %0a%3c %0a%3c The word BARAH signifies Katnut (small state), which comes as a result %0a%3c of Malchut's ascent to NE. AVI never abandon the properties of GAR de Bina %0a%3c (properties of mercy); they do not desire to receive. Having ascended and %0a%3c standing in them, Malchut is called Man'ula (lock), which prevents the Light from %0a%3c spreading below her. Ateret Yesod de ZA is called Miftacha (key), for it is through %0a%3c its property that the Light can be received in the Partzufim located below AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is possible on condition that ELEH = AHP ascend to MI = GE. Ohr %0a%3c Hochma can be received in the Kelim ELEH that wish to receive it, but only upon %0a%3c their ascension above Parsa. However, until the properties of Malchut acquire %0a%3c the property of Bina, until they are "softened" by this property, there is no way %0a%3c to receive the Light, and Malchut is called "the 50 th gate." %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, we see that the words MI BARAH ELEH signify not the question, %0a%3c "Who created these?" but the action: MI = GE BARAH (created) ELEH = AHP by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 192 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the descent of Malchut from NE back to Peh. As a result, ELEH = AHP ascended %0a%3c to the Rosh and there received the Light of GAR (Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon descending to Peh, Malchut is called MA, as that is the name of the %0a%3c lower world. Her screen in the Peh makes a Zivug, onto which descends Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, called "Light of blessing," for it abolishes the prohibition and the lock %0a%3c imposed on the diffusion of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48. When the letters Hey and Yod wished to complement one another, the %0a%3c letter Mem emerged from them, and the word ELO-HIM = ELE + Hey + %0a%3c Yod + Mem was formed by the union of both sides. The word AVAR + Hey %0a%3c + Mem = Avraham originated from ELEH. However, one might say that the %0a%3c Creator took the words ELEH and MI, joined them and formed the word %0a%3c ELOKIM, whereas the words MA and AVAR formed the word Avraham, %0a%3c where the word MI designates the fifty gates of Bina, and the word MA refers %0a%3c to the numerical value of the holy name, for HaVaYaH with the filling of the %0a%3c letter Aleph forms the Qematria of MA— 45. %0a%3c %0a%3c Both this world and the world to come exist in these two letters, Yod and %0a%3c Hey. This world is in Yod, and the world to come is in Hey. Hence, the world to %0a%3c come was created with MI, and this world with MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: "These are the created (Be-Hibar'am) generations %0a%3c of Heaven and earth," where the letters Be-Hibar'am make up the word %0a%3c "Avraham," for there was no perfection until the letters formed this word. %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator's name HaVaYaH is first mentioned in the Torah only %0a%3c after the name Avraham. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim in MA and Ohr Hochma in ELEH wished to complement one %0a%3c another and be complemented within one another. As a result, Ohr Hochma %0a%3c clothed in Ohr Hassadim, and Malchut receives from both Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%3c In so doing, MA and MI join and create MM, i.e., Malchut that receives Ohr %0a%3c Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 49. Rabbi Chiya prostrated himself on the ground and kissed it. He wept and %0a%3c said: "Dust, how hard and heartless you are, how many you have consumed, %0a%3c all the pillars of Light and all the great souls were consumed by you. And %0a%3c the greatest of all, Rabbi Shimon, the Light of the entire world, of all the %0a%3c worlds, who illuminates and governs over the descending Light, upon which %0a%3c our world exists, is also consumed by you, and yet you govern the world?" But %0a%3c then he collected himself at once and said: "Do not be proud, dust, for the %0a%3c pillars of the world will not be betrayed to you, and Rabbi Shimon will not be %0a%3c consumed by you!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is the sole creation. And this sole creation is nothing but a desire %0a%3c to receive pleasure. It was made this way, and its essence cannot be changed. %0a%3c Yet, what can be changed is the intention— for which or whose sake to receive %0a%3c the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Malchut's union with Bina with an altruistic will to bestow %0a%3c delight, give pleasure, Malchut acquires Bina 's desire in addition to her own. That %0a%3c is, an additional desire appears in Malchut— to bestow, opposite to her nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only this desire of Bina in Malchut can result in a Zivug and reception of %0a%3c Light. When Malchut receives all the desires that she possibly can from Bina, %0a%3c and fills them with Light, only her own initial egoistic property will remain %0a%3c uncorrected, but even that will be corrected from Above by the Creator Himself. %0a%3c The order of correction and reception of Light in Bina s properties inside of %0a%3c Malchut is referred to as the reception on the Zivug of Yesod, and it takes place %0a%3c sequentially along 6,000 degrees, called "6,000 years." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut of the world of At^ilut cannot receive any Light during the %0a%3c 6,000 years until all of its parts are completely corrected. All the Zivugim (plural %0a%3c for Zivug) throughout the 6,000 years are made not on Malchut herself, but on %0a%3c the properties she received from Bina. The place of such a Zivug is called Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c 193 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 194 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c de Malchut or Ateret Yesod. Whereas Malchut herself (egoistic desires) remains %0a%3c closed to the Light, and is therefore called the "closed gates." %0a%3c %0a%3c The reception of Light during the 6,000 years, correction of the Partzufim, %0a%3c and the gradual filling of Malchut with the Light, takes place with the help of %0a%3c Bina's desires in Malchut, which are called Miftacha (Yesod de Malchut), for the %0a%3c impure (egoistic) force has no power over this part of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod de Malchut means that Malchut only acts with the properties she received %0a%3c from a Higher Sefira— Yesod, which is free from the influence of the impure forces %0a%3c (Klipot). All the properties, except for those of Malchut, are altruistic, since they %0a%3c originate from Bina. However, since we wish to emphasize that a Zivug is made %0a%3c on an altruistic desire, above the egoistic desire of Malchut, we usually say Yesod %0a%3c instead of Bina. And since Yesod is the Sefira immediately above Malchut, we say %0a%3c that a Zivug is made not on the egoistic desires of Malchut, but on Yesod. And %0a%3c since, upon acquiring the properties of Yesod, Malchut can receive the Light, %0a%3c such reception of Light on Yesod de Malchut is called "Miftacha" (from the word %0a%3c Mafte'ach, key)— the key that opens the way for the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since Malchut herself, that is, Malchut de Malchut ("closed gates") %0a%3c remains inaccessible to the Light for 6,000 years, Rabbi Chiya (a particular %0a%3c spiritual degree) could not understand how Rabbi Shimon (the spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon) could achieve such complete perfection. Indeed, %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon is a Partzuf of such spiritual height that it receives the Light of %0a%3c Yechida. And it is impossible to receive this Light without utilizing a Zivug on %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, this part of Malchut remains uncorrected until the completion of %0a%3c the 6,000 years (the end of correction), and thus cannot be used. By defying %0a%3c these desires, it is as though one has already partially corrected it. And all the %0a%3c prohibitory commandments refer to Malchut de Malchut; hence, the ban imposed %0a%3c on its use is called "a restriction." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if it is impossible to fill the "stony heart" (Lev HaEven), i.e., Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut (the root of egoism, the basis of creation), with Light, how can %0a%3c even a single soul achieve complete correction? After all, complete correction %0a%3c implies the reception of Light in the entire Malchut. Each soul, each part of %0a%3c Malchut that man is destined to correct contains a part of all the other parts of %0a%3c Malchut, including a part of Malchut de Malchut, which he may not work with %0a%3c until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, Rabbi Chiya sees Rabbi Shimon in a state of %0a%3c complete correction. So how could the latter have attained such state? This %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 195 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c contradiction roused Rabbi Chiya so greatly that he prostrated himself on the %0a%3c ground and cried out. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to constantly "translate" the words of the Torah or The %0a%3c Zohar into a language we can understand, that "ground" signifies egoism and %0a%3c "dust" refers to the impure forces, that "crying out" implies raising MAN, and so %0a%3c forth. All the words and definitions in the text of The Zohar should be perceived %0a%3c ;nsuously rather than literally, as physical actions of our world. In other words, %0a%3c sver The Zohar speaks of is related only to inner, spiritual sensations anc %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All the worlds constitute the "environment," the spiritual sphere, within %0a%3c which the Creator made His only creation— man (Adam). Everything else was %0a%3c created only in order to help man to achieve his spiritual mission of becoming %0a%3c like his Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as in our world, the world itself and all its inhabitants, except man, are %0a%3c aerated by their animal nature, rather than creatures with free will, in %0a%3c lal worlds, all the spiritual beings, except for the soul, are operated by %0a%3c leir spiritual nature. Upon being born in our world, man, too, is an animal %0a%3c without freedom to act against his egoistic desire to receive pleasure. He usually %0a%3c stays that way throughout his existence on earth, being not at all different from %0a%3c le still, vegetative, and animate levels of nature, automatically following orders %0a%3c ler master, egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c with the help of Kabbalah can one gradually receive Upper, spiritual %0a%3c strength, and consequently acquire freedom of choice, that is, liberate himself from %0a%3c the influence of the impure, egoistic forces, and become free in his desires, like the %0a%3c Creator. However, such an opportunity is only given to one who can control his %0a%3c automatically-driven, egoistic nature: according to the strength of his screen, man %0a%3c ascends (moves inwardly, in his sensations) from this world to the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c After creating the spiritual worlds as a home for his future creation, the %0a%3c Creator created the creature (soul, Adam). The soul constitutes the desire to %0a%3c delight in the sensation of the Creator, of His Light. The sensation of the %0a%3c Creator is called "Light." There is nothing else in the entire universe besides %0a%3c the Light and the soul! %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the soul itself is Malchut de Malchut (the only egoistic creation), %0a%3c the Creator imparted onto it the property of altruism, having created it mixed %0a%3c with the Kelim (desires) of Bina, thereby demonstrating how wonderful it would %0a%3c be to be like Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c While performing altruistic actions, the soul (Adam) decided to use its %0a%3c natural egoism, Malchut de Malchut itself, to receive the Creator's Light with %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 196 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c altruistic intentions. Yet, when it began to let the tremendous Light of Yechida %0a%3c into Malchut de Malchut, it could not resist and wished to enjoy it egoistically. %0a%3c This change in the soul's desires is referred to as its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the fall, Adam's soul split into myriad parts (600,000), all of %0a%3c which fell into captivity of impure, egoistic forces (acquired egoistic desires). %0a%3c After the fall, Adam corrected some of the souls (obtained an anti-egoistic %0a%3c screen), but only partially. And then, of the total number of souls, some were %0a%3c selected for correction, lowered into this world, and clothed into bodies, %0a%3c generation after generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The descent (distancing from the Creator) into our world (egoistic %0a%3c sensations of only one's own desires) occurs as a result of attaching an additional %0a%3c "makeweight" of egoism to the soul. In the spiritual world, movement (farther %0a%3c from the Creator or closer to Him) and distance (from Him) are determined by %0a%3c the correlation of egoistic and altruistic desires within the soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The purpose behind the souls' descent to our world is to transform one's %0a%3c egoistic desires with the help of Kabbalah, and to return to the Creator with %0a%3c one's intentions, by performing altruistic actions. The souls' descent continues %0a%3c until each of them and all of them together achieve complete correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the most exalted souls that refer to the degrees of Yechida and GAR %0a%3c of Haya depend on the correction of Malchut herself in Malchut of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut ("closed gates"). These will only be corrected at the completion of %0a%3c the 6,000 years, after the correction of all the rest. This is due to the inverse %0a%3c relationship between the souls and the Light that fills them: the more egoistic %0a%3c the soul is, and the lower it is located, the greater the Light that enters the %0a%3c general Partzuf (the common soul) at the time of its correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LIGHT OF SOULS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MALCHUT (types of souls) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why these exalted souls are consumed by dust (impure force), i.e., %0a%3c the impure force rules over them with its enormous and insolent power, for it is %0a%3c certain that no one and nothing can save these souls from captivity. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Rabbi Chiya wept: "Dust, how cruel you are!" That the most %0a%3c exalted souls are "consumed by you without any hope of escaping you!" In other %0a%3c words, the actual root of creation, the primordial egoism cannot be corrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that as a result of the exalted souls' captivity by the rule of %0a%3c the impure forces, all the righteous that bring Light to the entire world cannot %0a%3c achieve perfection themselves. Since all the souls are interconnected, not a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 197 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c single individual soul can arrive at the end of correction until all the souls are %0a%3c corrected. This is why they are susceptible to the ruthless rule of the dust. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, Rabbi Chiya wanted to say that Rabbi Shimon himself was also %0a%3c consumed by dust, i.e., did not achieve complete correction. He had heard that %0a%3c Rabbi Yosi also reasons that the closed gates are closed for all. Yet, after some %0a%3c contemplation, he inquired: "If Rabbi Shimon revives all the worlds and governs %0a%3c them, how can it possibly be that he has not reached perfection?" %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he concludes that Rabbi Shimon was not consumed by the %0a%3c dust, that he did achieve complete correction and is probably in a state of %0a%3c absolute perfection. The thing that Rabbi Chiya could not understand, how- %0a%3c ever, is how any individual soul could achieve the end of correction prior to %0a%3c (without) the complete correction of all the others. This, Rabbi Chiya could %0a%3c not explain to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50. Rabbi Chiya stood up and started to walk and weep. Rabbi Yosi joined %0a%3c him. He fasted for forty days so that he might see Rabbi Shimon. He was %0a%3c told he still was not worthy of seeing him. He wept and fasted for another %0a%3c forty days. He was then shown a vision: Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi %0a%3c Elazar were discussing him, Rabbi Chiya, the words he said to Rabbi Yosi, and %0a%3c thousands are listening in on their discussion. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the fasting that The Zohar speaks of is a spiritual act, in our world %0a%3c such a description is a good example of how strong a desire should be in order %0a%3c to be answered from Above. Other spiritual actions include weeping, tears— %0a%3c the small state (Katnut) of a spiritual Partzuf, in this case referred to as "Rabbi %0a%3c Chiya." Naturally, Rabbi Shimon and all the other characters of The Zohar are %0a%3c spiritual Partzufim, rather than people of our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Truth be told, the spiritual level of a person known by a certain name in %0a%3c our world may coincide with his spiritual root described in the Torah. However, %0a%3c elucidation of this matter exceeds the scope of this particular article. It is %0a%3c nonetheless essential to note that Pharaoh in the corporeal Egypt, naturally, %0a%3c was not a spiritual Pharaoh, the way he is described in The Zohar (the Partzuf that %0a%3c includes all of Malchut), and Laban, portrayed in the Torah as a villain, is in fact %0a%3c the Supernal Spiritual Light of Partzuf AB, the Supernal Light of Hochma. This %0a%3c will be explained later on. %0a%3c %0a%3c The strong desire to attain the degree of Rabbi Shimon allowed Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c to see him, for he was certain that Rabbi Shimon had not been consumed by %0a%3c the dust. He came to this conclusion precisely because of his conversation with %0a%3c Rabbi Yosi, and hence passionately desired to see Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 198 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 51. In that same vision, Rabbi Chiya saw several great celestial wings: how %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon and his son Rabbi Elazar mounted them and soared to the %0a%3c Assembly of Heaven, while the wings waited for them. Afterwards, they both %0a%3c returned to their place and shone brighter than ever before, brighter than the %0a%3c light of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of the angel Matatron. %0a%3c However, his full name is not pronounced, and the name Matat is used instead, %0a%3c for pronouncing a name is equivalent to an action, which is not always desirable. %0a%3c The term Supernal Assembly refers to the Assembly of the Creator Himself, %0a%3c while the Heavenly Assembly refers to the Assembly of Matat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wings that were waiting for Rabbi Shimon and his son Elazar are angels %0a%3c (spiritual forces, similar to robots or draft animals in our world), whose task is to %0a%3c help the souls to ascend from one spiritual degree to another. And just as these %0a%3c wings must assist the souls in their ascent, they must assist them to descend to %0a%3c their places. Therefore, it is said that the wings were waiting for Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c and his son Rabbi Elazar to bring them back down. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when Rabbi Chiya saw them returning from the Heavenly Assembly %0a%3c back to their place (to Rabbi Shimon's Assembly), he noticed a new light on %0a%3c their faces, and radiance surrounded them that was brighter than the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c 52. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "Let Rabbi Chiya enter and see how much %0a%3c the Creator renews the faces of the righteous in the world to come. Happy is %0a%3c he who comes here without shame. Happy is he who stands in the other world %0a%3c as a rigid pillar opposite all." And Rabbi Chiya saw himself entering, and %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar and all the other pillars of the world that were there stood up %0a%3c before Rabbi Chiya. And he, Rabbi Chiya, was ashamed; he entered, bending, %0a%3c and sat at the feet of Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon opened (opened the way for the Light) and said: "Happy is he %0a%3c who enters without shame." And all that were present there felt no shame. Only %0a%3c Rabbi Chiya was ashamed. This is because they had the strength to withstand the %0a%3c power of the dust, and Rabbi Chiya did not. They were all perfect, whereas Rabbi %0a%3c Chiya had a flaw— the desire to attain. And this is what he was ashamed of. %0a%3c %0a%3c 53. A voice sounded: "Lower your eyes, do not raise your head, and do not %0a%3c look." He lowered his eyes and saw Light that shone from afar. The voice %0a%3c returned and said: "The Supernal Ones, concealed and enclosed, who have %0a%3c eyes that watch over the entire world, look and see: the lower ones are sleeping, %0a%3c and the Light of their eyes is concealed in their pupils. Wake them!" %0a%3c %0a%3c After he followed the instruction to lower his eyes and not raise his head (not %0a%3c use his desire to receive Light, but only desires to bestow), he merited hearing %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 199 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Light of Hassadim) the appeal, with the help of which he attained everything %0a%3c he wished. The voice divides all souls into two groups: the first is a group of %0a%3c Supernal Holy Ones that are concealed, who merited their eyes to be opened to %0a%3c behold the entire world, and the second group of souls have the Light of their %0a%3c eyes concealed in their eye-sockets, which is what blinded them. This is why the %0a%3c voice called upon the souls of the first group to behold, i.e., to use the reception %0a%3c of the Upper Light, to draw the Upper Light together with the second group. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54. Who among you turns darkness into Light and savors bitter as sweet even %0a%3c before he came here, that is, while still living in the other world? Who among %0a%3c you hopes and waits each day for the Light that shines when the Lord distances, %0a%3c when His greatness grows and He is called the King of all kings of the world? %0a%3c For he who does not wait for this each day while living in this world, has no %0a%3c place in the other world either. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's goal is for man to fully attain Him while still living in this %0a%3c world, to feel Him as he did prior to descending into this world, prior to %0a%3c incarnating in a physical body. From this the division of people of our world %0a%3c into two groups is clearly evident, and the voice appeals to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The voice emphasizes to each group their main advantage. To the souls %0a%3c of the first group, it says that they turned darkness into Light. These are the %0a%3c souls of the world of Atzilut, for the Creator created two opposite systems in the %0a%3c worlds BYA: the system of darkness and bitterness opposite the system of Light %0a%3c and sweetness. Therefore, in the Torah of the worlds BYA there is a division into %0a%3c suitable and unsuitable, pure and impure, permitted and forbidden, holy and %0a%3c unholy, whereas the Torah of the world of Atzilut, which consists wholly of the %0a%3c Creator's names, contains nothing impure whatsoever. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the sinner Laban is regarded as a holy name in the world of Atzilut, %0a%3c as well as the Pharaoh. And all the names that represent impure forces in the %0a%3c worlds BYA become corrected in the world of Atzilut, exalted and pure spiritual %0a%3c objects and forces with corresponding holy names. Therefore, the souls that %0a%3c have attained the Light of the world of Atzilut transform all darkness into Light %0a%3c and all bitterness into sweetness. In other words, the whole difference between %0a%3c the holy, pure, and good, and their opposites lies in the correction of the desire %0a%3c and in acquiring an anti-egoistic screen over the will to receive. %0a%3c %0a%3c And to the second group the voice said that they're waiting for the Creator's %0a%3c help, and He will rise (Shechina, His manifestation to the lower ones) from the %0a%3c dust (in their sensations). But those who do not wait for Him, being preoccupied %0a%3c with other aspirations, will not rise from the dust, and the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator will remain concealed from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 200 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 55. In his vision, Rabbi Chiya saw many of his friends gathering around the %0a%3c standing pillars. And he saw them being elevated to the Heavenly Assembly, %0a%3c some are elevated, while others are lowered. And above them all, he saw Matat, %0a%3c the owner of wings, approaching. %0a%3c %0a%3c As the voice was calling, Rabbi Chiya saw several souls of the righteous, %0a%3c belonging to the two groups, standing around the two pillars that were already %0a%3c present in Rabbi Shimon's assembly, and whom he had already seen ascending %0a%3c to the Heavenly Assembly. Some were ascending, and some were descending; %0a%3c moreover, this motion ensued in mutually opposite directions. %0a%3c %0a%3c This way the two groups help one another according to the calling voice, %0a%3c which instructs the first group to descend and the second to ascend. Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c saw also that due to the excitement of all these souls over their aspirations, i.e., %0a%3c the power of the two groups, Matat descended from the Heavenly Assembly to %0a%3c the assembly of Rabbi Shimon and swore an oath. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56. The angel Matat swore that he heard from behind the curtain how each %0a%3c day the Creator remembers and grieves over Malchut, cast into the dust. And %0a%3c when He remembers her, He strikes 390 firmaments, and they all tremble %0a%3c with terrible fear before Him. And the Creator sheds tears for the Shechina %0a%3c (Divinity), Malchut that has fallen to the dust. And those tears simmer like %0a%3c fire, and fall into the Great Sea. And by the power of these tears, the Ruler of %0a%3c the Sea, called Rachav, is revived, blesses the Creator's holy name, and vows to %0a%3c swallow up everything, from the first days of creation, and to absorb all within %0a%3c himself, when all the nations gather against the holy nation, and the waters %0a%3c will dry, and Israel will walk through dry land. %0a%3c %0a%3c This vow signifies that the Creator never forgets, but remembers each day that %0a%3c the Shechina lies in the dust. However, this does not refer to the entire Holy Shechina: %0a%3c this, the Creator need not vow, for it is revealed and seen by all who dwell in the %0a%3c Upper Worlds that everything He does is for the Shechina (Malchut) alone. %0a%3c %0a%3c But this refers only to Malchut de Malchut. She is the one Rabbi Chiya thinks %0a%3c about being held captive by the impure forces, completely abandoned. Hence, %0a%3c he wept: "Oh dust that consumes all!" And here, the angel Matat, who has come %0a%3c to the Assembly of Rabbi Shimon, revealed to Rabbi Chiya a great secret— that %0a%3c the Creator's rule is absolute, and He remembers Malchut de Malchut each day. %0a%3c %0a%3c A Zivug (union of the Masach-screen and the Light-pleasure) is defined as %0a%3c a stroke of Light onto the screen, a result of the desire to enter and cross the %0a%3c screen's barrier, while the screen restricts and repels it. This act of repelling is %0a%3c called the Returning (reversed) Light, as it rises from the screen from below %0a%3c upwards and clothes the coming Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 201 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This may be compared to the example of the host (Creator) offering delicious %0a%3c food (Light) to his guest (Kli), who wishes to enjoy the delicacies. However, as %0a%3c a result of the shame from being the receiver, the guest refuses to receive, and %0a%3c the screen repels the food (Light). It is as though the guest (Kli) says to the host %0a%3c (Creator) that he refuses to receive the pleasure (Light) for himself, for his own %0a%3c enjoyment. This repelling of the food (Light) forms the Returning Light, for it %0a%3c stems not just from not wanting to feel shame, as it is in our world, but from the %0a%3c spiritual Kli's desire to be like the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Returning Light is that altruistic intention, desire. This is also the %0a%3c spiritual Kli, and only within it can the Light be received; only in this intention %0a%3c can one feel the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Kli was able to repel all the pleasure coming to it, and demonstrated %0a%3c that it could meet the condition of the first restriction (to refrain from egoistic %0a%3c reception), it began to calculate how much Light it could receive for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. The Kli receives only the amount of pleasure that it is certain it can receive %0a%3c for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The delight that was received inside the Kli is referred to as the Inner Light. %0a%3c The amount of Light received inside the vessel determines the degree of similarity %0a%3c to the Creator; the Kli acts like the Creator: just as He desires to bestow pleasure %0a%3c upon the Kli, so the Kli wishes to bestow upon Him, to the extent of the Inner %0a%3c Light received. Therefore, the size of the Kli, (from Peh to Tabur, where it receives %0a%3c the Light) determines the degree of merging with the Creator. In this place, the %0a%3c Kli is merged with Him in properties and intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Kli's powers of resistance are not sufficient to receive for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, and it can only refrain from reception, the Kli is considered to be in the %0a%3c "small" state, Katnut. The Kli that was created by the Creator is the strongest. %0a%3c However, afterwards, as it begins to descend, its screen gradually weakens until %0a%3c the Kli can no longer receive for the Creator's sake. It is left with just enough %0a%3c strength to not receive for itself. This is why from this state onward there is a ban %0a%3c on reception of Light into the Kli's desires "to receive." The Kli may only use its %0a%3c GE, but not its AHP. And the boundary beyond which the Light cannot spread %0a%3c is called Parsa, the firmament. This barrier is built from Above; thus, even if the %0a%3c Kli suddenly wishes to receive the Light for itself, it will not be able to do so. %0a%3c %0a%3c The screen divides the firmament and consists of four parts: Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c Tifferet, and Malchut (HBTM), the four letters of HaVaYaH. Because Malchut %0a%3c joined with Bina and thereby corrected her egoistic properties into altruistic %0a%3c ones, the screen is located not in Malchut, but in Bina. Bina is counted as %0a%3c hundreds; therefore, the four parts HBTM equal 400. However, there is no Zivug %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 202 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (reception of Light) on Malchut de Malchut itself (after all, it is called the "closed %0a%3c gates"). This means that Malchut contains ninety Sefirot, and not 100: 9 Sefirot, %0a%3c each consisting of ten. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the screen that is called "the firmament" and that makes a Zivug %0a%3c with the Upper Light by reflecting it consists of 390 parts, for the part of Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut is lacking. The firmament is therefore said to consist of 390 firmaments, %0a%3c and on it a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made, whereas a Zivug on the dust, %0a%3c which signifies the ten parts of Malchut de Malchut, is forbidden. The impact %0a%3c between the screen and the incoming Light resembles shuddering from fear to %0a%3c receive the Light inside of oneself, beyond the limits of one's restrictions. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are five Sefirot in the Rosh (head) of a Partzuf: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Galgalta (or Metzach) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - forehead %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Eynaim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - eyes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Awznayim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - ears %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hotem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - nose %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as the secretion from one's physiological eyes is called tears, the secretion %0a%3c of the Light of Hochma from the part of the spiritual Kli called "eyes" is referred %0a%3c to as "tears." Tears constitute the part of the Light that is rejected by the Partzuf %0a%3c due to the absence of a screen on Malchut de Malchut. All the Light that comes to %0a%3c a Partzuf wishes to enter and fill it with its pleasure, even the part of the Partzuf %0a%3c that has no screen to receive with altruistic intentions. Therefore, the screen %0a%3c immediately repels this portion of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c But between the strike of the Light from Above and the resistance of the %0a%3c screen from below, tiny drops of Light seep through the screen, which, due to its %0a%3c hurry, is unable to repel them. These drops have nothing to do with the level of %0a%3c Hochma of the Partzuf, as they lack the clothing of the Returning Light. They exit %0a%3c the Partzuf Hochma and receive the name "tears." But it is nonetheless Light! %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to a state where we are filled with tears of compassion for %0a%3c another person. Indeed, all that exists in our world exists because it derives %0a%3c from its spiritual prototype, and all that transpires in this world, transpires only %0a%3c because it stems from its Upper, spiritual root. %0a%3c %0a%3c After all, the fact that the Upper Light strikes the screen, trying to break %0a%3c through its restriction, stems from its origin in the Highest Place, the Creator %0a%3c Himself, and is unrelated to the creature's desire to receive this Light within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 203 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the bounds of its altruistic capabilities. The Light stems from the world of %0a%3c Infinity, from the Creator Himself, long before the Kli appeared and wished %0a%3c to restrict itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light wishes to fill the desire to enjoy that it created, as it is said, %0a%3c "the Creator wishes to dwell in His creatures below." The Light and the Creator %0a%3c are one and the same; after all, man defines the sensation of the Creator as %0a%3c spiritual Light. And this Upper Light strives to force its way through the screen %0a%3c and enter man's desires, but the screen hurls it back. Thus, this repelled Upper %0a%3c Light becomes Returning Light, which designates man's altruistic intentions to %0a%3c bestow delight upon the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the collision with the screen, portions of the Light fall %0a%3c outside, for these tears originate from the Creator's love and compassion for %0a%3c His creation. In our world, this spiritual action results in an emission of tears %0a%3c in an individual overwhelmed with suffering and love. However, spiritual tears %0a%3c do not disappear. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is described in Song of Songs (8:6): "For love is as strong as death, %0a%3c jealousy is as cruel as hell; the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, the very flame %0a%3c of the Lord!" This is because these tears stem from the Upper One's love and %0a%3c compassion for the lower one. And just as flaming tears shed by someone in our %0a%3c world burn, so do the boiling and burning Upper tears burn like fire, like the %0a%3c very flame of the Lord! %0a%3c %0a%3c Being related to the property of Hochma, Malchut is called "sea." It is %0a%3c therefore said that the tears (Light of Hochma without first being clothed in %0a%3c Light of Hassadim) fall into the sea, Malchut. And it is written that the many %0a%3c sea waters will not extinguish the Creator's love for His creatures, expressed %0a%3c in these tears. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was said during the creation of the world: "Let the waters be gathered %0a%3c together unto one place" (Beresheet, 1:9). But the angel that governed the sea did %0a%3c not wish to swallow these waters, and was hence killed (was emptied of Light). %0a%3c Now, as the tears fall, he is revived. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that during the creation of the world, Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut itself had not undergone any kind of correction, as the Creator created %0a%3c the worlds ABYA in a special correction, called MAN de Bina or Ateret Yesod, %0a%3c and not MAN de Malchut or Malchut de Malchut. In other words, correction is %0a%3c possible only if man corrects not Malchut de Malchut itself (his essence), but, %0a%3c while completely refraining from its use (use of egoism), he acquires higher, %0a%3c altruistic desires from Bina and receives the Creator's Light in them (in Sefirot %0a%3c KHB-ZA de Malchut, in 390 Sefirot). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 204 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These higher, altruistic desires are referred to as desires of Bina or as MAN %0a%3c de Bina, and the reception of Light in them (Zivug) is made not on egoism %0a%3c (Malchut herself), but on the will to bestow, called Ateret Yesod. This Zivug is %0a%3c therefore sufficient to fill only the first nine Sefirot in Malchut, but does not %0a%3c fill Malchut herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Prophet Yeshayahu (Isaiah) writes in this regard: "Who are you with, %0a%3c partners? I started the worlds, and you are to complete them!" The correction of %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is incumbent solely upon the creatures. Hence, when the sea %0a%3c ruler was told: "Let the waters be gathered together unto one place," he objected %0a%3c and did not wish to swallow up the created waters, for due to the uncorrected %0a%3c state of Malchut de Malchut, the impure forces prevailed and ruled over him. %0a%3c And that is why he was killed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, these tears correct Malchut de Malchut, and thus revive the sea %0a%3c ruler so that he would rise from the dead, sanctify the name of the Lord, fulfill %0a%3c the Creator's will, and swallow up the primeval waters. For then, all the impure %0a%3c forces, all the evil in the world will disappear and all (desires) will gather in one %0a%3c place (property), whose name is Atzilut. This is because the world of Atxilut will %0a%3c spread from the end of the world of AK down to our world, and there will come %0a%3c the end of correction, for the worlds of BYA will return in their properties to %0a%3c the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the future, at the end of correction, after the correction of the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut, when only Malchut de Malchut, the last, tenth Sefira, remains %0a%3c to be corrected, when all the nations of the world (Malchut de Malchut) unite to %0a%3c destroy Israel (the first nine Sefirot of Malchut, the desire to correct all the ten %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut), the act of the sea ruler will be revealed in that he will swallow %0a%3c up all the primeval, evil waters, and the waters (severe restrictions) will dry up, and %0a%3c the sons of Israel (those who aspire for the Creator) will walk through dry land. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prophet Micha (Micah) says of this: "As we fled the land of Egypt, we %0a%3c saw wonders." However, this was only the beginning, for it was only in the End %0a%3c Sea (the Red Sea; the Hebrew name signifies the end of Malchut, or Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut), and only for a limited time. But, at the end of correction, death will %0a%3c disappear forever. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is how Matat explained his oath: the Creator never forgets Malchut, %0a%3c which is cast in the dust. For even though a daily Zivug with the Shechina is made %0a%3c on only 390 firmaments, on the nine Sefirot of Malchut and not on Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut itself, which remains lying in the dust, and, as it seems to us, completely %0a%3c forgotten by the Creator, nothing could be further from the truth. In truth, %0a%3c He corrects it with each Zivug, because with each Zivug, as a result of the 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 205 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c firmaments being struck, the tears fall outside. And these tears are not lost, but %0a%3c fall into the Great Sea (Malchut de Malchut), which receives from them slow, yet %0a%3c gradual corrections, even if it is the Light of Hochma without the clothing of %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim. As it becomes more and more corrected, the sea ruler is %0a%3c revived until the tears accumulate to the necessary amount for the correction of %0a%3c the entire Malchut, so that all of her intentions would be for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c This will occur when all the nations of the world unite to attack Israel. Then, %0a%3c the sea ruler will rise back to life and swallow up all the primeval waters, for %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut will receive the lacking correction, for each day the Creator %0a%3c cares for her until she, His only creation, reaches her final correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here Rabbi Chiya's delusion was revealed to him: he understood that %0a%3c nothing disappears in the dust, but, on the contrary, each day Malchut undergoes %0a%3c corrections, just as Matat swore. %0a%3c %0a%3c 57. Through all this, he heard a voice: "Clear this place, clear this place! The %0a%3c Mashiach (Messiah), the King-Redeemer is coming to the assembly of Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon," for all the righteous gathered there are the heads of groups and %0a%3c assemblies, whereas all of the assembly members ascend from this assembly %0a%3c to the Assembly of Heaven. And the Mashiach visits all these assemblies and %0a%3c seals the Torah that stems from the mouths of the righteous. And at that %0a%3c moment, the M.ashiach comes to the assembly of Rabbi Shimon, surrounded %0a%3c by the heads of all the Supernal assemblies. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the great revelation— the end of correction— concealed in the %0a%3c oath of Matat, all of the righteous present at Rabbi Shimon's Assembly were %0a%3c elevated, especially the two groups of the righteous that caused Matat to appear %0a%3c and take his oath. As a result, all of them attained Upper Degrees and reached %0a%3c the levels of "heads of assemblies," for each assembly has members and a head, %0a%3c and the difference between them is similar to the difference between VAK, GE %0a%3c of the degree or Partzuf, from GAR, the complete Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the place should be cleared for the Mashiach. After %0a%3c all, when Matat revealed the secret of the end (of correction), and specifically %0a%3c how creation will be delivered from egoism, a voice appeared and commanded %0a%3c to prepare a place for the Mashiach, the King-Redeemer, for the end of correction %0a%3c is connected to the King-Mas hiach. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, only the righteous of Rabbi Shimon's assembly, who are above all %0a%3c the heads of assemblies, merit his coming, for only those who are on the same %0a%3c spiritual level as the King-Mashiach (all those who have already corrected all of %0a%3c their other properties— the first nine Sefirot in their part of desires-Malchut— all %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 206 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the properties except for the original egoism, Malchut de Malchut) can merit %0a%3c the revelation of his face. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of the Mashiach is the Light of Yechida. And if all the members had %0a%3c not reached the level of the heads of the assemblies, the GAR of the degrees, %0a%3c i.e., corrected all that they could, they would not have merited the revelation %0a%3c of the Mashiach's face. But the heads of the Assemblies are not GAR of the low %0a%3c degrees. Rather, they represent a level so high that all the members have merited %0a%3c reaching the Heavenly Assembly of Matat. %0a%3c %0a%3c And now all the members merited becoming the heads of the Assemblies, %0a%3c wherefrom they merited an ascent to the Heavenly Assembly. Moreover, %0a%3c thanks to their corrections, they merited the Mashiach himself coming to all %0a%3c these assemblies to be adorned with their deeds in the Torah. And now all the %0a%3c members have merited reaching the level of the assemblies' heads. This is why %0a%3c the Mashiach is adorned with the Torah of the assemblies' heads. Thus, thanks %0a%3c to them, the Mashiach himself ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58. At that time, all the members stood up. Rabbi Shimon stood up, too, and %0a%3c his Light rose to the firmament. The Mashiach said unto him: "Happy are %0a%3c you, Rabbi, for your Torah has risen in 370 beams of Light, and each beam %0a%3c divides into 613 beams (properties) that ascend and bathe in the rivers of %0a%3c the holy Apharsemon (persimmon). And the Creator confirms and signs the %0a%3c Torah of your assembly, of the assembly of Chizkiyah (Hezekiah), the King of %0a%3c Judah, and the assembly of Achiyah ha Shiloni (Ahijah the Shilonite)." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Mashiach revealed himself to them and came to Rabbi Shimon's %0a%3c Assembly, all the members stood up (ascended from the level of VAK to GAR), %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon stood on the same degree as the Mashiach. And the Light rose %0a%3c to the height of the firmament. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon has attained %0a%3c the Light of the ten firmaments, the previously missing tenth firmament on %0a%3c account of the closed gates of Malchut de Malchut, and has attained the Light of %0a%3c Yechida, which he now was able to receive, as he could make a Zivug on Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut. And the Light of Yechida that shines from this Zivug is called Mashiach. %0a%3c The "sitting" level is 390, or VAK; the "standing" level is 400, or GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that his Torah gave rise to the Light of %0a%3c Yechida in Partzuf Atik, because: %0a%3c %0a%3c Units (0 - 9) are in Malchut; %0a%3c Tens (10 - 90) are in ZA; %0a%3c Hundreds (100 - 900) are in Ima; %0a%3c Thousands (1,000 - 9,000) are in Aba; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Vision of Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 207 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tens of thousands (10,000 - 90,000) are in Arich Anpin; %0a%3c And hundreds of thousands (100,000 - 900,000) are in Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since each Sefira of Atik equals 100,000, the four Sefirot of HaVaYaH (HBTM %0a%3c of Atik) total 400,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in this case, he should have said that the Torah performed the %0a%3c deed in 400,000; yet, he said that the Light emanated by Ima is not used on %0a%3c 400, but only on 370, for although the Torah had reached the zenith of the %0a%3c firmament, it still could not reach GAR of the last, Supernal Hundred. Hence, %0a%3c there are only 370, while the Upper Thirty are absent in Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies with regard to thousands— the Light of Aba does not use %0a%3c GAR of each thousand, but only VAK, i.e., 600 instead of 1,000. Instead of the %0a%3c GAR of each thousand, it uses thirteen (Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot (paths %0a%3c of) Hochma"). The number thirteen signifies Hochma of the "thirty-two Netivot %0a%3c Hochma," the weak Light of Hochma, called the holy Apharsemon. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that the Torah attained 370 Lights, and each of them divides %0a%3c into 613 beams; thus, in the 400 of Ima, thirty of the Upper Light of Hochma are %0a%3c absent, which leaves it with only 370. And each thousand lacks the Upper 400 %0a%3c (GAR of Hochma). Instead of using the thirteen paths of the holy Apharsemon, each %0a%3c thousand contains no more than 613, for all the supernal secrets are concealed in %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon's assembly. And the Creator Himself sealed them, for He ascends %0a%3c and becomes adorned with the achievements of all the righteous in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c We know from the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 99:1) that everything the prophets %0a%3c ever said refers only to the days of the Mashiach's coming, but in the future %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 64), everyone will behold the Creator themselves. For all the degrees %0a%3c and levels that refer to the days of the Mashiach will then be corrected, and all %0a%3c the secrets of the Torah will be revealed, everyone will attain complete revelation %0a%3c of the Light, of the Creator, as it is said, everyone will see with their own eyes %0a%3c (sight implies GAR de Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid, it becomes clear that there exists an opportunity to %0a%3c correct one's individual Malchut de Malchut even before all the souls achieve it in %0a%3c the future. In such a case, man reaches his individual level of attainment of 400, %0a%3c although his general level cannot be higher than 370, as in the case of everybody %0a%3c else. This is the degree that Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Chizkiyah, and Achiyah ha %0a%3c Shiloni had reached. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59. The Mashiach said: "I have come here not to confirm the Torah of your %0a%3c assembly, but only because the 'owner of wings' is on his way here. For I know %0a%3c that he shall not enter any other assembly, but only yours." Meanwhile, Rabbi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 208 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shimon told him of the oath taken by the "owner of wings." Right then %0a%3c the Mashiach trembled in awe and raised his voice, and the Heavens shook, %0a%3c and the Great Sea boiled, and the Leviathan stirred, and the entire world %0a%3c threatened to overturn. %0a%3c %0a%3c At that moment, he saw Rabbi Chiya in Rabbi Shimon's adornments. %0a%3c He asked, "Who gave man in this world the adornments, garment of %0a%3c the other world?" (garment of the other world onto the body of this world). Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon answered, "This is Rabbi Chiya, the cresset of the Torah!" He said %0a%3c to him, "Gather him and his sons (those who have left this world), and they %0a%3c shall join your Assembly." Rabbi Shimon said, "Time was granted to him, %0a%3c he was granted time" (Rabbi Chiya' s time has not yet come). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach said to Rabbi Shimon that he came not for the sake of the %0a%3c Torah, but because the "owner of wings" has come to the assembly, wishing to %0a%3c know what Matat had said. For Matat had revealed that the end of correction %0a%3c would be preceded by terrible suffering for Israel— the Heavens and the Great Sea %0a%3c would tremble, and the world would be on the verge of collapse, as predicted in %0a%3c the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 97): "All is broken." Hence, he raised his voice, wishing %0a%3c to mitigate all this upheaval. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mashiach was surprised to see Rabbi Chiya's garment (that Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c exists in a physical body of our world, in the property of this world), for if he %0a%3c had merited the appearance of Matat and his oath, he had attained the degree %0a%3c of complete correction of all his evil. And since he merited seeing the Mashiach's %0a%3c face, to receive the Light of Yechida, he had obviously completed his work in this %0a%3c world, and there is nothing left for him to do here. Hence, he should leave it %0a%3c and enter Rabbi Shimon's assembly in the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c But Rabbi Shimon persuaded Rabbi Chiya that he needs to continue %0a%3c performing new, additional corrections in this world. And both the Mashiach %0a%3c and Rabbi Shimon explained to Rabbi Chiya what else specifically he still %0a%3c needed to do in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 60. Rabbi Chiya trembled in awe when the Mashiach left, and his eyes fulfilled %0a%3c with tears. For the Mashiach left Rabbi Shimon's Assembly weeping from the %0a%3c great desire for the final correction and redemption. And Rabbi Chiya was also %0a%3c anguished from the fervent desire to reach the end of correction. Rabbi Chiya %0a%3c cried and said: "Happy is the lot of the righteous in the other world, and happy %0a%3c is the lot of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who has merited all of this." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 61. Beresheet: Rabbi Shimon opened: "Put my words in your mouth. How %0a%3c much effort should man exert in the Torah day and night, for the Creator is %0a%3c attentive to those who study it. And with every word that man attains by his %0a%3c efforts in the Torah, he builds a firmament." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator gave the righteous the power of His speech. And just as the %0a%3c Creator creates the creature by the power of His word, so the righteous create %0a%3c new Heavens by its power. This is why Rabbi Shimon opened his speech by %0a%3c explaining the words, "In the beginning, the Creator created Heaven and %0a%3c earth," as the word Barah (created) also means "closing" and "limiting." And %0a%3c we must understand why the Creator had created it in such a closed form. %0a%3c He answers, "To put the correction of Heaven and earth in the words of %0a%3c the righteous, to make them His partners— participants in the creation of %0a%3c Heaven and earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth that the Creator %0a%3c enclosed in the mouths of the righteous: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The correction of Adam's sin, the correction of the past. Even before %0a%3c the creation of Adam, the Creator had made a secret correction of Heaven and %0a%3c earth, as it is described in the beginning of the Torah, in the chapter Beresheet: %0a%3c ZON de Atzilut ascended to AVI and to AA, while Adam ascended to ZON %0a%3c and YESHSUT. As a result, Adam received the Light of NRN de Atzilut, for he %0a%3c clothed YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut, i.e., ascended to their level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam is located within the worlds BYA and he ascends together with these %0a%3c worlds. All the worlds can ascend above their permanent state or descend to %0a%3c their places with Adam inside of them. Adam's spiritual level and the Light that %0a%3c he receives are determined by his location (see page 212). %0a%3c %0a%3c 209 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 210 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c DURING ASCENT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PERMANENT STATE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT + ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Adam - Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In other sources, such as the Talmud {Bava Batra, 58:2), this is described %0a%3c as Adam's ascent to the level of the sun (ZA de Atzilut). This Light is called %0a%3c "Zihara Ilaa" (Zihara is the Aramaic word for Zohar in Hebrew or "radiant %0a%3c Light" in English). %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of his sin, Adam fell spiritually to the level of our corporeal world %0a%3c (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1). And instead of NRN de Atzilut that he used to receive %0a%3c before his fall, he now receives the Light from the worlds BYA that are below %0a%3c Parsa. And as a result of Adam's sin, Heaven (ZA) and earth (Malchut) of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut descended to the level of VAK de ZA and the point of Malchut %0a%3c respectively, as they descended below Tahur de Partzuf AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the righteous that live in this world, but already exist spiritually in %0a%3c the spiritual worlds of BYA, are entrusted with the task of correcting all that %0a%3c transpired through Adam's fault, and to return, to renew the Heavens and the %0a%3c earth (ZON de Atzilut) and elevate them to AVI and AA— ZA to AA and Malchut %0a%3c to AVI, as it was before the sin. And as a result of their work, the righteous will %0a%3c receive the Light of the world of Atzilut that the corrected Adam is entitled to, %0a%3c for they (their souls, spiritual Kelim or inner spiritual Partzuf) are his parts. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. However, even before the sin, Adam was not in the perfect state for which %0a%3c the Creator had created him. Hence, after the righteous correct the consequences %0a%3c of Adam's sin and attain NRN de Atzilut, which existed in Adam before the sin, %0a%3c new work awaits them— to receive new Upper Light that has yet to descend. In %0a%3c other words, if the first goal is to correct the sin, the second is to attain even %0a%3c more. It is called to "create new Heaven and earth," new properties of ZON, in %0a%3c which new, Higher Light can be received. %0a%3c %0a%3c This new level or degree that has never been present in any Kli is described %0a%3c as "neither hath an eye seen the Creator beside thee," and the degrees which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 211 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the righteous attach to the worlds are called "new Heaven" and "new earth," for %0a%3c they are truly new and have never before existed in reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this Heaven and earth, which the righteous correct to the level that %0a%3c preceded Adam's sin, during the creation (Beresheet), are not called new, as they've %0a%3c already existed and the Creator Himself corrected them even before Adam's sin. %0a%3c Hence, they are called renewed, and the righteous who correct them are not %0a%3c called the Creator's partners. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Encloses in their mouths" implies reception of such Upper Light that was %0a%3c neither received by Adam nor emanated from the Creator. And now, by the %0a%3c actions of the righteous, which are called partners, participants and co-creators, %0a%3c it comes out and shines in creation. Thus we see that all the righteous are %0a%3c divided into two groups: those who correct Adam's sin and those who create %0a%3c new degrees of attainment. The latter are called the Creator's partners. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is called voice and Malchut is called speech. When a righteous person %0a%3c studies the Torah and thereby raises MAN (by the voice and speech of his To rah) %0a%3c from his soul to ZON, his voice ascends to ZA and his speech ascends to Malchut. %0a%3c The voice of the Torah that ascends with MAN to ZA is called the Creator %0a%3c (Kadosh Baruch Hu). %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, each renewed word in the Torah builds a new firmament. A word %0a%3c means speech, and any speech that renews the Torah by those who study it %0a%3c ascends in the form of MAN to Malchut, who is called "word and speech." This %0a%3c creates a new firmament in the form of a screen, on which a Zivug between the %0a%3c Creator and the Shechina is made. This is what the righteous, who study the %0a%3c Torah, attain by raising MAN! %0a%3c %0a%3c However, renewal in the words of the Torah does not imply anything new %0a%3c in the voice of the Torah. For Malchut has to recreate herself for each new Zivug, %0a%3c for after each Zivug, Malchut returns to the state of virginity thanks to the MAN %0a%3c raised by the righteous, who constantly renew her properties, her Yesod— the %0a%3c Kli for the reception of Light from ZA. Hence, it is written that the Torah is %0a%3c renewed by each word, for a word (Malchut) is renewed by the speech of the %0a%3c righteous in the Torah, as, after each Zivug, the previous Kli disappears and a %0a%3c new one appears. %0a%3c %0a%3c 62. We have learned that just as the Torah is renewed by one's mouth, that %0a%3c renewal ascends and appears before the Creator. And the Creator accepts this %0a%3c wisdom, kisses it, and adorns it with seventy adornments. And the renewed %0a%3c wisdom itself ascends and settles on the head of the righteous that revive the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 212 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c worlds, and then flies, soaring through 70,000 worlds, until it ascends to Atik, %0a%3c the Sefira Keter. And all that exists in Atik is concealed, Supernal wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a person raises MAN from his Torah, this word, which is Nukva de %0a%3c ZA, ascends and connects to the Creator in a Zivug with Him. The Creator takes %0a%3c this word, kisses, and adorns it, and these are the two types of Zivugim (plural %0a%3c for Zivug) in ZON: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Zivug de Neshikin (kisses); %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Zivug de Yesodot (bases/ foundations). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Zivug consists of two Zivugim, for a Zivug on Ohr Hochma must clothe %0a%3c itself into the Partzuf (garment) of Ohr Hassadim. Therefore, a preliminary Zivug %0a%3c must be made on Ohr Hassadim, whose role is to become a garment for Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. This is why each Zivug consists of two Zivugim: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Zivug on the degree of Hochma, called Zivug de Neshikin, because it %0a%3c stands at the Peh de Rosh of the Partzuf, at the level of Rosh and GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Zivug on the degree of Hassadim, called Zivug de Yesodot, because it %0a%3c takes place at the level of the bodies of the Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that the Creator took Nukva in this word and kissed her, %0a%3c i.e., made a Zivug de Neshikin at the level of GAR, and then adorned her, i.e., %0a%3c made a Zivug de Yesodot at the level of Hassadim. As a result, Ohr Hochma clothed %0a%3c in Ohr Hassadim, and Nukva received the complete Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c IN SEVENTY ADORNMENTS: the complete Light of Nuba is called %0a%3c "seventy adornments," because Malchut is the seventh day, and when she receives %0a%3c from ZA, her Sefirot become tens, just as the Sefirot of ZA; this turns Malchut into %0a%3c 7 x 10 = 70. Mochin (wisdom), Ohr Hochma is called Atara (adornment or crown). %0a%3c Hence, what she receives is called "seventy adornments." After Malchut receives %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim, with the help of the MAN of the righteous, she becomes %0a%3c fit to receive the Upper Light of Hochma, the seventy adornments. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was said above, there are two kinds of renewal of Heaven and earth (ZON): %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. When everything returns to the state preceding Adam's sin. In that %0a%3c instance, Malchut is called the "word of the Torah" ( VAK), where the %0a%3c Torah is ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. When Heaven and earth are created with a new Light, which even Adam %0a%3c did not attain prior to his sin. And this attainable word is called GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written (Talmud, Berachot, 7:1) that the righteous sit with adornments %0a%3c on their heads, for Malchut ascended to adorn the head of the righteous (ZA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 213 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in his Yesod, called Chai Qlamim (reviver of worlds), or, rather, in his Ateret %0a%3c Yesod-the place of circumcision. And this transpires thanks to the MAN raised %0a%3c by the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light of Adam's Zihara %0a%3c llaa, just as Rabbi Shimon and his friends have already attained it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma is called Ohr Haya. Since ZA desires only Hassadim, he can %0a%3c receive Ohr Haya only with the help of his Nukva, Malchut. It turns out that %0a%3c ZA lives, i.e., receives Ohr Haya, only if he is in a Zivug with Nukva, called Olam %0a%3c (world). That is how the name Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds) originated. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Nukva, the adornment on his head, becomes important (Keter - crown) %0a%3c because ZA receives this Light only thanks to his Malchut. Although Malchut was %0a%3c born from ZA, since it is Malchut and no other that evokes, makes reception of %0a%3c the Light of Life possible, ZA calls her his mother. Indeed, ZA receives Ohr Ha^a %0a%3c (the Light of Life) from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that Malchut flies and soars in 70,000 worlds, and %0a%3c after her Zivug with ZA on his Atara (adornment on his head), she ascends even %0a%3c higher, to AA, where the seven Sefirot of Malchut, called 70,000 worlds, become %0a%3c corrected, as one Sefira of ZA equals 10,000. After that, Malchut ascends higher %0a%3c still— to Atik. And all of these ascents of ZON to Atilc transpire thanks to the %0a%3c efforts made by the righteous that raise MAN: a Zivug on Atara elevates ZON to %0a%3c AVI, from which they ascend to AA (70,000 worlds), and from there to Atik, the %0a%3c highest possible point of ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that all the words of Atik 's Supernal wisdom are locked, %0a%3c since Malchut receives the Upper Light upon ascending to Atik, and each degree %0a%3c that she receives from Atik is called "concealed," "Supernal wisdom," i.e., GAR %0a%3c de Hochma. This is because words of wisdom signify the degree of Hochma, and %0a%3c the words "concealed," "secret," and "Supernal" refer to GAR. Also, they are %0a%3c revealed only to those who attain the level of Atik, but not below, as Tzimtzum %0a%3c Bet (the second restriction) already exists in AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63. And when this hidden wisdom, which is renewed here in this world, %0a%3c ascends, she joins Atik, ascends and descends, enters 18 worlds, where no %0a%3c eye has seen the Creator besides you. They emerge from there and appear %0a%3c before Atik, complete and perfect. Meanwhile, Atik tests her and finds her %0a%3c most desirable above all else. He then takes her and adorns her with 370,000 %0a%3c adornments. And she, the renewed Torah, ascends and descends, and is %0a%3c transformed into a firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the ascent of Malchut to Atik, she joins the Zivug that transpires %0a%3c there, and creates Ohr Hoxer (Returning Light) by accepting Ohr Yashar (Direct %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 214 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Light) at the level of Atik's properties. The ascent of Malchut means that Malchut %0a%3c elevates Ohr Hozer from herself upwards. Malchut's descent means that she sends %0a%3c Ohr Yashar from Above downwards. And then Malchut receives the hidden, %0a%3c secret, and Supernal wisdom. The word "joins" signifies her contact with the %0a%3c Ohr Hozer and the Ohr Yashar within Atik itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Zivug is made in Atik on its Yesod, but not on Malchut, since Malchut de %0a%3c Atik is concealed until the end of correction. Like Yesod de ZA during its ascent %0a%3c to AVI, this Yesod is called Chai Olamim. The difference between them is that %0a%3c Yesod de Atik is called "No one else but you can see the Creator," for a Zivug on %0a%3c Yesod elevates Ohr Hozer and clothes Ohr Yashar with it. This screen is defined %0a%3c in AVI, below Atik, as wings that block the Upper Light. This shows that the %0a%3c screen possesses a force of restriction, law, judgment. This is why Ohr Hozer is %0a%3c also called "the Light of Restriction." Thus, Ohr Hozer exists in AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Conversely, the screen in Yesod de Atik, of which it is said that there "the %0a%3c Creator no longer hides from you" (Yeshayahu, 30:20), while it does raise Ohr %0a%3c Hozer, it does not conceal the Creator thereby, does not have the properties of %0a%3c wings. This is the reason why it is called Chai Olamim (reviver of worlds). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, it remains concealed until man attains that level himself, as is %0a%3c written: "Only your eyes shall see the Creator." There are no wings or anything %0a%3c else there that conceal Him from outsiders' eyes, for no restrictions are imposed %0a%3c and everything is revealed. And neither are there any restrictions in Ohr Hozer, %0a%3c but only mercy and benevolence, as in Ohr Yashar. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name Chai Olamim implies that a Zivug is made not on ten Sefirot of %0a%3c Ohr Yashar from Above downwards and ten Sefirot of Ohr Hozer from below %0a%3c upwards, and not on the whole of the twenty Sefirot, i.e., not on Malchut herself, %0a%3c but on Yesod de Malchut. In this instance, there are nine Sefirot of Ohr Yashar %0a%3c and nine Sefirot of Ohr Hozer, as Yesod is the ninth Sefira: 9 + 9= 18= 10 + 8 = %0a%3c Yod + Chet, which is pronounced in reverse order as Chet-Yod (Chai), for this is %0a%3c the Returning Light. The word "life" (Chaim) is derived from the word "alive" %0a%3c (Chai), for he who is able to make a Zivug on Yesod receives the Upper Light of %0a%3c life, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tremendous Upper Light manifests in Atik as a result of this Zivug. This %0a%3c is because all the worlds and all that inhabit them join Nukva, and together %0a%3c they attain true perfection, the level for which they were initially conceived and %0a%3c created by the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that word flies in the firmament, which signifies the creation %0a%3c of Ohr Hozer from below upwards, which leads to Ohr Yashar descending from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 215 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Creator, from Above downwards. And the clothing of Ohr Hozer on Ohr %0a%3c Yashar creates a firmament, because the screen that appears in Malchut for the %0a%3c creation of Ohr Hozer comes as a result of the good deeds of the righteous, their %0a%3c MAN (requests for spiritual ascent) aimed at pleasing the Creator. So then, after %0a%3c this screen makes a Zivug with the Upper Light, it becomes a firmament, with %0a%3c the help of which, the righteous attain the full height of the degree on which %0a%3c they have now made a Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because when this degree descends to the righteous through the %0a%3c firmament, it clothes in Ohr Hozer (garment of this firmament), which, together %0a%3c with the Ohr Yashar clothed within it, turn over and they descend below the %0a%3c screen (firmament) and thereby become attainable by the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those righteous that have achieved such perfection that they can raise %0a%3c MAN to such exalted Zivug have already rid themselves of egoism completely %0a%3c and have no desire to receive anything for themselves. Instead, they raise their %0a%3c MAN (request) with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator. Therefore, by %0a%3c their corrections (MAN), they correct the screen in Malchut, and, by creating %0a%3c Ohr Hozer in her, which ascends from the screen of Malchut upwards, make her %0a%3c capable of a great Zivug. This is because all that ascends is altruism, bestowal, %0a%3c repelling, and rejecting reception for oneself and egoistic pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then there is a Zivug with the Upper Light, and the Upper Light clothes %0a%3c in the ascending Returning Light. This descending Upper Light clothes into %0a%3c the Returning Light and enters into the righteous that have raised MAN. The %0a%3c expression "from below upwards" implies the repelling of Light by a person, and %0a%3c "from Above downwards" designates a person's reception. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the Upper Light comes to man through a firmament, it takes %0a%3c the Light reflected from the firmament as its garment, and one receives the %0a%3c Upper Light clothed in Returning Light. This means that, even after one already %0a%3c receives the spiritual information of the entire degree, he delights in the Upper %0a%3c Light that descends to him only to the extent in which he can please the Creator %0a%3c thereby, i.e., to the extent of his strength, the magnitude of his screen, and the %0a%3c amount of Returning Light that clothes the Direct Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such reception of the Upper Light (only to the extent of the magnitude of %0a%3c Ohr Hozer created by man) is called the reception for the Creator's sake. And %0a%3c wherever one cannot find a way to bestow upon the Creator, he does not receive. %0a%3c Hence, his reception is clothed in bestowal: the Upper Direct Light is clothed in %0a%3c Returning Light, meaning the lower one receives only the clothed Upper Light %0a%3c from the Upper One, i.e., only through the firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 216 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 64. And thus, every deed creates firmaments that appear before Atik, and he %0a%3c calls them "new Heavens" or, rather, "renewed firmaments," concealed by %0a%3c Supernal wisdom. And all the other parts of the Torah that are not renewed %0a%3c by means of Supernal wisdom appear before the Creator, ascend and become %0a%3c "the lands of life" (Artzot HaChaim). They then descend and adorn one land. %0a%3c And it becomes renewed, and a new land comes into being from all that was %0a%3c renewed in the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The righteous are constantly raising newer and newer MAN, and thus %0a%3c receive newer and newer degrees of attainments from Atik, with the help of the %0a%3c firmaments created by the Upper Zivug. From these firmaments emerge new %0a%3c Heavens, which are renewed in the degrees of Atik. These exalted attainments %0a%3c of the righteous are therefore called the hidden secrets of Supernal wisdom, for %0a%3c they descend clothed in the garments received from the firmaments. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "earth" and Bina is called "the lands of life" (Artzot %0a%3c HaChaim). When Malchut attains all the degrees of Bina, she acquires the name %0a%3c "the land of life." Malchut is also called the "new land," for she exchanges her %0a%3c own properties for those of Bina. And everything that was previously Malchut %0a%3c now becomes Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written that in the future, BON will become SAG, and MA %0a%3c will become AB, for Heaven is ZA that now ascended to the degree of Atik (AB %0a%3c or Hochma). The earth, Nukva de ZA, Malchut, became SAG, Bina. Hence, the %0a%3c new land and the new Heavens are Malchut and ZA that became SAG and AB, %0a%3c Atik and AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 65. It is written, "When the new land and the new Heavens, which I make." %0a%3c It is not written, "I have made," in past tense, but rather "I make," in present %0a%3c tense, for they are constantly made from the renewal and secrets of the Torah. %0a%3c And it is written of this: "And I shall place it in your mouth, and in the %0a%3c shadow of your hands' garments, that I may take the Heavens, and lay the %0a%3c foundations of the land" (Yeshayahu, 51:16). It is simply said "Heavens," for %0a%3c it implies the Heavens renewed by the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything that is described in the Torah is written in the present tense, %0a%3c as there is no time in the spiritual; everything is written with regard to the one %0a%3c /ho attains the Torah at that given moment. This is what The Zohar wants %0a%3c ess here: the matter concerns man's constant work on himself, on his %0a%3c %0a%3c the righteous that have already attained the Upper Light continue cr %0a%3c ver and newer Heavens and lands, as is written, "The righteous ascend frc %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 217 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 66. Rabbi Elazar said, "What is the meaning of 'in the shadow of your hands' %0a%3c garments?'". He answered, when the Torah was passed to Moshe, tens of %0a%3c thousands of Supernal angels appeared so as to raise him with the flames of %0a%3c their mouths, but the Creator protected him. So now, when the renewal in %0a%3c the Torah ascends and appears before the Creator, He protects it and shelters %0a%3c the one who performed it, so as to prevent the angels from finding out and %0a%3c envying him, until new Heaven and earth are made out of this renewal in %0a%3c the Torah. Hence, it is said, "To take the Heavens and lay the foundations of %0a%3c the land from the shadow of your hands' garments." It follows that all that is %0a%3c concealed from the eyes achieves a supernal result. This is why it is said, "In %0a%3c the shadow of your hands' garments." Yet, why should it be concealed from %0a%3c the eyes for the sake of a supernal result? Hence, it is immediately said, "So %0a%3c that I may take the Heavens and lay the foundations of the land." As we have %0a%3c learned— so that new Heavens and earth will appear out of this concealment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase "In the shadow of your hands' garments" alludes to Ohr Hozer, %0a%3c the garment that stems from the firmament, clothing and covering of the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Like a shadow, this garment conceals Hochma from outsiders' eyes, so %0a%3c they do not know what is inside. Why are High Degrees concealed from angels? %0a%3c So they would not envy man, for when the angels, which are made of a very light %0a%3c material (without egoism), look at one who is righteous and see his negative %0a%3c properties, they envy him for the High Degree that he has achieved. They then %0a%3c begin slandering that righteous, the properties that they discover in him. This %0a%3c brings harm to the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when a degree clothes into the garment of a firmament (Ohr %0a%3c Hozer), this garment measures the degree itself, its magnitude, to prevent man %0a%3c from receiving more than his intention for the Creator's sake allows, i.e., only %0a%3c to the extent of Ohr Hozer. Thus, he is protected from the angels' envy and from %0a%3c their ability to harm his spiritual condition, for he becomes equal to them in his %0a%3c properties: his Returning Light makes him equal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Like everything else that fills the worlds, Melachim (angels) are man's %0a%3c inner properties and forces. In order to avoid harming himself by wishing to %0a%3c attain Higher Degrees before he has acquired Ohr Hozer, these degrees must %0a%3c be concealed. However, in addition to Ohr Hozer, one should exercise caution %0a%3c against his desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c This explains the rule: "The eye sees and the heart covets," and man would %0a%3c not be able to protect his intention, to keep it for the Creator's sake alone, and %0a%3c would desire to receive for himself. However, once clothed in the garment of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 218 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the firmament, he can be certain that he will not receive above his intention to %0a%3c receive for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c examine how a desire is conceived m man. %0a%3c something for the first time, not yet knowing what he is going to see. It is as %0a%3c if an object accidentally falls into his field of vision. Naturally, no ban can be %0a%3c imposed on it, as this occurrence is not dependent on man; thus, it is neither %0a%3c rewarded nor punished. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when looking at it for the second time— here, man already has free- %0a%3c dom of choice. And if the second look is going to result in the desire to receive %0a%3c pleasure, it is forbidden. If man cannot restrain himself, and looks for the second %0a%3c time, his eyes send a signal to his heart, and the heart begins to desire. Thus, man %0a%3c has the power to decide whether or not to allow the desire to be born within hi %0a%3c This is the meaning of the phrase: "The eye sees and the heart covets." %0a%3c %0a%3c 67. He said to these gates and to the words that were set one upon the other in %0a%3c the renewed Torah: "Who are you with? You are my partners. Just as I make %0a%3c the Heavens and the earth with My words, as it is written, 'By the Creator's %0a%3c word were the Heavens made,' so you create new Heavens and earth by your %0a%3c labor in the Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c The properties of reception are called "gates," because, like open gates, they %0a%3c are always ready to receive. "Words" are the properties of bestowal, of raising %0a%3c MAN to the Creator. The phrase "Set one upon the other" signifies one clothing %0a%3c the other, and so occurs reception for the sake of bestowal. %0a%3c %0a%3c 68. However, if one were to claim that the renovation of the Torah by one %0a%3c who does not even know what he is saying creates a firmament, then look %0a%3c at one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah: since he renews the %0a%3c Torah without having sufficient knowledge, all that he renews ascends, and %0a%3c the reverse side of man (male part of the impure force), and the false tongue %0a%3c (from Nukva of the impure force, called Tehom Raba— great abyss) comes %0a%3c toward him. This reversed man skips 500 Parsaot (measures of distance) to %0a%3c receive this renewal of the Torah, takes it and makes a false firmament out of %0a%3c it, called Tohu (abyss). %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the righteous raise MAN to please the Creator. This %0a%3c is called the "words of the Torah," for the words are renewed as a result of the %0a%3c Upper Zivug, and ZON receive a new Light from this Zivug, to the extent that %0a%3c they come to merit the renewal of Heaven and earth by their actions. They %0a%3c thereby become the Creator's partners— fellow workers, for, just like Him, they %0a%3c renew Heaven and earth with their words. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 219 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although one who is not familiar with the secrets of the Torah (the ways of %0a%3c the Creator) so as to know how to protect himself and to not harm the Higher %0a%3c Degrees tells himself that his intention is for the exalted goal, he deludes himself, %0a%3c for he does not know that which his soul surely knows— that his intentions are %0a%3c for himself. Terrible punishment awaits him, for he allows the impure forces to %0a%3c destroy those who labor in the Torah. The Zohar explains: if one does not know %0a%3c the exact meanings of the words, i.e., if he raises MAN to the great Zivug without %0a%3c a thorough understanding of all the intricate details of the act, the reverse man %0a%3c and the false tongue capture his word. %0a%3c %0a%3c Klipot (one's impure forces) also consist of male and female parts. The male %0a%3c part is called "fruitless return," and the female part is called "falsehood." The %0a%3c male part of the Klipa is not as bad as the female part. And when it is by itself, %0a%3c it does not prompt one to lie by the Creator's name; on the contrary, goodness %0a%3c strikes his eye, yet the eye itself is evil. And he who falls into the hands of the male %0a%3c impure force uses the Creator's name in vain, for he detaches himself from the %0a%3c Creator and receives no Light from Him, i.e., he utters words and seemingly acts, %0a%3c but fruitlessly, for these actions are not the screen's interaction with the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the sages said: "The Creator says of all who is proud: He and I cannot %0a%3c be together" (Talmud, Suta, 5: 1), for his intentions are to receive everything for %0a%3c himself, for his own benefit, for his pride and vanity, as the sensation of one's %0a%3c "I" is the greatest manifestation of pride. Hence, man falls under the power of %0a%3c the evil eye. Consequently, the MAN that he raises receives no response from %0a%3c Above, and he utters the Creator's name in vain. Therefore, the male part of the %0a%3c impure force is called empty, fruitless, false, vain, unsuccessful, and futile, for %0a%3c the Creator cannot unite with him due to the dissimilarity of their properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c If, however, one feels not his similarity to the Creator, but rather his %0a%3c oppositeness in properties from Him, and perceives himself as the most evil of %0a%3c all, he can then lower himself before the Creator, suppress all of his properties %0a%3c out of hatred for them, and the Creator Himself will perform the remaining part %0a%3c of his correction. However, one who is proud not only fails to understand the %0a%3c extent of his remoteness from the Creator, he actually believes that he is entitled %0a%3c to receive more than others, and that the Creator owes him something. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva de Klipa is called "falsehood." After one falls into the net of the male %0a%3c part of the impure force, the latter makes a Zivug with its Nukva (impure, bitter, %0a%3c and evil force), which, as a result of its connection to the male part, falsifies the %0a%3c Creator's name, descends and instigates man, and then ascends, complaints %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 220 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c against him, and takes his soul. However holy this soul was, Nukva de Klipa grabs %0a%3c all of it for itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Naturally, this refers to one who works on himself and advances spiritually, %0a%3c for whom working for the Creator's sake is his life's calling. Yet, he may %0a%3c occasionally fail to observe precisely all the restrictions, and thus find himself %0a%3c in such states. An ordinary person, however, who neither works on himself %0a%3c nor studies Kabbalah, is obviously entirely unrelated to either pure or impure %0a%3c spiritual forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c For example, the male impure force says that one must study the Torah, but %0a%3c then steals the results of his work for itself. As a result, man loses interest in his %0a%3c studies, and must once more consolidate himself in his efforts and advancement. %0a%3c And although he attains the Creator and the revelation of Light to a certain %0a%3c degree, it is nonetheless fruitless, for all of his attainments vanish from him, and %0a%3c he gains nothing from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Torah refers to it as the "reverse man," for initially he ate %0a%3c and drank and said "Go," i.e., raise MAN to the Creator and receive the Light %0a%3c for the sake of the exalted goal, but not for yourself. Thus, it pretends that it %0a%3c is not the impure force, but its opposite. However, due to its property called %0a%3c "fruitless return," it then makes a Zivug with its Nukva (the great abyss), which %0a%3c steals man's soul and destroys him with its falsehood, and man is left without %0a%3c even the slightest part of his soul that is holy and pure! %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that he skips through 500 Parsaot: initially, ZON of %0a%3c the impure forces have only VAfC in ZA and a point in Malchut. Consequently, %0a%3c they can only be equal to ZON de Atzilut in their Katnut (small state), when %0a%3c they are also VAK and a point, and have neither the power nor the place to %0a%3c connect to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, the male impure %0a%3c force is given the opportunity to skip through ZAT de Bina, which sustain the pure %0a%3c and holy ZON. ZON contain Sefirot HGT NH (Netzah-Hod) = 5x 100 = 500, since %0a%3c a Sefira in Bina equals 100. And this occurs thanks to the MAN raised by one who %0a%3c is uncertain of his intentions (whether or not he acts for the Creator's sake). %0a%3c %0a%3c The "reverse man" then makes a Zivug with his Nukva on this false MAN, %0a%3c and receives the Upper Light for the construction of his Partzuf, much like the %0a%3c spiritually pure Heavens that were created on the pure MAN. Also, the new %0a%3c Heavens created on the impure MAN are called "reverse," "empty." And since the %0a%3c impure Malchut took part in this, these Heavens are called Tohu (abyss/ chaos). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is Your Partner? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 221 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 69. And this reverse man then flies across the empty firmament, traversing %0a%3c 6,000 Parsaot in one bound. And as soon as this empty firmament stops, %0a%3c an impure woman emerges at once, seizes onto this empty firmament, and %0a%3c partakes in it. She leaves it and slays hundreds of thousands, for as long as she %0a%3c remains in this firmament, she has the authority and power to fly and traverse %0a%3c the whole world in an instant. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that stems from the empty firmament stems from the impure force, which %0a%3c is correspondingly opposite the Supernal, holy wisdom of Ohr Hochma. The %0a%3c Sefira Hochma equals 1,000, and so it is written that it flies across the firmament %0a%3c in 6,000 = six Sefirot HGT NHY of Partzuf Hochma, each of which equals 1,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the new heavens of the impure male part, called the "empty heavens," %0a%3c were completed, the power of its female half, Nulcva ("the great abyss"), was %0a%3c revealed. Her force attacked the firmament with falsehood by the Creator's %0a%3c name; she soared through the sky, and the heavens were then called Tohu. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Nukva of the impure forces partakes in this firmament, she becomes %0a%3c stronger and grows even more than the male level of the impure part. This is %0a%3c because the male impure part reaches up to VAK of Hochma, which equals 6,000 %0a%3c Parsaot, whereas Nukva grows to the full ten Sefirot, i.e., the entire world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, she is immensely powerful and can destroy many, for, as Rashi %0a%3c says, "The Creator created one opposite the other." And just as new, Holy %0a%3c Heavens and lands are created thanks to the MAN raised by the righteous, new, %0a%3c impure heavens and lands are created through the MAN raised by those who do %0a%3c not know exactly how one should work for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 70. It is written of it: "Do not facilitate fruitless transgression." Transgression %0a%3c is related to the male part, and is as heavy as wagon shafts. What is this %0a%3c transgression? It is the impure Nukva. With reins she draws the male impure %0a%3c part to fruitlessness. And then, as a result, a transgression is committed, as %0a%3c the male part draws itself towards this Nukva, who grows strong and flies off %0a%3c to slay people. And many does she slay. And who is it that caused all this? It %0a%3c is those that study the Torah, but do not attain Ohrah and Morah (Light and %0a%3c bestowal). May the Creator be merciful to them! %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned above, the male impure part is not as evil as the %0a%3c female part. This is so because it makes itself similar to the holy part of the %0a%3c creature; hence, it is called fruitless. However, due to this similarity, it has great %0a%3c power to ensnare man, as, for example, just as the sages do, it encourages people %0a%3c to study the Torah. Yet, its goals are different from that of the Creator; it wants %0a%3c to receive wisdom (Hochma), and not to become altruistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 222 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And after one is caught in its toils, the male impure force makes a Zivug %0a%3c with its impure Nukva, and, like heavy wagon shafts, they pull man into an abyss %0a%3c so great and dark that he doesn't even realize that he is in darkness. On the %0a%3c contrary, he considers himself wise and righteous. The male part only catches %0a%3c man, binds him, and then brings him to the impure Nukva and casts him at her %0a%3c feet. Only then does he falter, falls into the great abyss and perishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c 71. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "I beg of you not to utter any discernments %0a%3c from the Torah, no matter what you may hear from the Great Tree of Truth, %0a%3c so that you would not assist the impure Nukva in slaying multitudes of people %0a%3c for naught." They all opened and mouthed: "Save us, O Merciful One! Save %0a%3c us, O Merciful One!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon said that if you have attained the discernment yourselves, %0a%3c then you are allowed, but if not, you must listen to the Great Tree (the great %0a%3c learned sage, whose wisdom and purity can be trusted) to learn how to work %0a%3c for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 72. Come and see, the Creator created the world by the Torah. And He looked %0a%3c into the Torah not once, not twice, not thrice, and not four times. Only after %0a%3c that did He create the world. This should show people how not to err. %0a%3c %0a%3c 73. Opposite these four times, the Creator saw, counted, prepared, and %0a%3c investigated what He had created. It is therefore written, "Beresheet (In %0a%3c the beginning) Barah (created) Elokim (the Creator) Et (the)"— four words, %0a%3c corresponding to the four above. And then, it is written: "Heaven"— opposite %0a%3c all four words, for the Creator looked into the Torah before He began to %0a%3c manifest His thought into reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four words signify four time periods or four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M. "Saw" %0a%3c designates Hochma, "counted"— Bina, "prepared"— ZA, and "investigated"— %0a%3c Malchut. After these four, the Creator created what He created. %0a%3c %0a%3c We find the same in the Torah: Beresheet is Hochma, Barah is Bina, Elokim is %0a%3c ZA, and Et (the) is Malchut, which includes everything from Aleph to Tav— all the %0a%3c letters and all the properties. Hence, she is designated in the Torah by the word %0a%3c Et = Aleph-Tav (from the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph, to the last, %0a%3c Tav). And after these four, He created the Heavens and the earth, i.e., revealed %0a%3c the next, lower degree, below Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 74. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, was on his way to visit his father- %0a%3c in-law, Rabbi Yosi, the son of Lakunya, and Rabbi Aba accompanied him. A %0a%3c man followed behind them, driving their donkeys. Rabbi Aba said, "Let us %0a%3c open the gates of the Torah, as it is time to correct our path." %0a%3c %0a%3c In Aramaic, the language in which The Zohar was written, "driver" means %0a%3c "one who pricks." This is because the donkey driver's function amounts to %0a%3c forcing the donkeys to move by pricking them with the edge of his stick. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "It is written: My Sabbaths you are to %0a%3c observe." Let us see: the Creator created the world in six days. And each day %0a%3c would reveal His deeds, and gave strength to that day. When did He reveal %0a%3c His deeds and give them strength? On the fourth day of creation, for the first %0a%3c three days were concealed completely, and would not be revealed. The fourth %0a%3c day arrived, and He revealed the deeds and forces of all the days. %0a%3c %0a%3c The phrase "He gave that day strength" means that He gave everything to %0a%3c the day of Shabbat. For the six days are Sefirot HGT NHY that reveal on Shabbat %0a%3c (Malchut) the work and the forces that were carried out during these days. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if the deeds of all the days are concealed, and only reveal at their end, %0a%3c on Shabbat, then why is it written that they are revealed on the fourth day of %0a%3c creation? The thing is that Malchut is called both the fourth and the seventh days: %0a%3c she is fourth with regard to the first three Sefirot HGT, called the "Patriarchs" %0a%3c (Hesed is Avraham, Gevura is Yitzchak, and Tifferet is Yaakov), and seventh with %0a%3c regard to the six Sefirot, after three additional Sefirot, called the "Sons": Netzah is %0a%3c Moshe, Hod is Aaron, and Yesod is Yosef. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut herself is King David— the day of Sbabbat. Malchut grows and gradually %0a%3c accumulates her corrections in two principal stages, called Ibur (conception). %0a%3c The first three days correspond to Ibur Aleph (the first conception), and the %0a%3c %0a%3c 223 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 224 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c second three days correspond to Ibur Bet (the second conception, Gadlut, the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, Malchut is gradually created from Sefirot HGT of ZA in three %0a%3c days, and forms on the fourth day as the Sefira Net^ah de ZA. Hence, at this stage in %0a%3c her growth, Malchut is referred to as fourth from the Patriarchs. And then Shabbat %0a%3c comes to our land (Malchut is called both land/ earth and Shabbat). The state that %0a%3c Malchut achieves as a result of her growth from Sefirot NHY of ZA is called Shabbat %0a%3c on earth. And this state she attains as the seventh Sefira from all the Sefirot of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first three days are not revealed in Malchut, for as long as a Partzuf %0a%3c lacks Malchut, it is defined as concealed or secret. The weekdays are defined so. %0a%3c And when Malchut completely attains the degree where she stands, she thereby %0a%3c attains herself. This state is defined as Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if Malchut receives from the six Sefirot de ZA, shouldn't they (the six %0a%3c weekdays) be more important than Malchut-Shabbat (inferior Sefira with regard %0a%3c to those she receives from)? %0a%3c %0a%3c The truth is that all the weekdays constitute individual degrees of correction %0a%3c (weekdays' work) that are devoid of Malchut. Hence, they are called "weekdays," %0a%3c for a Partzuf without Malchut is considered a closed degree, unable to receive %0a%3c Light, and is therefore deprived of holiness. After all, in the absence of Malchut, %0a%3c there is no GAR of the Light, Ohr Hochma. And only when Malchut is revealed %0a%3c in the Partzuf (signifying the arrival of Shabbat) is the holiness of the ENTIRE %0a%3c degree revealed; ENTIRE, because all six days receive what they have earned, %0a%3c and the Light shines in all the weekdays thanks to them alone. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the first three days of creation HGT emerged before the emergence %0a%3c of Malchut, these three Sefirot were devoid of Light, i.e., they were concealed. %0a%3c And when Malchut appeared, the fourth day arrived, and the importance and %0a%3c holiness of all four days manifested, for Malchut complements the entire degree, %0a%3c and the perfection of creation becomes revealed thanks to her. In the language %0a%3c of Kabbalah, this is described in the following way: all six days of creation are %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, and Shabbat is Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma is present on weekdays, %0a%3c but cannot shine for lack of Ohr Hassadim, and when Ohr Hassadim arrives on %0a%3c Shabbat, all the Ohr Hochma shines thanks to this Ohr Hassadim of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 76. There is fire, water and air— HQT — the three first days of creation. %0a%3c Although they are the initial Supernal foundations of all that will follow, %0a%3c their actions are not revealed until the earth, meaning Malchut, reveals them. %0a%3c Only then does the work of each of the Supernal foundations reveal itself. %0a%3c Hence, the power of the first three days is revealed only on the fourth. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 225 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 77. However, the third day may be better described as one that reveals the %0a%3c creation of the first three days, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING %0a%3c FORTH GRASS. That is to say, the revelation of the earth's (Malchut's) deeds %0a%3c already took place on the third day. Yet, although it was written on the third %0a%3c day, Tifferet, it was actually the fourth day, Malchut. Malchut joined the %0a%3c third day, for Tifferet and Malchut are inseparable. And then the fourth day %0a%3c revealed its deeds— to elucidate the work of each and every one of HQT, for %0a%3c the fourth day is the "fourth leg" of the Supernal Throne (the Sefira Bind), %0a%3c whose four legs are HQTM (Hesed, Qevura, Tifferet, and Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut reveals the holiness and spiritual power of the three days. Therefore, %0a%3c Malchut ascended and joined the third day, so as to reveal by the unity of these %0a%3c three days (three lines) their exalted spiritual essence. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that the deed is revealed on the fourth day, for Malchut %0a%3c alone completes their revelation at the conclusion of the three days. And %0a%3c afterwards, three more days emerge, which are NHY. After the revelation of %0a%3c the holiness of the first three days, HGT, called the "Patriarchs," which are the %0a%3c foundation of ZA, ZA enters them (his main part is manifested), and the time %0a%3c comes for the Sons (NHY, the last three of the six days of creation) to be born. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that ZA is defined as the fourth leg of the throne %0a%3c of Bina, and the throne remains imperfect and incomplete until its fourth leg %0a%3c (foundation) manifests. Indeed, ZA is incomplete until Malchut manifests within %0a%3c him, i.e., until the fourth day arrives. And only after the emergence of Malchut %0a%3c can ZA father the Sons— the three final days of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78. All of the actions of all the Sefirot, both on the first three days of creation, %0a%3c HQT, and on the last three, NHY, are dependent on the day of Shabbat, %0a%3c Malchut, QAR of the entire degree of ZA and its perfection. Hence, it is %0a%3c written, AND THE CREATOR RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY, %0a%3c SHABBAT. This refers to the fourth leg of the throne, as the seventh and the %0a%3c fourth days are both Malchut. Only the fourth day is Malchut that includes %0a%3c the Sefira Tifferet of ZA, from his chest upwards. Also, the seventh day is %0a%3c Malchut of the entire ZA, and they merge together face to face in a Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the first three days, HGT, end with the fourth day (the result of %0a%3c their actions), they nonetheless remain not entirely complete; their perfection %0a%3c manifests only on Shabbat, together with the last three days, NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that Sbabbat is the fourth leg of the throne, even %0a%3c though it is the seventh day, for, although it emerges after the Sons, it also %0a%3c completes the deeds of the Patriarchs, as the first three days did not complete %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 226 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their corrections on the fourth day, and a seventh day, Shabbat, is needed to %0a%3c complete them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that on the fourth day, Malchut is in the state of %0a%3c Katnut, called the small phase of the Moon. As a result, the Moon (Malchut) %0a%3c returns to the state called Shabbat, when all the Light of all the days of creation %0a%3c manifest and shine within her. This is why the Light of the first three days of %0a%3c creation becomes revealed only on Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79. Yet, if Shabbat is Malchut, then why does the Torah say, "My Sabbaths %0a%3c you are to observe," implying two? It is written of the two parts of Shabbat'. %0a%3c the night (Malchut) and the day (ZA) that shines in Malchut. Thus, there %0a%3c is no division between them, for they merge face to face in a Zivug, and are %0a%3c therefore called two Sabbaths. %0a%3c %0a%3c He asks: two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) of the fourth and the seventh days %0a%3c are completely separate, as is written, "You shall keep my Sabbaths," implying %0a%3c two? Yet, when we clarify that the fourth day manifests in perfection only on the %0a%3c seventh day, it becomes clear that there is only one Shabbat. But what is meant %0a%3c here is ZA and Malchut that shine in the holiness of Shabbat, for this day is the %0a%3c male, bestowing part (Zachar) that manifests in the female part (Malchut or Nukva). %0a%3c Hence, they are called Sabbaths (plural). However, by merging in perfection, they %0a%3c become a single whole. As a result, ZA also assumes the name of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 80. Following behind them with the donkeys, the donkey driver asked: "Why %0a%3c is it said, 'You shall fear sanctity?'" They replied: "This refers to the sanctity of %0a%3c Shabbat." The donkey driver asked: "What is the sanctity of Shabbat?" They %0a%3c replied: "It is the sanctity that descends from Above, from AVI." He said to %0a%3c them, "If that is so, then Shabbatot (plural for Shabbat) are without sanctity, %0a%3c for sanctity descends on it from Above, from AVI." Rabbi Aba answered him: %0a%3c "It is indeed so." And it is said: "And call Shabbat a delight, a holy day dedicated %0a%3c to the Creator." Shabbat and a holy day are mentioned separately. The donkey %0a%3c driver asked: "If that is so, then what does a holy day mean to the Creator?" %0a%3c He replied: "That is when sanctity descends from Above, from ZA, and fills %0a%3c Shabbat, Malchut." The donkey driver objected, "But if sanctity descends %0a%3c from Above, then Shabbat itself is not a holy day. And yet, it is written, You %0a%3c shall sanctify Shabbat,' meaning Shabbat itself." Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi %0a%3c Aba, "Leave this man alone, for there is much wisdom in him, of which we do %0a%3c not know." So he said to the donkey driver, "Speak, and we shall listen." %0a%3c %0a%3c The donkey driver's question is this: if Shabbat is ZA, then why is it described %0a%3c as holy? After all, sanctity is the property of AVI, and only AVI are called holy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 227 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he objected that Shabbat should be separated from sanctity. Shabbat (ZA) %0a%3c is not holiness in itself, but because it receives holiness from Above, from AVI. %0a%3c That, which ZA receives from AVI is what is called the Creator's holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81. The donkey driver opened and said, "It is written: Shabbatot, i.e., there %0a%3c are usually two. And this alludes to the border of Shabbat, which is 2,000 %0a%3c AmaH (cubits) in each direction from the city. This is why the word Et was %0a%3c added before the word Shabbatot, which designates the plural form— both the %0a%3c Upper Shabbat and the lower Shabbat joining into one." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although it is said: "Man shall not leave his place on the seventh day" %0a%3c (Shemot, 16), i.e., the singular form is used, in many places in the Torah, the %0a%3c word Et is used; for example, in the sentence: "Et 2,000 Amah in each direction %0a%3c from its place." The word Et, consisting of the first and the last letters of the %0a%3c alphabet, Aleph and Tav, designates Malchut entering into union with ZA, %0a%3c which signifies the state of Shabbat; hence, the Light of AVI becomes revealed %0a%3c and shines (as a supplementary luminescence) upon ZON. This is because AVI %0a%3c are called "two thousand," and so the word Et is present here to designate a %0a%3c supplement of Light to Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exist a Shabbat Above and a Shabbat below: the Upper Shabbat is Partzuf %0a%3c Tvuna, and the lower part of Partzuf Bina, whereas the lower Shabbat is Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut, Nukva de ZA of the world of Atzilut. In the world of Atzilut, Partzuf Bina %0a%3c is divided into two Partzuf im: the Upper Part of Bina is called Partzuf AVI and the %0a%3c lower part of Bina (the part where she receives the Light from the Upper Part %0a%3c so as to pass it to ZA) is called Partzuf YESHSUT (Israel Saba ve Tvuna) or simply %0a%3c Tvuna. The relationship between Bina-AVI and Tvuna is similar to that of ZA %0a%3c and Malchut. Bina is called the "Upper World" and Malchut is called the "lower %0a%3c world." On Shabbat, ZON ascend to Bina, ZA to AVI, and Malchut to Tvuna. %0a%3c %0a%3c On Shabbat, Malchut merges with Tvuna. However, this does not mean that %0a%3c no difference is left between them, for Malchut receives the Light from Tvuna %0a%3c only because she ascends to Tvuna 's level. Yet, at her place on the last, lowest %0a%3c degree of the world of Atzilut, Malchut is unable to receive the Light from Tvuna. %0a%3c And to the extent that Malchut cannot yet receive the Light from Tvuna in her %0a%3c regular state, she is defined as "closed." %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Tvuna suffers from Malchut being closed because while in her place, %0a%3c Malchut cannot receive the Light from Tvuna, for the revelation of Tvuna is %0a%3c possible only through Malchut. On Shabbat, Tvuna and Ima join to form one %0a%3c Partzuf, which is not closed. Yet, since its Light shines only when Malchut ascends %0a%3c to it, Tvuna feels the closed state of Malchut, and suffers, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 228 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 82. One Shabbat was left, unmentioned Above, and felt ashamed. She said to %0a%3c Him, "The Creator of the universe, from the day I was created, I am called %0a%3c Shabbat, but there is no day without night." The Creator replied to her: "My %0a%3c daughter, you are Shabbat, and I have given you this name. But now I am %0a%3c surrounding and adorning you with the most exalted adornment." He then %0a%3c raised His voice and proclaimed, "Those who sanctify shall fear. And this is %0a%3c the night of Shabbat that radiates fear." But who is she? It is the merging %0a%3c together of I (Malchut, the nights of Shabbat) with the Creator Himself (ZA) %0a%3c into a single whole. And I've heard from my father that the word Et refers %0a%3c to the boundaries-borders of Shabbat. Shabbatot (two Sabbaths) denote a %0a%3c circle and a square within, which total two. According to them, there are %0a%3c two sanctities we should mention during the Shabbat blessing: Vayechulu %0a%3c consists of thirty-five words, and Kiddush, too, consists of thirty-five words. %0a%3c Collectively, they make up to the seventy names of ZA, with which ZA (the %0a%3c Creator), and Malchut (the Assembly of Israel) adorn themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83. Since the circle and square are Shabbatot, they are both included in the %0a%3c instruction, "My Shabbatot you are to observe." However, the Upper Shabbat %0a%3c is not included in the instruction "Observe," but rather in "Remember." For %0a%3c the Supernal King, Bina is as perfect as memory. This is why Bina is called %0a%3c "King," whose perfection lies in peace and in memory. Hence, there is no %0a%3c contradiction Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is called the central point of creation, and receives no %0a%3c Light even on Shabbat, as, being a Man'ula (lock), she is closed to the Light. %0a%3c And the entire Light enters her only in the form of Miftacha (key), into Yesod de %0a%3c Malchut, in Malchut that joins Bina with her properties, while Malchut herself is %0a%3c therefore referred to as "locked." %0a%3c %0a%3c This central point of creation is the only thing that the Creator created, and %0a%3c is comprised of all the creatures, including human souls. And she argues with %0a%3c the Creator that in the beginning of creation, in the world of AK, the entire %0a%3c Light was revealed and shone upon the creatures thanks to her, for there was no %0a%3c other Malchut in the world of AK, except for the central point. And only due to %0a%3c Tzimtzum Bet (second restriction), now in the world of Atzilut, was she restricted %0a%3c and closed to the reception of Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is a great and wonderful secret, for, as Malchut objects, even on %0a%3c the first day, it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning- %0a%3c one day." (Beresheet, 1:6) In other words, unity is revealed in both night and %0a%3c day together. Yet, why is the night of the first Shabbat not mentioned in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 229 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Torah, and only the words "on the seventh day" are used? The Creator replied %0a%3c to Malchut that a future Shabbat is implied— Shabbat of the seventh millennium, %0a%3c when the day of Shabbat will come and remain forever. %0a%3c %0a%3c Meanwhile, during the 6,000 years, the Creator elevates Malchut to Bina, and %0a%3c as a result, she receives Supernal Adornments, greater than the ones she had had %0a%3c in the world of AK. For there she acted as the end of all Sefirot, but now she has %0a%3c risen to act in the place of GAR, in AVI, which are called "holy of holies." %0a%3c %0a%3c If Malchut is in Yesod, the lack of Ohr Hochma is felt. But if Malchut ascends %0a%3c to AVI (where Ohr Hassadim is present, and there is absolutely no need for Ohr %0a%3c Hochma), this state is defined as perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called "fear," for she was restricted to refrain from receiving the %0a%3c Creator's Light within her desire to receive pleasure. Therefore, she does not %0a%3c receive the Light from Above within her desire to receive pleasure. Instead, %0a%3c she receives the Light only in Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), when she refuses %0a%3c to use her egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs in the following way: first, Ohr Yashar (Direct Light) comes from %0a%3c the Creator to Malchut and wishes to enter her (Malchut feels both the delight %0a%3c and her own desire to receive and enjoy it). Secondly, by wishing to be like the %0a%3c Creator, Malchut repels the Light (prohibits herself from receiving the delight). %0a%3c %0a%3c This renunciation of egoistic pleasure is called Ohr Hozer (Returning Light), %0a%3c because Malchut repels the Light (pleasure) from her. Thirdly, after Malchut %0a%3c has created Ohr Hozer, she begins to receive Ohr Yashar in it (her new desire %0a%3c to receive only because the Creator wants her to). This reception is possible %0a%3c because Malchut has an anti-egoistic force, will power, called a screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual world is a realm of sensations, desires, and forces, not vested %0a%3c in shells-garments, like the corporeal bodies in our world. Similarly, all the %0a%3c characters depicted in Kabbalah do not designate any images; rather, they %0a%3c demonstrate interactions of forces and properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, a circle implies that the Light shines completely unrestrictedly in %0a%3c every place and to the same extent, so there can be no change in its radiance. %0a%3c A square or a rectangle indicates restrictions, which create differences between %0a%3c the sides: right and left, top and bottom. Hence, the head has a round shape %0a%3c with regard to the rectangular shape of the body, for the Rosh (head) is free of %0a%3c restrictions, but VAK (body) are not. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shabbat is a spiritual state, when ZON ascend to AVI and clothe them. As %0a%3c a result, the lower Shabbat (ZON) and the Upper Shabbat (AVI) merge into one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 230 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat (AVI) is designated by a circle, and the lower Shabbat (ZON) %0a%3c is designated by a square. On Shabbat, ZON merge with AVI, depicted as the %0a%3c square's ascent and insertion into the circle. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma is designated by the letter Ayin. Since Ohr Hochma is revealed %0a%3c only during the ascent of the lower Shabbat to the Upper, Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c divided into two parts: one half for the Upper Shabbat, and one for the lower. %0a%3c Hence, the passage of Vayechulu (Beresheet, 2:1) consists of thirty-five words %0a%3c that refer to half of the Light of the Upper Shabbat, whereas the blessing itself %0a%3c consists of thirty-five words that refer to half of the Light of the lower Shabbat. %0a%3c And the common soul, called the "Assembly of Israel" or Malchut (Shabbat), is %0a%3c adorned with this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the circle and the square merge and assume the name Shabbatot (two %0a%3c Shabbats), the Light of both the circle and the square is defined as protecting— %0a%3c GUARD. And, although the word GUARD alludes to restrictions and borders %0a%3c that one must observe and fear violating, whereas the Upper Shabbat (designated %0a%3c by a circle) has no restrictions and borders, due to the joining of the two Shabbatot %0a%3c into one, there still appeared restrictions and borders. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat is called REMEMBER, and not OBSERVE, as it is %0a%3c completely free of restrictions. However, since it merged with the lower Shabbat, %0a%3c called OBSERVE, it, too, needs to GUARD, which normally relates to Malchut %0a%3c alone. Only due to Malchut 's ascent to Bina did the need to guard, which is %0a%3c present in Malchut, arose in Bina. But Bina herself remains only in the property of %0a%3c REMEMBER, for only egoistic desires to receive pleasure need GUARDING. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Shabbat (Bina) is designated by the letters MI = Mem-Yod. The %0a%3c lower Shabbat (Malchut) is designated by the letters MA = Mem-Hey, and has the %0a%3c form of a square, which implies a presence of controversy between its properties— %0a%3c the right and the left sides, which give it its square form. %0a%3c %0a%3c 84. There are two types of peace below: one is Yaakov (Tifferet), and the other %0a%3c is Yosef (Yesod). Therefore, PEACE is written twice in the greeting: "PEACE, %0a%3c PEACE to the distant one and to the near one." "The distant one" refers to %0a%3c Yaakov, and "the near one" refers to Yosef. Or, as it is written, "From afar I %0a%3c see the Creator," "Came to a stop far in the distance." %0a%3c %0a%3c "Below" signifies ZON, containing one of the properties, Yaakov or the Sefira %0a%3c Tifferet de ZA. ZON also contain the property called Yosef, or Yesod. Both these %0a%3c Sefirot indicate the place of a potential Zivug between ZA and Maichut, for Peace %0a%3c signifies Zivug. The Upper Zivug (Yaakov) is intended for reception of Ohr Hochma %0a%3c from Above, and the lower Zivug (Yosef) fills Malchut only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 231 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned that it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma without %0a%3c it being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Ohr Hochma or the Zivug that is made on it is %0a%3c therefore defined as distant, for it must first be clothed in Ohr Hassadim before %0a%3c it can receive Ohr Hochma. Hence, it is written, "From afar I saw the Creator." %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower Zivug is called "the near one," because the Partzuf receives Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim without any preliminary actions. Furthermore, with the help of this %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, the Partzuf subsequently receives Ohr Hochma. This is why the %0a%3c word "peace" is used twice: "Peace, peace to the far and to the near"— a greeting %0a%3c to Yaakov and Yosef, respectively, both of whom take part in the great Zivug (the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma) in ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c These two greetings are defined in ZON as a square, as there is controversy %0a%3c between them, defined as the controversy between the right and the left sides, %0a%3c and they end in the letter Hey—Nukva or Malchut, whereas the Upper Nukva %0a%3c (Bina) ends with the letter Yod, which designates not the female part, but the %0a%3c male. Hence, there is no controversy in her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even the notions of "near" and "far" do not exist in Bina herself, for %0a%3c she refers to GAR, perfection, and GAR can receive Ohr Hochma nearby, %0a%3c meaning they do not need to clothe in Ohr Hassadim beforehand, but can %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma without Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it is said that the Upper %0a%3c Malchut is the King, who has peace. Thus, unlike ZON, two notions of peace %0a%3c are absent in him. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85. "From afar" is the Supernal Point, standing in His palace, of which it is said, %0a%3c "You are to guard." "You shall fear My sanctity" refers to the point standing %0a%3c in the center, which must be feared more than anything, for its punishment %0a%3c is death, as it is written, "All who transgress in it shall perish." Who are these %0a%3c transgressors? They are those who have entered the space of the circle and the %0a%3c square, and committed a sin. Hence, it is written, "You shall fear!" This point %0a%3c is called "I," and there is a prohibition on its revelation, called HaVaYaH. "I" %0a%3c and HaVaYaH are a single whole. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted %0a%3c from their donkeys and kissed him. They said, "So great is your wisdom, and %0a%3c yet you drive donkeys behind us! Who are you, then?" He replied to them: %0a%3c "Do not ask me who I am, but let us go on and study the Torah. Each of us %0a%3c will speak his wisdom so as to illuminate our path." %0a%3c %0a%3c The distant point refers to the point that opens the way to the Partzuf for %0a%3c thirty-two streams of Ohr Hochma. And this is the letter Bet in the first word %0a%3c of the Torah— Beresheet, called the "point in the hall," from which Ohr Hochma %0a%3c descends to ZON, when ZON ascend to AVI. For then, the two Shabbatot (the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 232 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Upper— AVI and the lower— ZON) merge. It is written about them: "I saw the %0a%3c Creator from afar," for ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma without being clothed %0a%3c in Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma and Bina, called the "point in the hall," are referred to as "distant %0a%3c from ZON," for they need the garment of Ohr Hassadim from the lower world, %0a%3c Nulcva, called MA. Malchut of the world of AK is the central point, called the %0a%3c "lock," whereas Malchut of the world of Atzilut (the point in the hall) is the %0a%3c "key," as the Light from ZATde Bina (YESHSUT) can be received in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The circle is called AVI, the square— ZON. ZON ascend to AVI and thus %0a%3c the square enters the circle. As a result, two properties appear in Malchut of %0a%3c AVI: the "lock" (Malchut de Malchut, the central point or Malchut de AVI), and %0a%3c the "key" (the point in the hall, Yesod de Malchut or Malchut de YESHSUT). %0a%3c Malchut de AVI is called space, for she is unattainable, and he who wishes to %0a%3c fill her with Light is punished by death. It is written about it: "You shall fear %0a%3c My sanctity." %0a%3c %0a%3c The point itself is called "I," and AVI is HaVaYaH that merges with it. And %0a%3c they are defined as a single whole; hence, the point itself is referred to as AVI, %0a%3c meaning that it is characterized as holy, as the property of AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned before, The Zohar and the entire Torah speak %0a%3c exclusively of spiritual degrees, the structure of spiritual worlds, and the %0a%3c revelation of the Creator's governance to us. There is not a word in the Torah %0a%3c that refers to our world. The whole Torah is, as it is said, "The Creator's sacred %0a%3c names." And those who reduce it from its spiritual heights to the corporeal level %0a%3c their commentaries cast it down completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rashi says that the Torah only speaks in human tongue, but it tells us of man's %0a%3c spiritual paths toward his Creator. Therefore, when we read that one Rabbi went %0a%3c to visit another, the real meaning is that one spiritual degree, called, for example, %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar, passes to another spiritual degree, called, for example, Rabbi Yosi. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA has his own AVI, who are called the Upper AVI. The wife of ZA (Nukva %0a%3c or Malchut) contains AVI, too, called YESHSUT. First, ZA attains the AVI of his %0a%3c wife (YESHSUT or Ohr Hassadim). Then it rises to a Higher Degree and attains %0a%3c the AVI themselves— Ohr Hochma (also called Ohr Haya). %0a%3c %0a%3c The righteous who ascend the spiritual degrees are the constituents of %0a%3c Partzuf ZA. Since the degree of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba is Ohr Hassadim (the %0a%3c Light of Neshama), this ascent means it went to (spiritually) see (in Ohr Hochma) %0a%3c another spiritual degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 233 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the spiritual worlds, the donkey driver constitutes a special spiritual force %0a%3c that helps the souls of the righteous move from one spiritual degree to another. %0a%3c Without this help sent by the Creator from Above, it is impossible to exit your %0a%3c degree and ascend to the next. Hence, the Creator sends a Higher soul from %0a%3c Above to each of the righteous (those who wish to ascend). Each receives his %0a%3c own, according to his degree, properties, and purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c And so, at first the righteous fails to recognize this exalted soul; he %0a%3c considers it low, that it leeched onto him on his spiritual path. Such state %0a%3c is called Ibur— conception of the righteous' soul. Since the Higher soul has %0a%3c not yet completed its assistance and purpose, it is not yet perceived by the %0a%3c righteous for what it really is. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after it completes its task in its entirety, and brings the righteous' %0a%3c soul to the Upper Degree for which it is intended, the righteous then reveals %0a%3c the exalted properties of the soul that helped him. This is referred to as the %0a%3c revelation of the soul to the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our case, the soul that was sent to help the souls of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a%3c Aba was the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba— a very exalted and perfect soul, the %0a%3c Light of Yechida. Yet, initially, it is revealed to the righteous in its smallest scope, %0a%3c called Ibur, conception (in sensations). Hence, they perceive it as the level of a %0a%3c spiritual donkey driver— a simple soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew word for donkey is Hamor, which also means matter, Homer] %0a%3c Thus, one who can control his donkey, his body, his desires, ascends above matter %0a%3c as a spiritual being. And since he wishes to ascend above matter in his desires, he %0a%3c is considered a righteous. However, here, The Zohar speaks of Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c The donkey driver's task is to take the riders, mounted atop of their donkeys, %0a%3c from place to place; yet, he walks in front of his donkeys, thereby leading them %0a%3c through spiritual degrees. Since every word in the Torah has several meanings, %0a%3c due to the multiplicity of the Upper Roots (wherefrom word notions descend), %0a%3c the notion of a "donkey driver" is more precisely referred to as a "donkey guide," %0a%3c and implies properties that are coarse, sinful, and most base. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Aba said: "Let us open the gates of the Torah, for the time %0a%3c has come for us to correct our path," that is, to open their souls with the help %0a%3c of the secrets of the Torah, so their path would be correct and lead them to %0a%3c the Creator. Rabbi Elazar then began to discuss a passage from the Torah that %0a%3c says, "You shall observe my Shabbatot," as he stood at this degree (the Light of %0a%3c YESHSUT) in his properties. He therefore concluded that Shabbat itself is the %0a%3c property of ZON, which has not yet reached the property of sanctity, but only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 234 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c receives the Light of YESHSUT on Shabbat. It is written about this Light, "You %0a%3c shall fear my sanctity," for when Ohr Hochma passes from YESHSUT to ZA, it %0a%3c evokes fear in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here they receive the donkey driver's help, who reveals to them the %0a%3c secret of Ohr Haya. He explains that the phrase "You shall observe my Shabbatot" %0a%3c signifies the Upper and the lower Shabbatot, which come together, due to the %0a%3c ascent of ZON to AVI. As a result, ZON themselves become holy (the square %0a%3c within the circle) and acquire the properties of Bina: mercy, altruism, Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. Hence, it is written with regard to them: fear not and observe. For %0a%3c Ohr Haya repels foreign, impure forces and desires, and all restrictions are lifted %0a%3c on Shabbat; hence, there is no fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c And, according to the donkey driver's explanation, the phrase "You shall %0a%3c fear My sanctity" refers only to the central point that is used in GAR de AVI, in %0a%3c GAR of Ohr Haya, which is unattainable and where fear does exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c At that, the soul of the donkey driver has fulfilled its role, for it brought %0a%3c them to the attainment of Ohr Haya. Only then did they merit the attainment %0a%3c of the height of the soul that had helped them, since they attained its revelation %0a%3c and were thus able to appreciate it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted from their donkeys %0a%3c and kissed him, for the attainment of the Upper One is defined as a "kiss." %0a%3c However, this exalted soul has not yet finished aiding them: it must still help %0a%3c them attain Ohr Yechida. Yet, since the attainment of Ohr Haya already provides %0a%3c perfection, they've already attained thereby the degree of the son of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself is the degree of attainment %0a%3c of Ohr Yechida. Therefore, by attaining only Ohr Haya, they mistakenly %0a%3c thought that the soul guiding them belongs to the son of Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba. However, after the donkey driver had revealed to them the secret of the %0a%3c attainment of Ohr Yechida, they realized that their companion is none other %0a%3c than Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the reason why they could not recognize him before is that the powers %0a%3c of the helping soul cannot be seen until its role is fulfilled. Hence, they asked %0a%3c him to reveal his name, but he told them not to inquire about his name, for %0a%3c without having completed all the corrections, they do not merit the revelation %0a%3c of the secrets of the Torah. And he must help them in their studies of the %0a%3c Torah, for he still needs to illuminate their path, as they have not yet attained %0a%3c the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 235 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 86. He said to him: "Who appointed you to walk here and be a donkey driver?" %0a%3c He replied: "The letter Yod waged war with two letters, Chaf and Samech, for %0a%3c me to come and join. The letter Chaf did not want to leave its place because it %0a%3c has to support those who fall, for without a screen, they cannot survive." %0a%3c %0a%3c 87. The letter Yod came to me alone, kissed me and wept with me. It said to %0a%3c me, "My son, what can I do for you? I disappear from many good deeds and %0a%3c from secret, supernal, basic letters. But I shall return to you and will be of %0a%3c help to you. And I shall give you two letters that are more exalted than those %0a%3c that have disappeared— the letters Yod and Shin. They shall become for you a %0a%3c treasury that is forever full. So, my son, go and drive the donkeys. And that is %0a%3c why I am here in this role." %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the donkey driver is an auxiliary force given to someone %0a%3c who wishes to ascend to a higher spiritual degree on his path toward the Creator, %0a%3c just as donkeys carry people on their backs, thereby helping them travel from %0a%3c one place to another. As this happens, the righteous one falls from his previous %0a%3c degree and enters the embryonic state of the new degree, just as the soul that %0a%3c came to help him. However, the property of Ibur-embryo (lbur is also derived %0a%3c from the word Haavarah, crossing) means that all the Light that it had in the %0a%3c previous degree disappears upon the conception (lbur) of a new, Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c And that is what they wanted to know of the donkey driver: "How did the %0a%3c Creator bring you here in the state of lbur, in our state of lbur, as a result of which %0a%3c the Light in us has disappeared? Who lowers you from the Higher Degrees?" %0a%3c And that is why the donkey driver replied that the letter Yod waged war against %0a%3c the letters Chaf and Samech, to join with them. The degree of Hassadim is called %0a%3c Samech (Ohr Neshama). %0a%3c %0a%3c "When the time has come for you to attain Ohr Haya (Yod from HaVaYaH, %0a%3c the degree from which I descended to help you to attain Ohr Haya), Hochma %0a%3c really wanted to connect Ohr Neshama (that was previously in you) to me. And %0a%3c here Yod wages war against Chaf and Samech. Malchut of the Upper Partzuf %0a%3c clothes in the lower Partzuf, designated by the letter Chaf. There used to be Ohr %0a%3c Neshama, and now there is Ohr Haya, whereas Yod, which desires Ohr Neshama %0a%3c as well, merges with it, and rejects the Chaf." %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because the connection between the degrees, from the Highest %0a%3c Degree in the world of Atzilut to the end of the world of Assiya, is realized only %0a%3c by Malchut of the Upper One descending to the lower one and clothing in it. %0a%3c Malchut of the Upper One herself cannot descend from her degree of YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 236 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (the degree of Neshama) even for a moment, as the chain connecting the degrees %0a%3c would be instantly broken. %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Samech is the property of the Light itself, which the soul %0a%3c receives from Sefirot HBD HGT of AVI (above the Cha^eh), and which AVI pass %0a%3c to ZON when the letters are in Katnut, and support them (the Hebrew word for %0a%3c support is Somech, derived from the letter Samech) so that ZON will not fall from %0a%3c the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Chaf, Hassadim, is unwilling to leave its place and join Hochma, %0a%3c as it needs to connect the Upper Partzuf to the lower one. Thus, it must always %0a%3c remain in its place, for all the degrees are constant, and only the soul changes %0a%3c while moving from one degree to another within the worlds. This is why the %0a%3c soul is called the "inner part" with regard to the world (the external part)— the %0a%3c soul exists and moves about within the world by changing its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Light of the soul did not wish to join the letter Yod (degree of %0a%3c Hochma, the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba) as it descended to help Rabbi Elazar %0a%3c and Rabbi Aba. This is because they needed a new Light that would build a new %0a%3c degree within them, the degree of Ohr Haya, whereas each new degree is built from %0a%3c scratch, from the state of Ibur (conception). As that happens, the entire previous %0a%3c degree with all of its Light disappears. Similarly, in their case, the new degree %0a%3c starts with Ibur and reaches the level of Haya. This resembles a seed that must %0a%3c first abandon its present form and rot, in order to become a tree afterwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that it came to me without the Light of HBD HGT %0a%3c de AVI, called Samech, the Light of Hassadim. Samech is the property of mercy, a %0a%3c selfless desire to give, pure spiritual altruism. Hence, it is unwilling to join Yod, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Yet, Ohr Hochma cannot enter and fill the Partzuf without first %0a%3c being clothed in Ohr Hassadim, for this clothing of Ohr Hochma in Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c means that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma not for itself, but for the Creator's %0a%3c sake. But Ohr Hassadim, Samech, does not wish to receive anything within itself; %0a%3c it wants nothing to do with Ohr Hochma] This is why the letter Yod wept, being %0a%3c unable to fill the Partzuf with its Light, for Hassadim refused to accept Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in this regard: Hence, I must now disappear, and you, the donkey %0a%3c driver, go to the state of Ibur, to rebuild the degrees of gradual development of %0a%3c a new Part?u/-state with you: Ibur (embryo), Leidah (birth), Yenika (nursing), and %0a%3c Mochin (maturity). %0a%3c %0a%3c And know that such is the order of creating (begetting) each new degree: %0a%3c every time one is to attain a new degree, he must undergo (in his properties) a %0a%3c complete disappearance of the previous degree (level of attainment, Light), and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 237 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c begin anew. He must receive new attainments, from the lowest new degree, Ohr %0a%3c Nefesh (Ibur), to Ohr Ruach (Yenika), and so on, as though he had never attained %0a%3c any spiritual level at all. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to take with you anything from a previous degree. Hence, one %0a%3c must start anew from the lowest level of Ibur, called THE DONKEY DRIVER. %0a%3c Ohr Haya de AVI is called YESH (Yod-Shin), where Yod is Hochma and Shin is Bina. %0a%3c And, of course, they are more important than the Ohr Neshama that was in the %0a%3c Partzuf before them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba rejoiced, wept, and said, "You sit on the %0a%3c donkey, and we shall drive it." He replied to them, "Have I not told you that %0a%3c it is the command of the King that I act as I do, until the other donkey driver %0a%3c appears" (this hints at the Mashiach, who, as it is said, will appear poor and %0a%3c riding a donkey). They said to him, "You have not even told us your name! %0a%3c Where do you dwell?" He told them, "My dwelling place is wonderful %0a%3c and very precious to me. It is a tower that soars in the air, grand and unique. %0a%3c Only two live in this tower: the Creator and I. That is the place, in which %0a%3c I dwell. And I am exiled from there in order to drive the donkeys." Rabbi %0a%3c Elazar and Rabbi Aba looked at him, and his words were unclear to them, for %0a%3c they tasted sweeter than manna and honey. They said to him, "Perhaps you %0a%3c will tell us the name of your father, so that we could kiss the earth at his feet?" %0a%3c He responded, "What for? It is not my habit to boast of the Torah." %0a%3c %0a%3c After they have attained the greatness of the donkey driver's degree, they %0a%3c could no longer bear his small state of Ibur, which he inhabited for their sake. %0a%3c Hence, they told him that since they have already attained Ohr Hochma, he has %0a%3c done enough and can leave the state of Ibur. And should a need arise to add %0a%3c anything else to them, they would be able to enter Ibur on their own, and he %0a%3c does not need to suffer for their sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the donkey driver warned them beforehand to not ask him his %0a%3c name, for they still require revelations of secrets of the Torah. Once again, he %0a%3c hinted that it is the degree of Ohr Yechida that they lack, which is implied here. %0a%3c This degree signifies the reception of the Light of the King Messiah's face, %0a%3c which he mentioned by hinting at the poor donkey driver, as described by a %0a%3c prophet (Zachariah, 9:9). And he is commanded by the Creator to help them %0a%3c attain Ohr Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why they asked him about the type of his soul: "For you did not wish %0a%3c to reveal your name, as we have not yet received from you that which we must %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 238 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c attain. But if so, at least tell us where you live, what is your degree? At least then %0a%3c we will know what we lack, what else we must receive, attain from you." %0a%3c %0a%3c He replied that his place is much higher than his present location, for now %0a%3c he himself cannot attain his own individual level. This is a result of the Upper %0a%3c Partzuf descending to the place of the lower one and becoming completely %0a%3c identical to it, and while there (in that state), the Upper Partzuf can no longer %0a%3c attain its own level. The tower that soars in the air is Bina, Hassadim. The %0a%3c Mashiach's tower (the great tower) designates the time (state) of ascent to GAR de %0a%3c AA, when Ohr Hochma is available. %0a%3c %0a%3c 89. But the place of my father's dwelling was in the Great Sea. And he was %0a%3c a big fish that continually circled the Great Sea, from one end to the other. %0a%3c And he was mighty and he grew old, until he swallowed up all the other fish %0a%3c in that sea. And then he released them, and they were thriving and filled %0a%3c with all of the very best of the world. And it was in his power to swim across %0a%3c the entire sea in one instant. And He pulled him out and hauled him in %0a%3c with an arrow, like a warrior, and brought him to the place that I told you %0a%3c about, to the tower that soars in the air, but he returned to his place and %0a%3c disappeared in that sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c The concealed Zivug is called Shaar HaNun (the 50 th gate). The Great Sea is %0a%3c Malchut. All the Zivugim from Partzuf Atik de Atzilut and below do not include %0a%3c the Great Sea in its entirety, all the Sefirot of Malchut, but only the first nine %0a%3c Sefirot of Malchut. Moreover, none of the Zivugim include Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Sefira, Malchut de Malchut, is the only creation, because all the other %0a%3c Sefirot constitute properties of spiritual forces and desires above Malchut, existing %0a%3c in and referring to the Creator, the sole purpose of which is the correction of %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut. The only Zivug on this Malchut exists in Atik, and it will be %0a%3c revealed to all only at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Hamnuna-Saba emerged from this concealed Zivug in Atik; hence, the %0a%3c donkey driver calls him "my father." And he says that his father lived in the %0a%3c Great Sea, as this Zivug was on the entire Malchut, on Malchut de Malchut, called %0a%3c the "Great Sea." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if one were to argue that all Partzufim make a Zivug on the Light with %0a%3c a screen that stands before Malchut, then that Zivug was made on the 50 th gate, %0a%3c on all the parts of the desire, on the full depth of the Great Sea (Malchut), down %0a%3c to the very last of her desires and properties, from Keter de Malchut to Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut, from end to end of the Great Sea. Nevertheless, this occurs only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 239 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In Partzuf Atik de Atzilut, but not below it. And this is not the donkey driver %0a%3c himself, but his father. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because the great Zivug absorbs all the other particular Zivugim %0a%3c ("swallows all the other fish in the Great Sea") and all the souls in all the worlds, %0a%3c for they are all much weaker than it. Hence, it is as though they do not exist in %0a%3c its greatness and might. And since it includes absolutely everything, they are all %0a%3c called by the name Nunin, from the letter Nun (50). %0a%3c %0a%3c This indicates that after all the major corrections that follow this great Zivug, %0a%3c all those Lights and souls, absorbed during its Zivug, return and are born anew %0a%3c for eternal life, for they are completely filled with Light as a result of the great %0a%3c Zivug, when the Light absorbed them completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the Zivugim below Partzuf Atik stem from unifications of the Sefirot with %0a%3c one another. These unifications are defined as interruptions in a Zivug, whereas %0a%3c the Zivug in Atik is direct and without unification. Thus, it is defined as "instant," %0a%3c for it goes on uninterrupted. It is therefore written that "he crosses the entire %0a%3c sea in an instant," without any garments-unifications. And it mounts an attack, %0a%3c for there is great power of reception of Ohr Hochma in this Zivug; hence, he said: %0a%3c "Begets, like an arrow in the hands of a warrior." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of this Zivug in Partzuf Atik: "No one else but you saw the %0a%3c Creator." However, no birth is possible without the forces of resistance, since, %0a%3c as is written: "The seed that is not shot like an arrow does not beget." (Talmud, %0a%3c Hagigah, 16). Hence, after he had begotten me and hid me in the Great Tower, %0a%3c he returned to his concealed Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c 90. Rabbi Elazar contemplated his words and replied: "You are the son of the %0a%3c Holy Source, you are the son of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, you are the son of the %0a%3c Source of the Torah, and you drive donkeys behind us!" They wept and kissed %0a%3c him, and continued their journey. Then he said: "If it pleases our master, let %0a%3c him reveal his name to us." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written "looked," because sight signifies Hochma, and no other words, %0a%3c such as "said," "heard" (Bina) or "thought" could be used in its stead. Since they %0a%3c have not yet attained to the full extent of perfection what the donkey driver %0a%3c had told them, and their attainment reached only as high as Ohr Haya, they %0a%3c were delighted with what was begotten by Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, for Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba is Ohr Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c He asked him to reveal his name, that is, to receive his degree, for the %0a%3c attainment of a name denotes the attainment of the spiritual degree. Therefore, %0a%3c the saying, "the entire Torah consists only of the Creator's names," means that the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 240 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c entire Torah constitutes the degrees that one must attain, up to the very highest, %0a%3c called "Love" ("Introduction to The Study of the Ten Sefirot," items 70-71). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each degree in the attainment of the Upper Worlds has its own name. All %0a%3c the Creator's names: Moshe, Pharaoh, Avraham, the Temple, Sinai— every single %0a%3c word in the Torah— are degrees of perception of the Creator, degrees of attaining %0a%3c Him, for nothing exists besides man and his Creator. Everything else that exists %0a%3c in the world, as it seems to us, are the various degrees of our perception of the %0a%3c Creator Himself. He may appear to us as this world, and He may appear as the %0a%3c world of Assiya, as Yetzira, Beria, Atzilut, or He may be revealed completely, without %0a%3c partial concealments of the spiritual world or total concealment of our world. %0a%3c Thus, the word Olam (world) is derived from the Haalamah (concealment). %0a%3c %0a%3c 91. He opened and began. It is written, "Benayahu (Benaiah) Ben (the son %0a%3c of) Yehoyada (Jehoiada)." This narrative is beautiful, but it serves to show %0a%3c us the exalted secrets of the Torah. And the name Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada %0a%3c indicates the secret of the Light of Wisdom, Ohr Hochma. Ben Ish Choi %0a%3c is the righteous who revives the worlds. Rav Paalim means that He is the %0a%3c Master of all that transpires, and that all the forces and Supernal Troops %0a%3c stem from Him. He is called the Creator of Force, the Master of all, and He %0a%3c is in everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in Prophets: "Benayahu, the son of Yehoyada," (Shmuel II, %0a%3c 23:20). Here, The Zohar reveals to us the exalted secrets of the Torah, for the %0a%3c holy name of Yehoyada consists of two: Yod-Hey-Vav, the first three letters of %0a%3c HaVaYaH, and Yeda (knowledge). %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter of the world of Atzilut is called RADLA (unattainable head), whereas %0a%3c Atik itself surrounds all the other Partzufim of the world of Atzilut— AA, AVI, and %0a%3c ZON. Atik is called Makif (surrounding), for the other, lower Partzufim cannot %0a%3c attain it or its Zivug. Moreover, they cannot attain anything that comes from it. %0a%3c In other words, there is nothing descending from Atik to the lower Partzufim. %0a%3c Even AA is concealed from them; hence, it is called the "concealed Hochma." %0a%3c However, it is not defined as unattainable, like Atik, for it contains a Zivug on %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. Nevertheless, this Light does not descend to the lower ones, but %0a%3c only a small luminescence from it, called He'arat Hochma, reaches them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the Light that fills the worlds through the 6,000 years comes from %0a%3c AVI and YESHSUT, who are called Hochma of the thirty-two paths or thirty-two %0a%3c forces (Elokim) of creation, i.e., thirty-two types of He'arat Hochma. This Light of %0a%3c Hochma is the result of Bina's ascent to AA, where she receives Ohr Hochma and %0a%3c shines downward. Therefore, all the Light of Hochma that is revealed through %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 241 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the 6,000 years, before the end of correction, is no more than the Light of Bina, %0a%3c which received Ohr Hochma upon ascending to AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c AA is called Yeda (knowledge) because it gives Ohr Hochma to Bina, and %0a%3c knows all the routes of Ohr Hochma into Bina and through her on to the lower %0a%3c ones. While making a Zivug, AA itself does not pass its Light downwards, but %0a%3c as AVI ascend to AA, they receive Ohr Hochma, called "thirty-two streams" or %0a%3c "paths of wisdom," which can be attained by the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything that is written in The Zohar refers to all the souls in general. %0a%3c However, there are exceptions that are not normally studied. There exist special, %0a%3c exalted souls that merit becoming a Kli, MAN for the great Zivug of RADLA %0a%3c after their exile, and to receive from this Zivug in the Upper World the degree %0a%3c of Yechida. These are the souls of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba and a very few chosen others. These exalted souls reveal themselves to the %0a%3c righteous in this world, and as a result, the righteous merit delighting in Ohr %0a%3c Yechida, which shines only in such exalted souls, while still being in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the name of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada indicates that it stems from %0a%3c the inner wisdom, the unattainable Light of Hochma of Atik. This name also %0a%3c causes the concealment of the Light of Hochma, for the name Yehoyada: Yod-Hey- %0a%3c Vav + Yeda means that only he who attains the first three letters Yod-Hey-Vav of %0a%3c the Creator's name HaVaYaH shall attain Him, and no other shall. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, this name remains concealed in its place. At first, the donkey %0a%3c driver explains the quality of this Zivug in Atik— its height, the power of the Light %0a%3c that emerges onto it in Rosh de Atik, which the name of this Zivug, "Ben hh Chai %0a%3c Rav Paalim ve Mekabtziel," indicates. And then he explains what is concealed and %0a%3c what descends to the souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already stated that this Zivug takes place at the end of the correction of %0a%3c the entire Malchut. Hence, it includes all the individual Zivugim and the degrees %0a%3c that emerge on them through the 6,000 years. All the Lights accumulate into %0a%3c one. All the types of MAN combine into one and ascend to ask for this Zivug, %0a%3c which includes all the suffering and punishments gradually accumulated during %0a%3c the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the height and greatness of this Zivug and the degree of Light that %0a%3c emerges from it are infinite, and it destroys all the impure forces once and for %0a%3c all. Yesod de ZA, from which the Light of this Zivug (the combination of all the %0a%3c Lights over the full course of the 6,000 years) is emanated, is called "hh Chai Rav %0a%3c Paalim"— a vivid man of many actions. However, Malchut, which contains within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 242 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c her all the MAN, suffering, and work performed during the 6,000 years, is called %0a%3c Mekabtziel (gathering one). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also calls it Tzadik Chai Olamim— the righteous, who revives the %0a%3c worlds, for it thereby points to the Sefira Yesod, which gives the Light to Malchut. %0a%3c The Sefira Yesod does not have a place to receive the Light for itself. Hence, it %0a%3c lives (Chai) only to pass the Light to Malchut. This is why it is called Tzadik (the %0a%3c righteous one), who revives the worlds (Chai Olamim). %0a%3c %0a%3c Its other name, Rav Paalim (performing many actions) indicates that %0a%3c it includes all the MAD of all the good deeds and all the degrees that were %0a%3c revealed through the 6,000 years. This is because all these degrees are now being %0a%3c revealed all at once in a cumulative, integrated Light, as they leave Yesod and %0a%3c enter Malchut. And since Yesod now gathers all the Light that was emanated %0a%3c during the 6,000 years into one, and passes it to Malchut, this action determines %0a%3c its name— Rav Paalim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 92. Rav Paalim is also Mekabtziel— the Exalted Tree, gathering and %0a%3c performing many actions, Supreme Above all. Where did it come from? %0a%3c From which degree did it originate? Once more, the source indicates— from %0a%3c Mekabtziel, for it is an exalted and concealed degree that none has seen. %0a%3c It includes everything, for it gathers all of the Upper Light within it, and %0a%3c everything originates from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut-Nukva is also named Mekabtziel, for she receives and gathers all the %0a%3c Light from Yesod within herself. Hence, Yesod is called Rav Paalim. The degree %0a%3c that emerges onto this Zivug is called the "Supreme and Exalted Tree" that %0a%3c originated from Yesod and entered Malchut. The Zohar goes on to explain that to %0a%3c show us the quality and the origin of this exalted degree, the name Mekabtziel %0a%3c (gathering) is used; Yesod accumulates the Upper Light and passes it to Nukva. %0a%3c And both Yesod and Malchut are called Mekabtziel %0a%3c %0a%3c And the degree that emerges onto this Zivug of Yesod and Malchut is called %0a%3c "None but you has seen the Creator." This degree emerges after the complete %0a%3c correction has been achieved, at the moment of attachment of the final correction %0a%3c that completes them all. Therefore, this degree is defined as all-inclusive, for it %0a%3c collects all the Light over the full course of 6,000 years, and thereby manifests at %0a%3c once in its true perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 93. All of the degrees gather in this Supernal, Sacred, and Concealed Hall, %0a%3c where everything is concealed. All of the worlds are inside that hall. All the %0a%3c holy forces are sustained and revived by it, and all are dependant on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 243 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar speaks of Rosh de Atik, where all the degrees and all the Light %0a%3c of all the worlds are concentrated and concealed. It further explains how this %0a%3c Zivug can occur up to the final correction, so it would combine all the degrees %0a%3c emerging one after another during the 6,000 years. And it would emerge instantly %0a%3c during the 6,000 years of the world's existence, when the degrees are in a state of %0a%3c constant ascents and descents, for as soon as a new degree, a new attainment of %0a%3c the Creator, of the Light, is revealed, the present degree disappears. This occurs %0a%3c due to the sin of the lower ones, who cannot retain this degree permanently %0a%3c (world— Olam, from the word Haalamah— concealment. The complete revelation %0a%3c of the Creator to His Creatures will take place at the end of the 6,000 years; %0a%3c thus, the world-concealment will cease to exist). %0a%3c %0a%3c So, whenever a degree disappears, it does so only from the sensation of one %0a%3c who attains a new degree. In reality, this degree ascends to Rosh de Atik and hides %0a%3c there, so as to, by joining other degrees, be manifested at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same way, Atik gathers all the degrees revealed in the world during %0a%3c the 6,000 years, and conceals them within itself until the time of the end of %0a%3c correction comes; WHEN IT CORRECTS THE LAST PORTION OF WHAT %0a%3c IT MUST CORRECT, AND THUS CANNOT NO LONGER SIN. AND IT %0a%3c NO LONGER NEEDS TO SIN TO CORRECT THE NEXT PORTION OF %0a%3c EGOISM; HENCE, THIS FINAL DEGREE REMAINS PERMANENTLY %0a%3c AND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR. Then, Atik gathers all the degrees, and they all %0a%3c manifest simultaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everyone has his own Partzuf Atik. How can one accelerate his advancement %0a%3c long the degrees of correction in this world and in the spiritual worlds? It if %0a%3c ritten in the Talmud that an old man bends as he walks, as if he's looking %0a%3c jmething that he had lost. %0a%3c %0a%3c An old man symbolizes someone of wisdom, Hochma, for even without ha %0a%3c lost anything, he looks beforehand for things he can correct in himself, and %0a%3c finds them. Hence, he does not require the previous degree of attainment to %0a%3c disappear from him. And if one does not discover new egoistic properties in %0a%3c need of correction within him, his previous degree disappears and a new one %0a%3c begins. However, this process is considerably slower than when one acts like %0a%3c old man in search of shortcomings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Throughout the 6,000 years, Atik is defined as unattainable. Therefore, its %0a%3c head is called RADLA (an abbreviation for the Aramaic words, Reisha de Lo %0a%3c Etiada, the "unattainable head"), whereas the name Atik is derived from the %0a%3c word Ne'etak (isolated) from the lower ones, for it does not shine upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 244 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And, although it accumulates within all the Lights that emerge from it itself and %0a%3c become revealed in the lower worlds, the Light of the end of correction remains %0a%3c concealed nonetheless. It follows that after each degree disappears due to the %0a%3c sins of the lower ones, it ascends to Rosh de Atik and conceals itself there. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Guf de Atik, from its Peh downward, is located inside all the other %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, i.e., it is attainable by them. Thus, by clothing %0a%3c in the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, Atik shines through them and gives the %0a%3c Light to them and to all the lower worlds of BYA. And any Light that shines on %0a%3c creation during the 6,000 years comes only from Guf de Atik, and not from some %0a%3c other spiritual object. %0a%3c %0a%3c We usually say that whatever is present in the Rosh of a Partzuf manifests in %0a%3c its Guf. This is also true with regard to all the Partzufim of the world of AK and %0a%3c all the other Partzufim in all the worlds, except in Partzuf Atik! This is so because %0a%3c Atik remains in Tzimtzum Aleph and descends down to our world. However, with %0a%3c regard to other Partzufim below it, Atik acts as though it is in T^imt^um Bet, making %0a%3c a special Zivug on itself and the Light from it descends to the lower worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that comes to revive the worlds is called "sustenance" or Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, and the Light that comes to stimulate the growth of the Partzufim, %0a%3c to turn a small Partzuf (Katnut) into a big one (Gadlut) is called Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c Both these Lights originate in Guf de Atik. Ohr Hochma, which makes a Partzuf %0a%3c big, is called the Light that elevates the Partzuf, for the lying position is called %0a%3c Ibur (embryo), the sitting position is called Katnut (small), and the standing %0a%3c position— Gadlut (big). %0a%3c %0a%3c 94. He slew two— Ariel and Moav (Moab). Two Holy Temples existed thanks %0a%3c to Atik and received from it: the First Temple and the Second Temple. Since %0a%3c Atik's disappearance, the process that stemmed from Above had ceased. It is %0a%3c as though he struck and destroyed them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only Malchut de Malchut must be corrected, and nothing else. All the other %0a%3c properties do not require correction. This Malchut de Malchut is Malchut of Olam %0a%3c Ein Sof (the World of Infinity), Behina Dalet, Nukva de ZA or Partzuf BON— the %0a%3c Creator's only creation, the will to receive (pleasure) for oneself. It is this desire %0a%3c that caused the breaking of the Kelim (vessels)— the sin of Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the work of the righteous during the 6,000 years concerns the %0a%3c correction of Malchut, so she becomes precisely as she was prior to the breaking %0a%3c of the Kelim and the sin of Adam. As a result, the great Zivug on T^imt^um Aleph %0a%3c in Rosh de Atik will be revealed. The Light of this Zivug enables man to sort and %0a%3c separate his impure desires from the pure ones, and thus forever rid himself of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 245 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the impure egoistic forces. This is exactly what Prophet Yeshayahu writes about: %0a%3c "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Malchut, Partzuf BON of the world of Atzilut, is completely corrected %0a%3c already and does not require any further corrections, her Partzuf BON ascends %0a%3c to the level of Partzuf SAG of the world of AK. Thus, Malchut completely attains %0a%3c the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, meanwhile, after the great Zivug in Atilc, but before the ascent of %0a%3c Partzuf BON to SAG, the Light of Atilc stops shining. As a result, the two Temples %0a%3c were destroyed. The two temples are the two Lights of Hochma: the Light of AVI, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma de Haya that shines in the First Temple, and the Light of YESHSUT, %0a%3c Ohr Neshama that shines in the Second Temple. And all the Light that Israel %0a%3c received from Atilc disappears. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all these destructions and disappearances of Light are corrections %0a%3c and milestones on the path to deliverance and complete correction. They signify %0a%3c not devastation, but creation of perfection, as they are precisely those final %0a%3c corrections that bring BON back to SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since all the roots and sources of what transpires in this world exist in the %0a%3c spiritual realm, and must all manifest once in our world, every spiritual ro %0a%3c must "touch" its branch in our world, and it does not matter when this oo %0a%3c In the spiritual world, everything unfolds in accordance with a strict cause-an %0a%3c effect process, whereas in our world those same consequences can manifest at a %0a%3c completely different time. %0a%3c %0a%3c An example of this is the destruction of the First and the Second Temples. %0a%3c While this event has already transpired in our world, in the spiritual world it %0a%3c occurs only when the last stage of correction is attained. Due to the complexity %0a%3c of time-transcending notions, we will examine this matter in another book. %0a%3c However, one way or another, only our inner spiritual properties can become the %0a%3c Temple in which we will feel the Creator and in which He will forever dwell! %0a%3c %0a%3c At the end of correction, Ohr Haya and Ohr Neshama will be called the %0a%3c First and the Second Temples, respectively. Also, until the end of correction, %0a%3c Ohr Haya, which is received on the Zivug of Malchut and included in Yesod, is %0a%3c led Shahhat (Sabbath), while Ohr Neshama is called Hoi (weekdays). As wi %0a%3c ere is absolutely no connection between these Lights and the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After the destruction of the spiritual Temples (the disappearance of Light), %0a%3c they will be recreated from Above by the screen of Bina, called "Heaven." This is %0a%3c because the screen of Partzuf SAG is a property of absolute mercy and is completely %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 246 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c unrestricted in its actions, desiring only to bestow and refrain from receiving Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Thus, it is beyond the influence of any restrictions and limitations. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of this Zivug, the two Temples will be restored forever, and "the %0a%3c Light of the Moon (Malchut) shall be as the Light of the Sun (Bina)" (Yeshayahu, %0a%3c 30:26). The Light of Bina, which is now the Light of ZA (called "the sun"), %0a%3c will be seven times more powerful, as ZAT de Atik. From there, this Light will %0a%3c descend to AVI and create the first seven days of creation, for ZA (the sun) will %0a%3c become like AB and contain the Light of Guf de Atik. Malchut will become like %0a%3c ZA and receive his Light, the Light of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the end of correction, a Zivug on Malchut herself (the primordial, but %0a%3c corrected egoism) will transpire, and all the particular Zivugim that were made %0a%3c on all the Lights through the 6,000 years (made not on Malchut, but on her %0a%3c inclusion in Yesod) will thereby disappear. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Temple will be restored from Heaven, for Bina herself does not wish to %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma. And it will not occur because she cannot, but because she %0a%3c does not want to. This degree is referred to as "in the hands of Heaven." For %0a%3c example, it is written in the blessing on the new moon: "Life, which contains %0a%3c the fear of Heaven, and the fear of sinning." This life is above our reasoning and %0a%3c desires, for it is said that faith must be "above reason"; otherwise, sins will ensue. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, one desires nothing more than to go by faith above his reason and %0a%3c desires, for he is afraid to sin. However, there exists an even Higher Degree: when %0a%3c he no longer fears sinning, as he now has a screen, but still prefers to proceed by %0a%3c faith above reason and desires, for he yearns to be dissolved in the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the Light's disappearance from Guf de Atik prior to these %0a%3c corrections is that the two Malchu^ot (Bina and Malchut, called SAG and BON) %0a%3c no longer exist. After the great Zivug of Atik, BON were annulled along with %0a%3c the screen of SAG, as Guf de Atik contains the connection between Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, designed for their interaction during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of such interaction between Bina and Malchut, an opportunity %0a%3c arises to partially, gradually correct Malchut. In this mutual Zivug with Malchut, %0a%3c which is merged with Bina (Bina's properties), Atik first creates AA and then all %0a%3c the other Partzufim of the worlds of Atzilut and BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the screen of Malchut (Masach de BON) now disappears, the %0a%3c screen of Bina (Masach de SAG) disappears as well, as they are merged together. %0a%3c In the absence of Malchut and the screen, this Zivug stops, and all the Light of %0a%3c Guf de Atik emanating from this Zivug on the mutual screen of Malchut and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 247 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina disappears. Therefore, all the Light that descended from its Guf (called %0a%3c Temples) disappeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Rosh de Atik there is a Zivug on Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. Merged with %0a%3c Bina and existing for 6,000 years, the screen of Malchut disappears. As a result, %0a%3c the Light disappears as well. Malchut has yet to ascend to SAG to receive her %0a%3c perfection, as there is still no new Light. This complete absence of Light is called %0a%3c "destruction." However, Malchut then receives the Light of AVI, and the worlds %0a%3c of BYA merge with the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 95. And the Holy Throne (Malchut) is overthrown. Hence, the prophet %0a%3c Yechezkel (Ezekiel) wrote, "I am in exile," signifying that the degree called %0a%3c "I," which is Malchut, is in exile. Why? "By the river Kevar." Kevar %0a%3c (already) is the river that had already existed, but has now disappeared. As it %0a%3c is written, "The river is destroyed and dried up." It was "destroyed" in the %0a%3c first Temple and "dried up" in the second. Hence, it is written: "He struck %0a%3c and destroyed both, Ariel and Moav." Moav (or Mi Aw) means "from the %0a%3c Heavenly Father." They were all destroyed for Him, and all the Light that %0a%3c shone upon Israel disappeared. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word Kursa, derived from the word Kisse (throne) or Kissuy (cover) %0a%3c signifies the combination of the properties of Malchut and Bina, which leads %0a%3c to the Light descending to BYA during the 6,000 years. The Holy Throne is %0a%3c overthrown, because the screen of Bina (Kisse) has been annulled, as it is said, "I %0a%3c am in exile," where "I" designates Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire spiritual complex is structured like a ladder, where Malchut of %0a%3c the Upper Partzuf becomes (descends to) the Keter of the lower one. This is also %0a%3c indicated in the names: Malchut is called "I" (Ani = Aleph-Nun-Yod) and Keter is %0a%3c called "no" (Ein = Aleph-Yod-Nun), as it is completely unattainable. Only that %0a%3c which is perceived within Malchut can be attained; hence, it is called "I." %0a%3c %0a%3c Only Malckut of the Upper Partzuf acts as a link between the Partzufim: the %0a%3c Upper One makes a Zivug on its Malchut, creates Ohr Hozer, and receives (clothes) %0a%3c the Upper Light within it, and then Malchut of the Upper One descends to the %0a%3c lower Partzuf in the form of Ohr Hozer. This state of the Upper One clothing in %0a%3c the lower one is called the exile of the Upper One, for the Zivug with the Upper %0a%3c Light disappears from it, and the Upper Light disappears from all the Partzufim. %0a%3c And the river dries up— the corrected screen is called the "river," for it causes the %0a%3c Upper Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, now that the screen (river) disappears, the descent of the Upper %0a%3c Light disappears as well. The destruction of the river in the First Temple causes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 248 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the disappearance of Ohr Haya; the river in the Second Temple dries up, and %0a%3c Ohr Neshama vanishes along with it. The river in the First Temple is destroyed %0a%3c because the Zivug in AVI is stopped; the Light in YESHSUT is exhausted, and %0a%3c the river in the Second Temple dries up. %0a%3c %0a%3c The source of Ohr Haya and Neshama is Aba, called the "Heavenly Father," for %0a%3c he shines in ZA, called "Heaven," with the Light that elevates ZON to YESHSUT %0a%3c (the Second Temple) and to AVI (the First Temple). Because the Light stops %0a%3c shining from Guf de Atik, all of the Light descending to Israel disappears. This %0a%3c refers not only to the Light of the two Temples, but to all of the Light shining %0a%3c upon Israel, including Ohr VAK and the Light in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 96. Further, He descended and struck the lion. Initially, when this river %0a%3c rolled its waters down, Israel was in a state of perfection, for they offered %0a%3c up gifts and sacrifices to atone for their sins and to save their souls. Then, the %0a%3c image of a lion would descend from Above, and they would see it on the %0a%3c altar as it trampled the bodies of the sacrifices, devouring them, and all the %0a%3c dogs (all those who slander Israel) would fall to silence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fire that consumes the sacrifices laid on the Temple altar resembled %0a%3c a lion, and towered over the sacrifices, like a lion (Talmud, Yoma, 21:2), and %0a%3c that fire burned the sacrifices laid down by the sons of Israel. However, this is a %0a%3c corporeal image that a regular person perceives in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c But we shall follow our higher analysis and detach ourselves from this %0a%3c corporeal image; we will explain the action in the spiritual world that this %0a%3c language actually alludes to. All the languages in the Torah, including that which %0a%3c describes a rather corporeal image of sacrifice, speak only of spiritual actions. %0a%3c The most precise language for the description of these actions is the language of %0a%3c Kabbalah. However, this language is clear only to those who have ascended to %0a%3c the spiritual worlds and see both the roots, i.e., the events that transpire in the %0a%3c spiritual worlds, as well as their corporeal consequences. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the Light of Atik disappeared, when the Upper Light still shone upon %0a%3c Israel, like a river rolling its waters, Israel was in a state of perfection: by means %0a%3c of sacrifice, it raised its MAN (request), thus evoking a Zivug on its screen, and %0a%3c MAD (the Light, abundance) descends on it. As a result of these actions, it grew %0a%3c closer to the Heavenly Father, and all the impure forces distanced from it, for it %0a%3c purified its souls, and purification signifies distancing from the impure forces %0a%3c (desires), the way a soiled garment is cleansed from dirt. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the Hebrew word for sacrifice is Korban, derived from the word %0a%3c Karov (near). Thus, sacrifice signifies a person tearing away a part of his inner %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 249 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c animal egoism for the sake of drawing closer to the Creator. This is what brings %0a%3c Israel closer to their Heavenly Father. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Israel existed in perfection and raised MAN for the Creator's %0a%3c pleasure alone, its MAN would ascend to Bina. The Light of Bina is called Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, and its form resembles the image of a lion, like the property of bestowal, %0a%3c Hesed. This means that the lion-Bina receives Israel's good desires and deeds. And %0a%3c it was seen how Bina consumes Israel's MAN— Ohr Hassadim descends from Bina %0a%3c onto this MAN, like a lion trampling his prey (MAN) and devouring it. %0a%3c %0a%3c A lion devouring its prey is the principal aspect of sacrifice, for it signifies %0a%3c raising MAN to strengthen a screen and create Ohr Hozer. And since the %0a%3c magnitude of the received Ohr Yashar is determined by the magnitude (height) %0a%3c of Ohr Hozer, which creates the screen, it follows that existence and growth of %0a%3c Ohr Yashar is dependent on the Ohr Hozer. The greater the Ohr Hozer, the greater %0a%3c the descending Ohr Yashar becomes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, to the extent that every one of us desires to "bestow," he %0a%3c evokes a corresponding response from Above, from the root of his soul. And just %0a%3c as in our world a living being's life and strength depend on nutrition (it simply dies %0a%3c without it), the Upper Light depends on the Light reflected by the screen. When it %0a%3c stops, the Upper Light disappears from the Partzuf, i.e., man stops feeling it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light descends from Bina as Ohr Yashar (called a "lion"), i.e., in %0a%3c the form of "bestowal," in accordance with Bina 's nature. And man sees (feels!) %0a%3c how Ohr Yashar clothes in Ohr Hozer, which ascends from its sacrifice (rejection %0a%3c of egoism), the lion's nourishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c It devours its prey and thereby grows: the extent of Israel's perfection and %0a%3c their ability to offer sacrifices, to "bestow," determines the magnitude of their %0a%3c MAN and the force with which the Ohr Yashar strikes the screen, which reflects %0a%3c the Direct Light (pleasure) from below upwards with all its might. Moreover, it %0a%3c does so in great fear: for what if it fails to reflect the Light and desires to enjoy %0a%3c the Light of this commandment selfishly? %0a%3c %0a%3c That is precisely where one's work lies. It is called "faith above reason," for %0a%3c it must rise above one's reason (egoism) and intellect. Conversely, those who %0a%3c ceive inner confidence that it is enough to advance within one's nature ar %0a%3c cred still," a pure inanimate (non-developing) being, as such re %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if the height of Ohr Hozer is great, it is defined as a lion that tears %0a%3c and devours its prey, as a victor, for it grows and ascends to a higher spiritual %0a%3c level thanks to the efforts of the lower one (man). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 250 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure force, the selfish will to receive pleasure is called "a dog," as it %0a%3c is written: "The leech has two daughters (who demand): Give-give." (Mishley, %0a%3c 30:15). They bark like a dog, and demand (to receive) both this world and the %0a%3c next. And the Higher One ascends, the stronger this impure force, called Klipa, %0a%3c becomes. And its strongest part corresponds to Ohr Yechida, opposite the lion %0a%3c devouring its prey). %0a%3c %0a%3c The lion represents mercy and bestowal, unwillingness to receive anything %0a%3c for oneself. As it is written in The Ethics of the Fathers, 95: "A Chassid, the merciful %0a%3c righteous one, says, 'What's yours is yours, and what's mine is yours,'" so is the %0a%3c impure force (dog) aimed wholly at reception, and has no aspiration to bestow. %0a%3c As it is said in the Talmud (Bava Batra, 10:2), "The righteous among the nations %0a%3c of the world: all their mercy is for themselves alone;" hence, they are connected %0a%3c to the impure force of a dog. (Under no circumstances should any of this be %0a%3c interpreted literally, for, as it was repeatedly explained, the whole of the Kabbalah %0a%3c speaks only of man's-prototype. Israel is one's inner aspiration to the Creator, %0a%3c and Goy (a gentile) signifies egoism (regardless of and unrelated to one's origin). %0a%3c Relate this to the above-mentioned corporeal and spiritual Temples, where there %0a%3c is no connection between rocks and spiritual objects. It is also unclear to the %0a%3c uninitiated why altruism is the property of a lion, while a dog, a loyal animal, is %0a%3c the root of egoism and impurity). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that when Israel was perfect, it acquired the property of a %0a%3c lion, and all the dogs left it be, for it gave Malchut the strength to raise Ohr Hozer %0a%3c to great heights (devoured its prey, like a victor), and the impure force, like a %0a%3c dog, was afraid to come near it, and would hide in fear of the lion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 97. Yet, when sins increased, he descended to the lower degrees and slew the %0a%3c lion. This was because the lion refused to give up its prey as before, and this %0a%3c is as though he killed it. Therefore, he struck the lion and threw it into a pit, %0a%3c to the Evil Side (according to his understanding). The Evil Side saw this and %0a%3c sent a dog to devour the sacrifices from the altar in the lion's stead. What is %0a%3c the name of that lion? And what is the nickname of that dog? Baladan is its %0a%3c name; Baladan is formed by the words Bal'Adam, where the letter Mem is %0a%3c replaced by Nun, for he is not a human being at all, but a dog, and his face is %0a%3c like a muzzle of a dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c ("He" refers to Benayahu Ben Yehoyada Ben Ish Chai, Rav Paalim u Mekabtziel, %0a%3c in whom the degree of Atik, all of the Light, shines all at once.) Due to the %0a%3c disappearance of the screens of Malchut (BON) and Bina (SAG), Israel below could %0a%3c no longer raise MAN (the will to "bestow," the screen, the lion's nourishment). %0a%3c The Zivug stopped, and the Upper Light (lion) disappeared in its Root Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 251 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "Threw it into a pit"— the root of the desire to receive for one's own sake %0a%3c is in the eyes, as Rashi said: "The eye sees, and the heart burns with desire" %0a%3c (The weekly portion Shlach). This will to receive for oneself is called an "empty, %0a%3c waterless pit" (Beresheet, 37:24). The Upper Light does not fill it. Although it is %0a%3c empty, it is unworthy of being a vessel for the Light, as it is written: "He and I %0a%3c cannot dwell in the same abode" (Talmud, Suta, 5). %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the lion was thrown into a pit, for it was struck before the eyes of %0a%3c the impure egoistic force, called an "empty, waterless pit." And these pits now %0a%3c emerge from their hideouts and reveal their power, and in place of a lion appears %0a%3c a barking dog. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-MA = 45 is called Adam = Aleph + Dalet + Mem = 1 + 4 + 40 = 45, when %0a%3c he receives the Light from Bina. The property of Bina is bestowal. Hence, it is %0a%3c written: "Man is your name" (Talmud, Yevamot, 61), referring only to those who %0a%3c attain the property of bestowal, but not to the others, of whom it is said: "Even %0a%3c their mercy is only for their profit" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 10:2), and who are %0a%3c therefore called Baladan (Bal-Adan). %0a%3c %0a%3c 98. On a day of snow, on the day misfortunes descend from the Supernal %0a%3c Court Above, it is written, "Her household shall not fear snow," that is, the %0a%3c Supernal Court, called "snow." For her household is clothed twofold, and can %0a%3c thereby endure a strong fire. So the book says. %0a%3c %0a%3c Strictness, judgment (Din) or restriction imposed on the use of egoism in the %0a%3c male part is called "snow" that stems from the Supernal Court. These restrictions %0a%3c are very powerful, but are mitigated below the Chazeh, where Malchut receives %0a%3c them. Nulcva describes these restrictions in the following way: "Surround me %0a%3c with roses," (Shir HaShirim, 2) referring to two fires: the Upper— Bina, and the %0a%3c lower, her own— Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut acquires these two fires, she weakens the strictness of the cold %0a%3c snow with her fire. Hence, it is written in Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) that %0a%3c her household shall not fear snow (the Supernal Court), i.e., the restrictions %0a%3c imposed on the male part, for her household is clothed twofold. In other words, %0a%3c on the contrary, the snow helps her withstand the heat of her fire. And only %0a%3c now that the screen and Zivug are gone, and the two fires are no more, the %0a%3c restrictions of the snow return. %0a%3c %0a%3c 99. What is written next? "And he struck an Egyptian." This refers to a secret: %0a%3c every time Israel sinned, the Creator would conceal Himself and restrict them %0a%3c from receiving all the goodness and all the Light that He shone upon them. %0a%3c "He struck an Egyptian." "He" refers to Moshe, the Light that shines upon %0a%3c Israel. For in Egypt he was born, grew up, and attained the Supernal Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 252 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah speaks not of man, but of the Light that disappeared and %0a%3c concealed itself. Hence, it is defined as "slain." Gone is the great Light, with %0a%3c which Moshe shone upon Israel. And this Light is called the "Egyptian," for %0a%3c in Egypt Moshe was born, grew up, and attained the great Supernal Light, the %0a%3c Light that delivered Israel from Egypt. %0a%3c %0a%3c 100. A man of mirror. It is written, mirror and man, as it is written, a Godly %0a%3c man, the husband of that mirror, of the Creator's glory, Malchut. For with %0a%3c this degree he merited ruling over the entire land in all of his desire— a feat %0a%3c unmatched by any other. %0a%3c %0a%3c The difference between Moshe and the other prophets is that Moshe is the %0a%3c foundation of ZA, as he constructs and passes the Light from ZA to Malchut, %0a%3c whereas the other prophets are the foundation of Malchut, and receive from %0a%3c her. Hence, it is written of him: "Godly man," the husband of Malchut, called %0a%3c the "Creator's greatness." And why is Moshe called the husband of Malchut 7 . %0a%3c Because he attained the level of ZA and gives the Light to Malchut. Therefore, it %0a%3c is written that his attainments are beyond anyone else's, for the other prophets %0a%3c receive from Malchut, and are therefore ruled by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who attains Malchut receives from her. The degree called Moshe means %0a%3c that he who attains it gives the Light to Malchut, instead of receiving from her. %0a%3c Yet, how can this be? How can one possibly rise above Malchut if all our souls %0a%3c originate from her and exist in the worlds of BYA? This indicates the state of %0a%3c ascent above Malchut, which is how Moshe ascends to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c 101. This is the Creator's staff that was delivered to him, as it is written, %0a%3c "With the Creator's staff in my hand." This is the staff that was created on %0a%3c the evening of the sixth day of the creation, before Shabbat. And His Holy %0a%3c Name is contained in it. And with this staff Moshe sinned by striking it %0a%3c twice against the rock. The Creator said to him: "Moshe, it is not for this %0a%3c purpose that I have not given you My staff; thus, it will no longer be in your %0a%3c possession henceforth." %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "evening" and "twilight" signify the state of mitigation of Malchut 's %0a%3c strictness by the properties of Bina to an extent that it becomes impossible to %0a%3c distinguish Malchut from Bina. This is because on Shahhat, Malchut ascends to %0a%3c AVI and becomes Bina. However, on the twilight of Shabbat, Malchut is not %0a%3c yet Bina, but is no longer Malchut (everything in the book speaks only of the %0a%3c properties of spiritual objects, for nothing but desires exists in the spiritual %0a%3c worlds. Only in our world are desires clothed in physical bodies). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 253 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that ten things were created in the twilight, when there is no %0a%3c distinction between the thing itself and its origin, Bina or Malchut, for Malchut %0a%3c herself shows no distinction. And such is the property of the staff that was created %0a%3c in the twilight, before the world's first Shabbat. Hence, it possesses the holy (special) %0a%3c property of the Creator's name, an allusion to the properties of Bina, from which %0a%3c holiness (altruism) descends. And Malchut is ready to receive this holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And these two properties of Bina and Malchut are contained in the Creator's %0a%3c staff, utterly indistinguishable from one another, for they were created in the %0a%3c twilight. Hence, with the help of this staff, i.e., by means of the property of %0a%3c uniting Malchut with Bina, all the fortunes and wonders, all of the Light can be %0a%3c brought to Israel, for this is the purpose behind the Light's descent from Bina %0a%3c to Malchut. With the help of this property (the staff), Moshe merited an ascent %0a%3c to Bina, up to the degree of "Godly man." Therefore, the staff is called the %0a%3c Creator's staff, according to the name of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called Tzur (rock), and upon ascending to Bina, she is called Sela %0a%3c (another name for a rock). The inner Zivug between ZON (ZA and Malchut) in %0a%3c the state of their ascent to AVI, when Nukva uses Ima's Kelim, is called "speech." %0a%3c The outer Zivug between ZON, when they are in their own place, is called "Zivug %0a%3c de Hakaa" (a Zivug by Striking). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written to Moshe in the weekly Torah portion Bashalach: "You %0a%3c shall strike the rock (Tzur), and it shall bring forth water" (Shemot, 17:6), for %0a%3c a Zivug de Hakaa occurs within Malchut herself. However, it is written in the %0a%3c weekly portion Chulcat: "Speak ye unto the rock before all eyes, that it give forth %0a%3c its water" (Bamidbar, 20:8), for the "rock" is in Bina, and the Zivug within her is %0a%3c called "speech." %0a%3c %0a%3c And herein lies the sin of Moshe: he struck twice: in addition to first %0a%3c striking the Tzur, he struck the Sela, which lacks the strike, and only has a %0a%3c Zivug in the form of speech. Since there is no distinction in the Creator's staff, %0a%3c and it is unclear whether it refers to Malchut or to Bina, he also applied it to %0a%3c Sela-Bina. And the Creator told him that the staff was given to him to use with %0a%3c Tzur, but not with Sela. %0a%3c %0a%3c 102. At once He descended to him in strictness and wrenched the staff from %0a%3c the Egyptian's hand, for the moment the staff was taken from him, it was %0a%3c taken for good. And he was killed by it: because of the sin of striking the rock %0a%3c with the staff, he died and did not enter the Holy Land. And that Light was %0a%3c concealed from Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 254 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already mentioned in item 94 that as a result of a great Zivug in %0a%3c Atik, only BON were supposed to disappear, but not SAG, for BON could have %0a%3c immediately risen and forever become like SAG. However, as SAG and BON %0a%3c were merged, SAG disappeared together with BON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Moshe disappeared from Israel for the same reason— because %0a%3c he committed an even greater sin and harmed the union of BON and SAG by %0a%3c striking the Sela. Hence, harsh judgment descended upon him, which refers to %0a%3c the disappearance of the Light of SAG. Indeed, SAG is no longer connected to %0a%3c BON in any way, and the annulment of BON has no influence on it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the meaning of what is written in Psalms: "He resembled those who %0a%3c draw axes at a copse of trees, but now all of his adornments are smashed by %0a%3c hatchets and axes" (Tehilim, 74:5). Due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, and her %0a%3c correction there, Malchut is like a "copse of trees," for SAG, too, is annulled by %0a%3c the merging with BON, Malchut's ascent, as if struck with "hatchets and axes." %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the staff was taken from the Egyptian, and will %0a%3c never return to him, for the staff refers to Malchut. So the Light disappears for %0a%3c good, because BON renews itself afterwards and becomes SAG forever. Thus, it %0a%3c is no longer necessary to use the staff for striking. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in this regard that he was slain by the same staff, for had he %0a%3c been careful and used it only once— striking the Tzur, but not the Sela— SAG %0a%3c would not have been annulled together with BON, and he would not have died. %0a%3c Instead, he would have immediately risen to SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that Moshe shall not enter the Holy Land, Israel, as %0a%3c Israel is BON in the state of ascent to SAG, and it is called the Holy Land, for %0a%3c the Light of Bina (called the Holy Light) shines in it. However, until the end of %0a%3c correction arrives, there are still ascents and descents, which cause destructions %0a%3c (disappearance of the Light) and revelations (shining of the Light). But at the %0a%3c end of correction, BON will remain within SAG permanently as Eretz Israel, and %0a%3c there shall be no more exiles from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 103. "The most respected of the thirty" refers to the Upper One that receives %0a%3c from Above and passes downward, one that receives and brings closer. %0a%3c However, he does not go to the first three, but they come to him and give to %0a%3c him wholeheartedly, but he does not come to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR (HBD) are called "thirty," as each of the three Sefirot HBD consists of %0a%3c ten, which amounts to thirty. And their Light shines in all of the 6,000 years. %0a%3c The soul of Benayahu appears out of the great Zivug of Atik, which accumulates %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c all the Zivugim during the 6,000 years. Hence, it is called Rav Paalim (performing %0a%3c many actions) and Mekabtziel (gathering all into one degree-Part^u/, called %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he receives the Light of all of the Supernal Thirty, which descends %0a%3c to his soul. Indeed, he consists of particular Zivugim that have transpired through %0a%3c the 6,000 years, which he gathers into one. And, although they give him the %0a%3c best of their properties wholeheartedly, he still cannot draw closer to them and %0a%3c subsequently receive from them. This is because the disappearance of the screen %0a%3c in ZON made the screen in SAG disappear as well. Hence, he cannot come to %0a%3c them, raise MAN, and receive from them further. %0a%3c %0a%3c 104. Despite not being considered one of them, David heard the meaning %0a%3c that is never detached from the heart, for they can never be separated. David %0a%3c paid attention with all his heart, but he did not pay attention to David. For by %0a%3c the praises, hymns, and mercy that the moon offers the sun, the moon draws %0a%3c the sun closer so as to be with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c David is Malchut; Malchut comes from the word Melech (King). Therefore, %0a%3c David is King, for his properties are the properties of Malchut (kingdom). %0a%3c And this is the fourth leg (support) of GAR. Hence, it is written that although %0a%3c he cannot be together with the thirty (GAR), he nonetheless clings to these %0a%3c properties, and never detaches himself from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because Malchut's entire perfection is revealed in him, for it stems %0a%3c from the great Zivug of Atik, which destroys all the impure forces of BON, as it is %0a%3c said: "He destroys evil forever." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, David resolved to never part with it again, for it is his perfection. %0a%3c However, Benayahu Ben Yehoyada paid no attention to David, as David is the %0a%3c fourth support of GAR. Hence, it is as though he is unable to receive from GAR. %0a%3c And since he cannot receive from David, he pays no attention to him. %0a%3c %0a%3c With the help of the MAN of Malchut (called Se'ara— stormy wind), which %0a%3c is raised to ZA (called "Heaven"), as a result of the hymns, praises, and mercy, %0a%3c Malchut receives the Light of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada's soul, which is absolute %0a%3c perfection, and merges with it for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c 105. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell down on their faces before him and could %0a%3c not see him anymore, then rose and went in every direction, but could not %0a%3c see him. They sat and wept, and could not even speak to one another. Then, %0a%3c Rabbi Aba said, "It is true what we have learned, that the Torah accompanies %0a%3c the righteous on all their paths. The righteous of the other world come to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 256 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c them to reveal to them the secrets of the Torah. And this must have been %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, who came to us from the other world to reveal these %0a%3c secrets to us. But before we could recognize him, he vanished." They rose and %0a%3c wanted to lead their donkeys on, but could not. They repeatedly tried to goad %0a%3c the donkeys, but still they could not move. They grew frightened and left their %0a%3c donkeys behind. And to this day this place is called "the place of donkeys." %0a%3c %0a%3c Because they could not bear such a powerful Light, which was revealed to %0a%3c them upon the disclosure of those secrets, they fell (Katnut) and then rose (Gadlut), %0a%3c for it was so unbearable. After they merited receiving from it such a great degree, %0a%3c this Light disappeared at once and did not reappear, and they could not attain it %0a%3c anymore. Hence, they wept (a kind of Katnut) out of great grief that they had lost %0a%3c such exalted attainment, and they could not speak (absence of Kelim). %0a%3c %0a%3c The bitterness of their loss made them realize that it was the degree of %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba himself, and not lower, as they had mistakenly thought %0a%3c before. The forces that they received from the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba are %0a%3c called "donkeys," with which they can raise MAN, the request to attain Higher %0a%3c Degrees, Haya and Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, the soul is a spiritual force of Light; like a pulling force of %0a%3c a donkey that helps overcome egoistic desires and move from place to place in %0a%3c the spiritual world, onto a Higher Degree. To raise MAN means to feel what is %0a%3c lacking and what needs to be attained— this is what man's work is all about. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the work of a righteous soul— it helps man by lifting him up onto %0a%3c his donkey (egoism) and taking the lead (pulling) in order to illuminate (give %0a%3c strength) for him the path of the righteous. And now, when its role has been %0a%3c completed, this soul disappears, although they would have very much liked to %0a%3c continue ascending and riding its donkeys, i.e., they wished to raise MAN anew %0a%3c to return and attain once more. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, they could no longer receive the strength to raise MAN. Thus, %0a%3c they were struck by fear and left their donkeys in that place, which is hence %0a%3c called "the place of donkeys," for they could not use them any longer. %0a%3c %0a%3c 106. Rabbi Elazar opened and said: "Oh, how great is Your goodness, which %0a%3c You have hidden away for those who fear You! (Tehilim, 31:20). How infinite %0a%3c is the goodness that the Creator shall bestow on humankind in the future, %0a%3c on those sin-fearing, exalted righteous, who study the Torah as they arrive %0a%3c at that Upper World." %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "great goodness" refer to Gadlut, the attainment of the Light of %0a%3c GAR. For the basis of a Partzuf is its VAK— the amount of Light necessary for its %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 257 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c existence, received from the Zivug of AVI, who make this Zivug and emit Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, necessary to sustain the worlds. And all the extra Light, necessary %0a%3c for existence, is called GAR or Ohr Hochma— the additional, delectable and %0a%3c great Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Ohr Hochma, the Light of GAR, stems from Bina, which is called "the %0a%3c world to come." It is clothed in Ohr Hassadim that emerges from a Zivug of the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod (Chai Olamim— life of the worlds), and from there descends to the %0a%3c righteous who fear to sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zivug of AVI, when they are at the degree of Bina, gives Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c to ZA for the sustenance of the worlds. However, when AVI ascend to AA and %0a%3c beget new souls by their Zivug, their Zivug is inconstant, as it emits Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c called "new souls." %0a%3c %0a%3c 107. The name "great goodness" can be further described as containing all %0a%3c the secrets of the Supernal wisdom, which descend from ZA to Malchut. %0a%3c There is a great tree, called ZA or Rav (great, strong), and there is a small tree, %0a%3c Malchut, which grows from it. And it is elevated to the Highest Firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the attainment of the Light of GAR, there is also the inner %0a%3c part of the Supernal wisdom with its secrets, which become revealed in the %0a%3c Zivug of Atik at the completion of the 6,000 years, the end of correction. MA %0a%3c designates the lower world, Malchut. The great and strong tree is ZA in the state %0a%3c of ascent to Partzuf AB, as in this state he receives Ohr Hochma, and Hochma %0a%3c signifies strength (not "reason— strength" but the strength of Ohr Hochma lies in %0a%3c the fact that it allows one to go against reason, in defiance of common sense, in %0a%3c faith above reason). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when ZA is in his place, he is simply called "a tree," for he lacks %0a%3c Ohr Hochma and has only VAK, Ohr Hassadim. Malchut is also called a tree and %0a%3c grows together with ZA; ZA ascends to Aba, to the utmost height, to the Supernal %0a%3c Firmament— Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c 108. The "great goodness" is the Light that was created on the first day of %0a%3c creation and concealed so as to be revealed in the future for the righteous %0a%3c in the other world. Your Deeds are the Supernal Garden of Eden, which the %0a%3c Creator has created by His act. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that was created on the first day of creation is the Light in which %0a%3c Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. Hence, the word "Light" is %0a%3c used five times in the Torah's description of the first day of creation. This Light is %0a%3c intended for the righteous in the world to come, for it is concealed in Yesod de Aha %0a%3c and in Yesod de Ima, which are collectively called "righteousness and justice." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 258 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (In Hebrew, the words Tzedek— justice and Tzadik— righteous/just have the %0a%3c same root. This name is given to one who attains the Creator's governance and %0a%3c sees that His governance is just; hence, he justifies all of the Creator's actions, %0a%3c and is thus called righteous. The other meaning of the word 'righteous' refers to %0a%3c man's belief that the Creator is righteous, because in spirituality, one assumes the %0a%3c name of the degree one has attained. If he attains that the Creator is righteous %0a%3c by receiving this knowledge from the degree onto which he ascends, then he is %0a%3c already called by the name of that degree.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hochma can be received only in "precious garments," called %0a%3c righteousness and justice, that is, only with these intentions. The above excerpt %0a%3c speaks of an open action, implying unrestricted diffusion of Light, as it will %0a%3c be after the end of all the corrections. In the Torah, such a state is called "the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden." %0a%3c %0a%3c In the meantime, only the complete and perfect righteous ones, the souls %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada and others that merited reception of Light from the %0a%3c great Zivug of Atik, gather all the Light of the 6,000 years. These souls' place of %0a%3c rest is referred to as the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exists the lower Garden of Eden of earth, which is VAK, and the %0a%3c Supernal one, GAR. All the souls dwell in the lower Garden of Eden, and only %0a%3c on new moons and Sabbaths do they ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden, %0a%3c and then return to their place. However, there are individual, special persons %0a%3c (souls), whose place is in the Supernal Garden of Eden. These are the souls of %0a%3c which Rabbi Shimon says: "I saw them ascending, but their numbers were few." %0a%3c %0a%3c 109. All the righteous stand in the lower Garden of Eden, clothed in precious %0a%3c adornments, similar in quality and form to those which they wore in this %0a%3c world, meaning in the same form as people in this world and according to %0a%3c man's actions in this world. They stand there and fly away through the air, %0a%3c ascend to the Assembly in the Supernal Garden of Eden, fly there and bathe %0a%3c in the dew of the pure river of Apharsemon (persimmon), then come down %0a%3c and fly below in the lower Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c The main difference between GAR and ZAT with regard to both Partzufim %0a%3c and souls is that GAR (KHB) do not need the garment of Hassadim. They can %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma as it is. However, Partzufim of VAK and the souls born %0a%3c from ZON, whose basis is VAK (Ohr Hochma clothed in Ohr Hassadim), can only %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma when it is clothes in Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ruach de Tzadikim (spirit of the righteous) in the lower Garden of Eden %0a%3c is clothed in Ohr Hassadim, just as human souls in this world. And with the help %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 259 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of these precious garments, they can ascend to the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c and there receive Ohr Hochma. Afterwards, they return to their place in the %0a%3c lower Garden of Eden, for that is their permanent place. %0a%3c %0a%3c They ascend by the power of Ohr Hassadim, called "air," and fly to the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden to receive Ohr Hochma, called the river of Apharsemon. %0a%3c However, they cannot stay there, so they immediately descend from the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden to the lower. The Zohar compares them to human souls, for %0a%3c both the Upper and the lower human souls need to receive the garment of Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim in order to correct themselves and ascend. %0a%3c %0a%3c 110. And sometimes these righteous appear as people in order to perform %0a%3c miracles, like celestial angels, just as we have seen the luminescence of the %0a%3c Upper Light, but did not merit to see and discover the wisdom's great secrets. %0a%3c %0a%3c DID NOT MERIT TO DISCOVER THE WISDOM'S GREAT SECRETS- %0a%3c for the donkey driver had left them and disappeared. There are special souls %0a%3c that abide in the Supernal Garden of Eden. They have risen so high that the %0a%3c souls from the lower Garden of Eden ascend to them only on new moons %0a%3c and Sabbaths, and, being unable to stay there, immediately descend to their %0a%3c permanent place. However, they are nonetheless similar to human souls, which %0a%3c descend from the Supernal Garden of Eden to this world and meet people, just %0a%3c like the angels that seldom descend to this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now they have seen the Light of the Supernal Luminary, the Light of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba that descended on them from the highest point, the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden, and was revealed before them in this world (while they are still %0a%3c living in this world). %0a%3c %0a%3c AS PEOPLE refers to the souls that abide in the lower Garden of Eden, %0a%3c which have the form of people, and the Light of the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c influences them. They can receive this Light during their ascent on new moons %0a%3c and Sabbaths, whereupon they merit meeting the souls of the Supernal Garden %0a%3c of Eden, and then descend to their permanent place. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one may also say that the words AS PEOPLE refer to the people %0a%3c of our corporeal world, while the souls from the Supernal Garden of Eden %0a%3c sometimes descend to this world and, like exalted angels, appear before the eyes %0a%3c of the righteous. %0a%3c %0a%3c 111. Rabbi Aba opened and said: "And he who is doomed said to his wife, %0a%3c 'We shall die, for I have seen the Creator.' Even though he was not aware of %0a%3c his actions, as it is written, 'He did not know that it was an angel'; however, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 260 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c since it is written, 'Man shall not see Me and live,' we know that he has %0a%3c died. And we have merited this great Light to accompany us, and the world %0a%3c exists because the Creator Himself sent him to us, to reveal the secrets of His %0a%3c Supernal wisdom to us. How joyous is our share!" %0a%3c %0a%3c When the angel saw him who was doomed, he did not yet have the proper %0a%3c level of attainment; thus, the angel was unwilling to reveal his name. Yet, %0a%3c although he did not know and did not attain him, he still feared the words, %0a%3c "Man shall not see Me and live" (Shemot, 33:20). %0a%3c %0a%3c But we have merited complete attainment, for we came to know his name, %0a%3c Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And we live and exist in this world. It is therefore clear %0a%3c that the degree of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba is called "Show me Your glory" (Shemot, %0a%3c 33:18), Moshe's request of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator replied: "You cannot see My face, for man shall not see Me %0a%3c and live." From this we see that they have attained more than Moshe. This state %0a%3c is described by sages as, "There was no prophet more exalted than Moshe, but %0a%3c there was a sage" (Yalkut Shimoni, the end). It is also written: "A sage is preferred %0a%3c to a prophet" (Talmud, Bava Batra, 12:1). Thus, they have spiritually ascended to %0a%3c merit the appearance of such an exalted soul, while still being in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 112. They walked and came to a mountain. The sun had set. The branches %0a%3c of the tree on that mountain started rattling and singing. As they were still %0a%3c walking, they heard a resounding voice proclaim, "Sons of the Holy Creator, %0a%3c dispersed among the living in this world, illuminated by the sons of the %0a%3c Assembly, gather in your places and rejoice with your Creator in the Torah." %0a%3c They grew frightened and stopped, then sat down. %0a%3c %0a%3c "They came to a mountain" refers to the words of King David, who said %0a%3c (Tehilim, 24:3): "Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord, and who shall %0a%3c stand in His holy place?" meaning who is worthy of it? After they climbed %0a%3c the mountain, the sun had set (the Light left the Partzuf). But they heard %0a%3c something from the trees, as it is written: "Then shall all the trees of the wood %0a%3c sing for joy" (Tehilim, 96:12). %0a%3c %0a%3c They heard a voice that told them to return to their place, rejoice in the %0a%3c Creator and His Torah, and descend from the mountain. And it calls them by %0a%3c the name of that High Degree, which they've achieved. But it hints that people %0a%3c are not worthy of being at that degree and in this world simultaneously. Yet, %0a%3c although they were frightened, they remained on the mountain, sat down, and %0a%3c did not move. "Grew frightened," "stopped," and "sat down" are the spiritual %0a%3c states of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 261 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c We see how The Zohar explains the path of the righteous, those who cross %0a%3c the Machsom (the barrier that separates our world from the spiritual) and start %0a%3c ascending the rungs of the spiritual ladder. This path is diverse, and each book %0a%3c of the Torah describes it in its own way: the language of Kabbalah, legends, %0a%3c judicial laws, historical accounts of the Pentateuch, etc.. The Zohar draws a vivid %0a%3c picture for us— like a guidebook for those who will find themselves in the place %0a%3c of these exalted travelers in the spiritual world. Once there, you will see for %0a%3c yourselves what is implied by such notions as "mountain," "tree," and "voice." %0a%3c Then The Zohar will become your true guidebook! %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to provide a more detailed description of the Partzufim, i.e., %0a%3c an inner perception of one who ascends spiritually. This is because the reader %0a%3c must first have certain analogous sensations of his own. If one could see only %0a%3c once what the described content (or something similar) really means, one would %0a%3c be able to clearly imagine what it speaks of. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is the same in our world: even if we have never been to a certain country, %0a%3c we can imagine what others describe to us by analogy with what we already %0a%3c know. But in this case, there is no analogy. One who sees the spiritual world %0a%3c for the first time realizes how wrong all of his previous visualizations have been! %0a%3c Hence, we can say nothing about many of the states described in The Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 113. Meanwhile, a voice called out again, "O, mighty rocks, great hammers of %0a%3c thunder, Bina stands upon a pillar, so enter and assemble." At that moment, %0a%3c they heard the mighty voice of thousands of trees, which was saying, "The %0a%3c Creator's voice breaks the cedars." Both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba fell %0a%3c down on their faces. Great fear fell upon them. They rose hastily and left, not %0a%3c hearing anything else, then came down the mountain and kept on walking. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was previously said that they could not load their donkeys, meaning that %0a%3c they were unable to raise MAN, because Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba had already %0a%3c completed his helping mission. This is why they lost the power of their donkeys, %0a%3c and could not continue using them to raise MAN and merit Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Elazar said earlier that they did not merit seeing and %0a%3c attaining the secrets of the Supernal wisdom. The fact is that after they attained %0a%3c the level of Yechida, i.e., revealed the soul of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada with the %0a%3c help of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the disappearance of the screen (Masach) of BON %0a%3c caused the loss of Masach de SAG. Hence, they could no longer raise MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light stopped descending to them from Guf de Atik specifically to %0a%3c give them the opportunity, or rather the strength to recreate Masach de SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 262 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, BON will become like SAG, they will resume raising MAN, and %0a%3c will once more be able to ascend from degree to degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, as soon as both Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba left their donkeys, %0a%3c they lost strength to raise MAN in order to bring BON back to the level of SAG. %0a%3c However, the voice proclaimed that they are as strong as rock and thunder, for %0a%3c so far they have endured all the trials. And they will gather strength to endure %0a%3c the mighty rocks and to overcome all the obstacles as before, until they obliterate %0a%3c these obstacles, like great hammers of thunder crashing down from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina, though herself colorless, is called "the source of colors." This is because %0a%3c she is all mercy, whereas all the other properties originate specifically from her %0a%3c by enduring all the trials, like rocks. From all this, Bina receives new forms, %0a%3c hence she received the powers of a new screen onto which emerge all the new %0a%3c degrees and Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Together with the voice that informed them of Bina 's new powers, they %0a%3c heard another voice, "The Creator's voice breaks the cedars" (Tehilim, 29:5), %0a%3c which let them know that all the cedars (obstacles) on their path to higher %0a%3c attainments have been removed. This gave them strength to climb down the %0a%3c mountain and continue their path onto Higher Degrees. %0a%3c %0a%3c 114. Upon reaching the house of Rabbi Yosi, the son of Rabbi Shimon %0a%3c Ben Yosi Ben Lakunya, they saw Rabbi Shimon BarYochai. They rejoiced. %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon rejoiced, too. He said to them, "You have traveled this path %0a%3c of Heavenly signs and wonders correctly, for as I was sleeping, I saw you and %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada, who was sending you two crowns with an old man, %0a%3c so as to adorn you. I am certain that the Creator was on this path too, because %0a%3c I see how your faces have changed." Rabbi Yosi said, "Truly, it is said that a %0a%3c sage is preferred to a prophet." Rabbi Elazar came and put his head on the %0a%3c knees of his father, Rabbi Shimon, and told him of what had happened. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar gives an allegorical explanation of two states: first, they merited %0a%3c attaining the Light of SAG (called Rabbi Yosi) once more, and secondly, now %0a%3c SAG and AB join in a constant Zivug. We see this from their meeting with Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon, who signifies Ohr Hochma. In other words, they merited their BON %0a%3c returning and becoming like SAG in its constant and eternal Zivug with AB. %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu Ben Yehoyada sent them two crowns through Rabbi Hamnuna- %0a%3c Saba: Ohr Yechida, called Benayahu Ben Yehoyada himself, and a new Light AB- %0a%3c SAG, which they have just attained. This Light also came to them by the powers %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben Yehoyada as a reward for overcoming all the trials, thanks to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 263 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c which they, of all others, merited this degree, which is emanated from the great %0a%3c Light of his soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it follows that he sent them two crowns. However, all these descents %0a%3c on their spiritual path were not failures; rather, the Creator Himself was %0a%3c leading them to that High Degree, which they have now attained. This is why %0a%3c it is written: I AM CERTAIN THAT THE CREATOR WAS ON THIS PATH %0a%3c (with you). However, HOW YOUR FACES HAVE CHANGED, for you have %0a%3c attained something else, described by the phrase, A SAGE IS PREFERRED %0a%3c TO A PROPHET. %0a%3c %0a%3c 115. Rabbi Shimon was frightened and wept. He said, "I have heard the %0a%3c Creator and I am awed." This verse was spoken by the prophet Havakuk %0a%3c (Habakkuk), when he saw his death and his resurrection by Elisha. Why was %0a%3c he named Havakuk? Because it is written that at around this time there would %0a%3c be a HOWEK-ET-a son will be embraced. For Havakuk was the son of the %0a%3c Shunamit. And there were two embraces: one from the mother and one from %0a%3c Elisha, as it is written, "He put his mouth to his." %0a%3c %0a%3c First, it is unclear how the prophet Elisha could pass a seed in his blessing %0a%3c to the Shunamit, for this seed cannot exist (procreate). Indeed, Elisha was the %0a%3c greatest prophet after Moshe and his soul came from the Supernal Garden of %0a%3c Eden. Hence, his BON (in Hebrew, the words Ben— son and BON are spelled the %0a%3c same way: Bet-Nun) was already absolutely pure and perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when he passed his son to her, he tied him to the male side, %0a%3c whereas he tied Havakuk only to the female side. And since the female side, %0a%3c Nukva, is closer to the impure force, it clung itself to him, and he died. Thus, %0a%3c the reason for his death lies in the exalted level of the prophet, for his BON is %0a%3c pure and free from the clinging of impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the prophet prayed: "The Creator has hidden it from me and had not %0a%3c told me!" (Melachim II, 4:27). In other words, he had not the slightest clue that he %0a%3c could die by being connected only to BON. That is why it was necessary to return, %0a%3c revive, and attach him to the Upper World, to the resurrection of the dead. %0a%3c %0a%3c The essence of the embryo is the white (Ohr Hochma) in it, as it is written %0a%3c (Talmud, Nidah, 31:1) that Aha (father) is Hochma, for Hochma is called %0a%3c "white," as it is said, "He made everything with Hochma (wisdom)" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 104). However, there is also a need for clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the intention %0a%3c "for the Creator's sake," as it is impossible to receive Ohr Hochma, the Light %0a%3c of Wisdom, attainment and delight, without the clothing of Ohr Hassadim, %0a%3c without an altruistic intention. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 264 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So the mother must provide the red, the screen, which provides Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, required for the clothing of Ohr Hochma in it. As a result of the Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim embracing (clothing, enveloping) Ohr Hochma in itself, an embryo can %0a%3c exist. And here the embryo's entire embrace came only from the mother, the %0a%3c Shunamit, i.e., only from the female side (BON). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when Elisha revived him, he gave him the white (Hochma) and the %0a%3c red (Hassadim) once more. It follows that it was Elisha himself who embraced %0a%3c him the second time. It is hence said that there were two Havakuks (from the %0a%3c word Hihuk— embrace): one from the mother and the other from Elisha. %0a%3c %0a%3c 116. 1 have discovered in the book of King Solomon that the name Havakuk %0a%3c consists of seventy-two names. Elisha created it with words. Each word consists %0a%3c of three letters, for the letters of the alphabet that the Father confirmed to him %0a%3c initially flew away when he died. But Elisha embraced him and confirmed in %0a%3c him all these letters in his seventy-two names. In all, there are 216 letters in his %0a%3c seventy-two names, three letters in each. %0a%3c %0a%3c The embryo is built of 216 = RYU (Reish = 200 + Yod =10 + Vav = 6) letters, %0a%3c designating Ohr Hochma, which descends to YESHSUT. This means that the %0a%3c embryo has RYU letters, which amounts to the Gematria of RE'IYAH = Reish- %0a%3c Aleph-Yod'Hey, i.e., the Light of vision. Re'iyah means vision in Hebrew, and %0a%3c vision is possible only in Ohr Hochma, for "seeing" means "attaining," and the %0a%3c Light of the eyes is the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a growing Partzuf attains Gadlut, receives the clothing of Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World from AVI, and RYU clothe in Ohr Hassadim, this Partzuf is %0a%3c called AB (72) names, as each three letters join into one and RYU = 216 letters %0a%3c turn into AB = seventy-two groups with three letters in each group, or AB = %0a%3c seventy-two names. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Ohr Hassadim, the clothing of the Partzuf, comes only from the lower %0a%3c world, it is defined as RYU = 216 letters. And when it attains AB, Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World, each three letters form a group, and this results in AB = %0a%3c seventy-two names, as it is written, HE CONFIRMED IN HIM ALL THESE %0a%3c LETTERS. When Elisha revived Havakuk, the son of the Shunamit, he created %0a%3c the name Havakuk, AB = seventy-two letters from RYU = 216, for he gave him %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim of the Upper World from AB. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of it, all 216 letters made groups of three and formed three lines %0a%3c from Above downwards: right, left and middle. A cell made of three letters— the %0a%3c right, left, and middle lines, situated horizontally (referring to the same screen %0a%3c and type of Kli)— is regarded as one. Therefore, AB (seventy-two) letters is used %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 265 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c instead of AB (seventy-two) names, because each letter is considered to include %0a%3c three, merged into one. When Ohr Hochma enters these seventy-two cells, the %0a%3c Partzuf is called AB and is said to have the complete Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c One cell. In all, there are 72 %0a%3c such 3-letter cells (names) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim is the Light that brings peace in the state of the Partzuf at a %0a%3c given moment, for its property is not to wish anything for itself, but to bestow. %0a%3c However, Ohr Hassadim received from the lower world is merely comfort "for %0a%3c want of something better," whereas Ohr Hassadim received from the Upper World %0a%3c creates such a powerful property of "bestowal" that the Partzuf receives Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c thereby showing that although it has Ohr Hochma, it still prefers Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to a person in our world, who says that he needs nothing. Yet, %0a%3c there is a distinction: does he say this in a state when he has nothing and can %0a%3c have everything he wants, but still wishes to restrict himself to bare essentials %0a%3c and to give away the rest? %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when the growing Partzuf (the son— BON) had only Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c from the lower world, it could not receive Ohr Hochma in it, and was thus called %0a%3c RYU letters. But since the impure forces still cling to them and tempt the Partzuf %0a%3c to receive Ohr Hochma for itself, Ohr Hochma cannot be clothed within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c These RYU letters that Havakuk had since the day of his birth FLEW AWAY %0a%3c WHEN HE DIED. Hence, it was essential to give him RYU letters and AB %0a%3c names once more. And Elisha did just that by HIS SPIRIT, for he was obliged %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 266 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to recreate in him RYU letters in order to combine them into AB cells with %0a%3c the help of the Upper Hassadim (combine everything into three lines), when %0a%3c everything unites into AB names. %0a%3c %0a%3c 117. Elisha confirmed all of these letters in the soul of Havakuk so as to revive %0a%3c him by the letters of the seventy-two names. And he called him Havakuk, for that %0a%3c is his complete name, which describes all of his properties, as it alludes to two %0a%3c Havakuks and to the 216 letters of the Holy Name, as the Qematria (numerical %0a%3c value) of the name Havakuk is 216, from which the seventy-two names were %0a%3c formed. By AB names he revived him and brought his spirit back, and by RYU %0a%3c letters he revived his body and let it live. This is why he is called Havakuk. %0a%3c %0a%3c Havakuk = Chet + Bet + Kuf + Vav + Kuf = 8 + 2 + 100 + 6 + 100 = 216. %0a%3c The word Havakuk indicates two embraces (Hibukim, plural for Hibuk). Like %0a%3c all Hebrew names, it refers to the property of its bearer. For instance, Yaakov %0a%3c is derived from "Akev" ("got around" Esav), and Avraham signifies Av —father, %0a%3c Am— of the nation). %0a%3c %0a%3c The first embrace came from Ima, but it did not yet allow Ohr Hochma into %0a%3c the Partzuf, into RYU letters, for the impure force clings to the red in Ima. But %0a%3c then Elisha embraced him with Hassadim of the Upper World that came from %0a%3c AVI. This united the letters into groups (names), and Ohr Hochma entered and %0a%3c filled these names permanently, since the impure force cannot cling to Hassadim %0a%3c of the Upper World. %0a%3c %0a%3c As in the above example, even if all the Ohr Hochma were to be offered, the %0a%3c Partzuf, upon receiving protection in the form of a desire for Hassadim of the %0a%3c Upper World, receives such great strength (desire) to bestow that it never wants %0a%3c Hochma. This is precisely why Hochma can fill it for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the name Havakuk denotes two Chihukim (embraces): one from %0a%3c the mother and one from Elisha, thereby imparting him with perfection from all %0a%3c sides: from both the Ohr Hochma and the Ohr Hassadim. "Embraces" signify Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim that stems from AVI, and Ohr Hochma received within Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c is called "the secrets of RYU." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that HE REVIVED HIS SPIRIT BY AB NAMES AND %0a%3c HIS BODY BY RYU LETTERS. And he was revived by Elisha's embrace, for %0a%3c RYU letters had formed names, that is, the three lines, in which Ohr Hochma %0a%3c could be received, thanks to the reception of Ohr Hassadim from AVI (the %0a%3c Upper World). %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces (man's egoistic desires) cannot attack in this Light. %0a%3c Hence, death (the result of receiving Ohr Hochma for oneself) does not exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 267 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, he receives Ohr Hochma, which yields the complete correction %0a%3c of his Guf. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Partzuf '(son of the Shunamit) had RYU letters from the moment %0a%3c of birth, and they left him when he died. Then why is he called Havakuk (two %0a%3c embraces)? After all, the first embrace of Ima (mother) left him the moment %0a%3c of his death, and Elisha revived him from death by embracing him only once. %0a%3c Thus, does he not contain only the embrace of Elisha? %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that Elisha has given him nothing new at the time of resurrection, %0a%3c except for the embrace, the Light from the Supernal Ima— SAG, whose Light %0a%3c evokes the resurrection of the dead. And RYU letters were simply revived by his %0a%3c lower mother— BON. These are the same RYU of BON with which he was born. %0a%3c Otherwise, it would have been an entirely new soul, of which one would not %0a%3c have been able to say that it was dead and then resurrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, now he truly has two embraces, for the first one has now been %0a%3c revived as well, when BON ascended to SAG. And since BON is in the place of %0a%3c SAG, his Hassadim are regarded as those of the Supernal Mother. They completely %0a%3c neutralize the impure forces and death, for their properties (desires) are only of %0a%3c bestowal, which the impure force cannot bear. Thus, they can no longer tempt %0a%3c man. This is why he is called Havakuk, after the action of the two embraces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 118. He said, "I have heard the Creator and I am awed by His Name." I %0a%3c have heard of what I had and have had a taste of the other world at the %0a%3c moment of death, before Elisha resurrected him, and I am awed. He began %0a%3c asking for mercy for his soul. He said, "O, Creator, the deeds that You %0a%3c have performed for me throughout the years were my life." And whoever %0a%3c connects to the past years (the name of the Sefirot of Atik), connects to life. %0a%3c Throughout the years, bestow life upon the degree that has no life of its %0a%3c own, upon Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c His fear comes from the past, previous states, for now he has become perfect %0a%3c on all his sides, and therefore fear has no place. This fear remained from the past, %0a%3c when he left the world. This describes the state between death and resurrection. %0a%3c However, he continues receiving fear from the past state, so it would help him %0a%3c create a screen for raising MAN. It is precisely this fear from past times (states) %0a%3c that stimulates him to raise MAN (request for mercy). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the secret of the future screen, after BON becomes SAG. For then %0a%3c "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8), and there will be no force %0a%3c evoking fear of death and suffering or able to cause harm to one's purity and %0a%3c holiness. Hence, there will be no need to shun, no one to beware of or avoid. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 268 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c So if one has attained such an exalted spiritual state, where could he possibly %0a%3c acquire fear? After all, he will not be able to ascend without it! Only if he takes %0a%3c fear from his past states! For the Partzuf retains the memories, records, recollec- %0a%3c tions of past states, even after its ascent to SAG, when BON become like SAG. %0a%3c %0a%3c If not for the recollections of fear from the past states, the Partzuf would %0a%3c not have been able to create a screen in a state when it has nothing left to fear. %0a%3c While explaining this, Rabbi Shimon told them of Havakuk, to teach them how %0a%3c to acquire fear, just as Havakuk did by taking fear from the past. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE DEEDS THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMED... THROUGHOUT %0a%3c THE YEARS... WERE MY LIFE-because he lived through two periods: the %0a%3c years preceding his death and the years following his resurrection. Between %0a%3c these two periods, there was a state of exiting this world, death (during which %0a%3c he existed in the other world). That is to say, because I remember the time of %0a%3c my death, I thereby connect to life of the Upper World, which Elisha bestowed %0a%3c by resurrecting me. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZATde Atik is called the "past (sometimes ancient) years," since they receive %0a%3c their Light from Malchut of the world of AK, Malchut of Tzimtzum Aleph. %0a%3c However, ZAT de Atik do not shine upon the lower Partzufim and worlds with %0a%3c their Light of Tzimtzum Aleph. ZAT de Atik shine downward during the 6,000 %0a%3c years with diminished Light, restricting it according to the laws of Tzimtzum Bet. %0a%3c Only at the end of correction will they begin to pass down all of their Light. It is %0a%3c written in the Torah that the Light that Atik had passed during the 6,000 years %0a%3c is designated with the small letter Hey in the word Avraham. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, because Havakuk's death has purified him completely, since at the %0a%3c end of correction he merited merging with the "past years" of Atik, he received %0a%3c the required strength in Elisha's embraces and resurrection. It is hence written %0a%3c that after he has purified himself and felt fear at the moment of his death, the %0a%3c power of this fear enabled him to establish contact with ZAT de Atik and receive %0a%3c the Light called "eternal life." %0a%3c %0a%3c For having purified himself through death, BON received complete %0a%3c correction, upon ascending and becoming SAG at the time of death. Subsequently, %0a%3c it reaches the degree of Malchut de Malchut, a Zivug on which can only be made %0a%3c at the end of correction, and attains this degree, the Light of his life. %0a%3c %0a%3c 119. Rabbi Shimon wept and said: "And I have seen from the Creator what %0a%3c I have heard." He raised his hands above his head, and said: "But you have %0a%3c merited seeing Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, the Light of the Torah, face to face, %0a%3c while I have not." He fell on his face and saw him who uproots mountains and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Donkey Driver %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 269 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lights candles in the Temple of the King (Mashiach). He said to him, "Rabbi, %0a%3c in the other world we shall be neighbors with the heads of the assemblies %0a%3c before the Creator." From here on, he called his son Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi %0a%3c Aba by the name Pnei'el (the face of God), as it is written: "For I have seen %0a%3c the Creator face to face." %0a%3c %0a%3c He praised himself for using the same fear from the past, just like Proph- %0a%3c et Havakuk. %0a%3c %0a%3c All corrections are already ready and waiting in the hall of the King %0a%3c (Mashiach), down to the very last detail. They must all be revealed at the end of %0a%3c all corrections, with the appearance of the King. And the souls in that hall are %0a%3c those who merited completion of their individual corrections, for there is an %0a%3c individual correction and a general one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut is the only creation, and it is divided into parts called %0a%3c souls. These parts merge with people of our world, and each of them, while %0a%3c existing within man, must attain one's own correction, i.e., gradually replace %0a%3c one's properties (desires) with those of the Creator. This is considered the soul's %0a%3c individual or personal correction. So then, the souls that have attained their %0a%3c individual correction reach and exist in the state called "abiding in the hall of %0a%3c the King-Mashiach." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light in that hall (the Light of the Torah), also called Hamnuna-Saba, %0a%3c completely liberates man from the impure forces, i.e., purifies him from all his %0a%3c primordial egoistic desires and corrects Malchut de Malchut, which "appears to %0a%3c the righteous as a high mountain" (Talmud, Sota, 52). This correction is made %0a%3c by creating a new SAG-like screen with the purpose of raising MAN (the request %0a%3c for final correction). MAN is called Me'orei Esh (sparkles of fire), as it is written: %0a%3c "Man's soul is the Creator's candle" (Mishley, 20:27). %0a%3c %0a%3c The light of the sun designates the Light's descent, MAD, just as sunlight %0a%3c descends upon us from Above, whereas a fire's flame signifies Ohr Hozer %0a%3c that rises from below upwards, like candlelight. The Zohar therefore says that %0a%3c these two corrections, aimed at destroying the impure forces and ascending to %0a%3c light the candles in the hall of the King-Mashiach, are in the hands of Rabbi %0a%3c Hamnuna-Saba. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the perfect righteous in need of these two final corrections merit %0a%3c receiving them only through revealing the soul of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba. And %0a%3c he stated that they (the disciples of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba) will merit the %0a%3c honor of serving in the hall of the King-Mashiach after their death, and will %0a%3c become his neighbors and the heads of the Creator's Assembly. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 120. Rabbi Chiya began and opened, "The beginning of Hochma (wisdom) is %0a%3c fear of the Creator, and those who observe this rule receive all the goodness." %0a%3c He asks, "The beginning of wisdom? One should rather say that the end of %0a%3c wisdom is the fear of the Creator, for fear of the Creator is the property %0a%3c of Malchut, which is at the end of Hochma (wisdom)." He replies, "Yet, %0a%3c M.alchut is the beginning of the entrance to the degrees of reception of the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom." Hence, it is written, "Open to me the gates of justice," %0a%3c meaning that the gates of M.alchut, called "justice," are the Creator's gates. %0a%3c And if man does not enter these gates he shall not reach the Supernal King %0a%3c through any other, for He is concealed and detached, and has erected many %0a%3c gates on the path to Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fear of the Creator is the Sefira Malchut. Yet, how can Malchut serve as an %0a%3c entrance if she is the last of the ten SefirotJ Indeed, she may be called the end of %0a%3c Hochma or of a Partzuf, but not the beginning. However, this is not an allegorical %0a%3c expression, but the essence itself, for HE IS CONCEALED AND DETACHED %0a%3c and no thought of man can attain Him. Hence, He has put up many gates %0a%3c ON THE PATH TO HIM, and thanks to these gates He grants sufferers the %0a%3c opportunity to draw closer to him, the opportunity for attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is precisely what the verse, "Open to me the gates of justice," (Tehilim, %0a%3c 118) alludes to; these are the very gates that the Creator made, through %0a%3c which people can come to Him. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF ALL THE %0a%3c GATES ERECTED A SPECIAL GATE WITH MANY LOCKS. This gate is %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut, the ultimate point of all creation, the ultimate point of %0a%3c all Supernal gates. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this last gate (from Above downwards) is the first gate to Supernal %0a%3c wisdom (from below upwards), for it is impossible to attain the Supernal Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c 271 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (wisdom) without attaining precisely this final gate, as it is the first gate with %0a%3c regard to attainment of the Supernal wisdom. It is therefore written (Tehilim, %0a%3c 111:10): "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom," as fear of the Creator %0a%3c is called the final gate, which stands first on the path to Supernal attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c 121. And at the end of all the gates He erected a special gate with several %0a%3c locks, several entrances, and several chambers, one atop of the other. And He %0a%3c said, "Whoever wishes to reach Me, let this be the first gate on his way to Me. %0a%3c Whoever enters through this gate— will enter." Only this is the first gate to the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, the gate of fear of the Creator, Malchut, which is hence %0a%3c called "beginning." %0a%3c %0a%3c The locks, entrances, and chambers are three successive processes of %0a%3c attainment, of realizing the spiritual in one's inner sensation. The thought that %0a%3c created the world was the Creator's thought to make a creation (the human %0a%3c soul) in order to fill it with delight. However, it is impossible to feel delight as %0a%3c long as one is removed from the Creator, for He is the only One in existence. %0a%3c And He has created us in such a way that the nearer we come to Him, the greater %0a%3c delight we feel, whereas the farther we are from Him, the more we suffer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those of us who live in and perceive only this world can only accept the above %0a%3c words on faith or reject them. However, Kabbalists, who ascend spiritually and %0a%3c draw closer to the Creator, make these assertions and describe their attainments %0a%3c for us. And as to how and when we shall travel the same path to the Creator and %0a%3c attain complete unity with Him, this depends on us alone. However, regardless %0a%3c of whether we want to or not, we will need to travel the entire path from our %0a%3c world to complete unity with the Creator while still existing in this body, during %0a%3c one of our lifetimes in this world. This is the purpose of creation, and until it is %0a%3c fulfilled, man must reincarnate and return to this world, as the sages said: "The %0a%3c Creator wished to dwell in the lower ones." %0a%3c %0a%3c Our world is built completely opposite from the Creator, as it was created %0a%3c in the property of egoistic will to receive pleasure, and this property is the exact %0a%3c antithesis to the Creator's property (desire) to delight us. Additionally, there is %0a%3c no trace of a will to receive pleasure in the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said about a person in our world: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" %0a%3c (lyov, 11:12). Therefore, to those who live in this world, the Creator's governance %0a%3c seems completely opposite to the purpose of creation— to delight the creatures. %0a%3c After all, that is how we perceive His rule over us, and feel the surrounding %0a%3c world in our egoistic sensations. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 273 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ding to the Creator's plan, one must correct his egoistic desires %0a%3c m altruistic, whereupon the Creator fulfills them with superr %0a%3c t (to the extent of their correction). Until one attains this stat %0a%3c esire to enjoy either this world or the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c These sensations are called "gate locks," for all the numerous contradictior %0a%3c to the oneness of the Creator's actions that we feel in this world separate us %0a%3c from the Creator and prevent us from drawing closer to Him. However, when %0a%3c we exert to observe the To rah and Mitzvot with love, with our heart and soul, %0a%3c as devotedly as it was prescribed for us, with the sole intention of pleasing the %0a%3c eator and without any benefit for ourselves, all of the forces that separate %0a%3c Him and every contradiction that we overcome on our path to Him %0a%3c a gate of attainment of His Supernal wisdom, of Ohr Hochma. This is %0a%3c because every contradiction reveals its own uniqueness in the attainment of the %0a%3c Creator's governance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, those very questions and contradictions, which initially seemed %0a%3c to prevent us from accepting the oneness of the Creator's governance, then %0a%3c turn into knowledge, thanks to which we come to understand and attain the %0a%3c oneness of His governance. %0a%3c %0a%3c And those who merit this transform darkness into Light (within themselves) %0a%3c and bitterness into sweetness. This is how they feel their attainments— in precisely %0a%3c those past sensations of darkness and bitterness. For the forces that repel us %0a%3c from the Creator, that form our minds and are perceived by the body as bitter %0a%3c turn into gates of attainment of Supernal Degrees. This way, darkness becomes %0a%3c Light and bitterness becomes sweetness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the more negative the Creator's governance is first perceived, %0a%3c deeper man eventually comes to realize the perfection of His governance. At %0a%3c last, the entire world ends up on the scale of merit, for every force and insight %0a%3c now serve as SHAAREY TZEDEJC (the gates of truth), through which one can %0a%3c enter and receive from the Creator everything that He intended to bestow at the %0a%3c Thought of Creation. Thus, it is written about such contradictions that turn %0a%3c into realization of unity: "These are the gates to the Creator; the righteous shall %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, until one merits turning his will "to receive for himself into the will %0a%3c "to receive for the Creator" with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot, all the gates %0a%3c to the Creator have sturdy locks (the sensation of imperfection in the Creator's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ome %0a%3c , the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 274 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c eator. And they are called locks, for they lock the gates of > %0a%3c •eator and distance us from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;fore we %0a%3c Creator's %0a%3c yeetness %0a%3c ; e goism %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c awever, if we make efforts to overcon %0a%3c ikening our love for the Creator, we %0a%3c entrances, darkness into Light, and bitterness into sweetness. This is because %0a%3c for every lock we receive a special degree of attainment of the Creator. These %0a%3c degrees become entrances that lead to the degrees of sensation of the Creator %0a%3c Himself. And the degrees themselves turn into halls or chambers of wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we see that locks, entrances, and chambers constitute the three types %0a%3c of perception of one material, our will to receive or egoism. Indeed, before we %0a%3c xe egoistic desire to receive into reception (of pleasure) for the Create %0a%3c ltruism, this material transforms Light into darkness and swe %0a%3c less, in accordance with our (egoistic) taste. In other words, %0a%3c finds suffering in the same types of influence that bring pleasure to altruism. %0a%3c Therefore, to perceive the Light (delight) that surrounds us, we only need %0a%3c to change our senses. But until we do, this Light will be perceived by us as %0a%3c darkness and suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially, whatever examples of the Creator's governance we see, they distance %0a%3c us from Him. This is because we perceive them negatively; at that very moment, %0a%3c our egoism (will to receive pleasure) begets locks. However, once we transform %0a%3c our desires to "reception for the Creator's sake," these locks become entrances, %0a%3c and entrances turn into chambers— vessels of wisdom, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the end of all the degrees, i.e., the very last degree, %0a%3c below which nothing can possibly exist, is called Malchut de Malchut. To attain %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, one must first overcome this last gate, which turns into %0a%3c the first gate to ascend from below upwards, toward the chamber of Supernal %0a%3c wisdom, the Sefira Hochma. All gates become entrances and chambers of the %0a%3c Creator's wisdom. This is why it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (the first %0a%3c words in the Torah), for IN THE BEGINNING signifies fear of the Creator, %0a%3c the last gate (Malchut), which becomes the first on the path to attainment of the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c 122. The letter Bet in the word BERESHEET (IN THE BEGINNING) %0a%3c indicates that the two are joined together in Malchut. Both are points: one %0a%3c is concealed, while the other is revealed. However, since there's no division %0a%3c between them, they are called THE BEGINNING, which signifies only one, %0a%3c rather than two, for he who takes one, takes the other as well, and all is one, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 275 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for He and His Name are one, as it is written, "And you shall know that this %0a%3c is the Creator's only name." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew letter Bet has a numerical value of two, indicating two points. %0a%3c These two points symbolize the correction of the egoistic point of Malchut, %0a%3c onto which the point of mercy (Bina) imposes a restriction of use. Correction %0a%3c is achieved when Malchut (strictness) ascends to Bina (mercy), as it is written, %0a%3c "So they both walked" (Rut, 1:19), i.e., Bina and Malchut. Hence, the screen in %0a%3c Malchut consists of both points, and they are thereby joined together as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is explained in Megilat Rut (The Book of Ruth) how Malchut (Ruth) merges %0a%3c with Bina (Naomi), which then leads to the correction of Malchut and the %0a%3c birth of David, the first King (the word King (Melech) is derived from Malchut %0a%3c (kingdom) of Israel). %0a%3c %0a%3c HOWEVER, ONE IS CONCEALED, WHILE THE OTHER IS %0a%3c REVEALED, for the judgment in the point of Malchut is concealed, whereas %0a%3c only the property of mercy in the point of Bina is revealed. Otherwise, the world %0a%3c could not exist, as it is written, "In the beginning, He created the world with %0a%3c the property of judgment, but seeing that it cannot exist, He attached to it the %0a%3c property of mercy" (Beresheet Raba, item 1). %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the restriction is concealed, this does not mean that a Zivug is not %0a%3c made on it, since these two points merge into one, and the point of Malchut %0a%3c receives a Zivug together with the point of Bina, though it participates in it %0a%3c secretly. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING, for the word "beginning" %0a%3c indicates one point, which includes two that are as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because Malchut participates with Bina in all the Zivugim that are made %0a%3c during the 6,000 years (albeit secretly), she corrects herself to such an extent that %0a%3c at the end of all the corrections, even her property of restriction is corrected, %0a%3c and she acquires the property of Bina. It is written of this state that on that day %0a%3c He and His Name will be one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the properly of restriction is also concealed within the letter Bet of %0a%3c the word BERESHEET (in the beginning), this property is called RESHEET %0a%3c (first) in Hochma (wisdom). However, the correction of this property occurs %0a%3c only at the end of corrections, when the Supernal wisdom is revealed, as the %0a%3c prophet said: "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Creator" %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 11:9). This is because the last gate will become the first. Hence, it is %0a%3c written, "That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the Lord, the %0a%3c Most High over all the earth," (Tehilim, 83:19) for the Creator's wisdom will be %0a%3c revealed in our world to all. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 276 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 123. Why is Malchut called "fear of the Creator?" It is because Malchut is the %0a%3c Tree of Good and Evil: If man merits, it is good, but if he does not, it is evil. %0a%3c This is why fear dwells in that place. And this gate leads to all the goodness %0a%3c that exists in the world. ALL THE GOODNESS signifies two gates, two points %0a%3c that are as one. Rabbi Yosi said that ALL THE GOODNESS refers to the Tree %0a%3c of Life, for it is entirely good and completely without evil. And because it is %0a%3c without evil, it is entirely good, without evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of the last gate: THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS FEAR %0a%3c OF THE CREATOR. So why is it called "fear of the Creator?" Because this %0a%3c is the secret of the Tree of Knowledge, by which Adam sinned, for the use of %0a%3c that point (egoistic desires) is punishable by death (disappearance of the Light). %0a%3c And great fear is needed to refrain from touching (using) it before all the other %0a%3c desires have been corrected. Nevertheless, at the end of correction, when even %0a%3c this point is completely corrected, death will cease to exist for all eternity. That %0a%3c is why it is called "fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator created one creation— the egoistic Malchut. The goal of creation %0a%3c is to fill her with the Creator's Light using an altruistic intention. As a result, %0a%3c Malchut merges with the Creator and receives limitless delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, the only creation, consists of five parts: KHB ZAM. Her parts %0a%3c KHB ZA, excluding Malchut de Malchut, have altruistic properties, which they %0a%3c received from the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of her decision to refrain from receiving Light into egoistic %0a%3c desires, called T^imt^um Aleph (the first restriction), Malchut receives the Light %0a%3c only in her first four desires: KHB-ZA. Malchut de Malchut remains inaccessible %0a%3c to the Light. So how can she be corrected? %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct Malchut de Malchut's properties (desires), the Creator creates %0a%3c the conditions under which Bina and Malchut mix, and consequently, Malchut %0a%3c acquires the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process needs to occur more than once, so that all of Malchut 's parts %0a%3c will be mixed with Bina. Every time it takes place in an increasingly deeper layer %0a%3c of Malchut, it is called the breaking of holiness, for Bina descends and passes %0a%3c her properties to Malchut, but she herself breaks during this mixing, as though %0a%3c losing her altruistic properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we can conclude that all the shattering of vessels, the breaking of %0a%3c Adam's soul, the ruin of the First and Second Temples, and other spiritual %0a%3c disasters take place not as punishment, for punishment (as we understand it) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 277 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c does not exist in the spiritual, but only so as to enable the altruistic desires of %0a%3c Bina penetrate deeper into the egoistic desires of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The last point of Malchut, the yet uncorrected Malchut de Malchut, is that %0a%3c very point the use of which is punishable by death (the Light's disappearance is %0a%3c considered death). It is forbidden to use Malchut de Malchut until all the other %0a%3c properties of Malchut (KHB-ZA) have been fully corrected. Or rather, if man %0a%3c refrains from using egoism (the point of Malchut de Malchut), and uses only %0a%3c his other altruistic desires, he gradually constructs a "non-reception" screen on %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having filled all of his corrected desires with Light, man achieves the end %0a%3c of correction— of what he could correct by himself. As soon as that happens, %0a%3c i.e., as soon as one receives the Light in all of his soul's first nine Sefirot (KHB- %0a%3c ZA, excluding Malchut), the Light called Mashiach descends from Above, which %0a%3c imparts Malchut de Malchut with the altruistic property of bestowal, of acting for %0a%3c the Creator's sake. This concludes the entire correction process of man's soul, %0a%3c and he attains complete unity with the Creator. The Creator's goal is for man %0a%3c to attain this state while still living in our world and in his physical body, to %0a%3c combine all the worlds, spiritual and material, within himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THIS GATE LEADS TO ALL THE GOODNESS, for there is nothing %0a%3c better than the revelation of the Supernal wisdom in the world, included in %0a%3c the Thought of Creation. And since fear of the Creator is the last gate to the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, it also constitutes the gate to all the goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c THESE TWO GATES ARE AS ONE refers to the two points, Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, which are united in the letter Bet of the word BERESHEET (IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING), the first word in the Torah. And the two points are mentioned %0a%3c because they allude to the state following the correction, when these two points %0a%3c are called "the two gates," for both turn out to be good and free from evil, %0a%3c thereby bringing man only perfect goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, until the end of correction, one must strain to separate within %0a%3c him the desires that refer to the point of Bina from those that refer to the point %0a%3c of Malchut, to reject the desires of Malchut, and, in defiance of egoism, use %0a%3c the desires of Bina. During man's work on self-correction, called "6,000 years," %0a%3c these two points are referred to as "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%3c %0a%3c RABBI YOSI SAID-Rabbi Yosi does not object to the words of Rabbi Chiya. %0a%3c They are talking about two different states: Rabbi Chiya alludes to a state past %0a%3c the end of correction of Malchut, when both points become a gate, and there %0a%3c is no more evil within them. And Rabbi Yosi explains a state in the correction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 278 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c process, when the two points, Bina and Malchut, exist within us as our Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge of Good and Evil. Hence, he tells us that ALL THE GOODNESS %0a%3c IS (can only be found in) THE TREE OF LIFE. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA filled with the Light of Ima-Bina is called "The Tree of Life," for he %0a%3c possesses only good properties. And the two points of good and evil, Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, remain within Malchut until the end of correction; hence, Malchut is %0a%3c called "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%3c %0a%3c 124. To all those who act, it is the faithful mercy of David that upholds the %0a%3c Torah. Those who keep the Torah seemingly create it themselves. All those who %0a%3c study the Torah— there is no action in them as they study, but those who keep %0a%3c the Torah— in them there is action. And the world exists by this force, eternal %0a%3c are the wisdom and the Torah, and the throne stands just as it should stand. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was previously said that fear of the Creator constitutes the last gate, though %0a%3c it is the first gate to the Supernal wisdom. It turns out that ALL THOSE WHO %0a%3c STUDY THE TORAH have already corrected the last gate, and the two points %0a%3c become for them two entrances, all goodness without evil. Hence, it is said that %0a%3c THERE IS NO ACTION IN THEM, i.e., no analysis of good and evil, for they %0a%3c have already corrected everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, those who have not yet reached the end of correction are referred %0a%3c to as those who keep the Torah. There is action in them, for they have not yet %0a%3c corrected good and evil in everyone's Tree of Good and Evil— not everyone has %0a%3c realized in one's inner tree (in all of one's properties) what is good and what is %0a%3c evil with regard to the spiritual truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH SEEMINGLY %0a%3c CREATE IT THEMSELVES. As a result of man's effort to refrain from their %0a%3c use, all the distracting and impeding forces (thoughts and desires) of the point %0a%3c of Malchut become gates, all the locks become entrances, and all the entrances %0a%3c become chambers of wisdom filled with Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that all the wisdom and the entire Torah become revealed only %0a%3c through the efforts of those who keep the Torah. Hence, they SEEMINGLY %0a%3c CREATE IT THEMSELVES. The forces of good and evil are combined within %0a%3c them, and they become those who keep the Torah, for the Torah is revealed %0a%3c thanks to their inner work of separating and correcting good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such people are called "those who act," for they seemingly create the Torah %0a%3c by themselves. After all, without perceiving the Creator (The Torah, Light) as %0a%3c concealed, and then overcoming this concealment, thereby turning it into gates, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 279 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The perfection of the Creator's actions lies in the fact that by creating man %0a%3c so paltry (with such insignificant egoistic desires, completely opposite to the %0a%3c Creator in his properties, and utterly powerless to change himself), the Creator %0a%3c gave man an opportunity to become like Him (in properties, greatness, and the %0a%3c sensation of creating himself), to create within and by himself all of the worlds %0a%3c and the Torah. By revealing the Light, it is as though man actually creates it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, since these individuals reveal the Torah, they are regarded as its %0a%3c creators. The word is SEEMINGLY used to indicate that the Torah was created %0a%3c before the creation of our world (Talmud, Pesachim, 54:1), and of course, it is the %0a%3c work of the Creator Himself. Yet, without the good deeds of those who keep the %0a%3c Torah, it would not have been revealed to the world. Hence, they are regarded %0a%3c as the makers and creators of the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wisdom and the Torah are eternal; that is, they exist even after the %0a%3c end of correction, for fear of the Creator is needed even then. However, once %0a%3c the entire egoism is corrected, there is no place from which to take this fear, %0a%3c for the Tree of Good and Evil becomes only good, and can no longer furnish %0a%3c fear of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, because they received fear in the past, they can continue using it %0a%3c in the present, after the end of correction, when there is nothing left to fear, as %0a%3c there are no restrictions in Malchut. And the only reason they can do so is that %0a%3c during the correction they worked on creating within them the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator's absolute rule and the eternity of the Torah. And since this fear is never- %0a%3c ending, the Creator's throne remains forever standing in their attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 125. Rabbi Shimon was sitting and studying the Torah on the night when the %0a%3c Bride, Malchut, unites with her husband, Zeir Anpin. And all the friends %0a%3c present in the bridal chamber on that night, the eve of the holiday of Shavuot %0a%3c (Pentecost), must stand together with the bridegroom under the Huppah %0a%3c (wedding canopy), and be with him this whole night, and rejoice with him %0a%3c in the corrections of the Bride, i.e., study the Torah, then Prophets, then %0a%3c Holy Scriptures, and finally the wisdom, for these corrections are the Bride's %0a%3c adornments. And the Bride receives corrections, adorns herself with them, %0a%3c and rejoices with them all of that night. And on the next day, on the holiday of %0a%3c Shavuot, she only comes to the Huppah together with them. And her friends, %0a%3c who studied the Torah all night long, are called the sons of the Huppah. And as %0a%3c she approaches the Huppah, the Creator asks about them, blesses and adorns %0a%3c them with the Bride's adornments. Happy are those who merit this! %0a%3c %0a%3c All the days of exile are called night, for this is when the Creator's face is %0a%3c concealed from Israel, as the impure forces rule and separate His loyal servants %0a%3c from Him. Yet, this is the time when the bride unites with her husband (in %0a%3c Hebrew, "husband" and "master" are the same word, so one must keep in mind %0a%3c the second meaning of the word as well). The Huppah is a wedding canopy, under %0a%3c which the ritual of union between a bride and a bridegroom (their merging in %0a%3c a Zivug) takes place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The union between the bride and her husband (The Zohar uses the word %0a%3c "husband" instead of "bridegroom") occurs thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot %0a%3c (commandments) of the righteous, referred to as "those who keep the Torah." %0a%3c And all the Supernal Degrees, called "secrets of the Torah," become revealed %0a%3c thanks to them alone, for they are also called MAKERS (as though CREATING %0a%3c the Torah itself), as is described in item 124. Therefore, the time of exile is called %0a%3c the NIGHT WHEN THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER HUSBAND. AND %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 281 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 282 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL THE FRIENDS, THE SONS OF THE BRIDE'S JOY, ARE CALLED %0a%3c THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH. %0a%3c %0a%3c And after THE END OF CORRECTION and complete deliverance, of %0a%3c which the prophet Zachariah writes (14:7): "And there shall be one day, which %0a%3c shall be known to the Creator, neither day nor night, but it shall come to pass %0a%3c come evening time: there shall be light." THE NEXT DAY, THE BRIDE AND %0a%3c HER HUSBAND ENTER THE HUPPAH, for BON will become like SAG and %0a%3c MA will be like AB (see item 64). %0a%3c %0a%3c This state is therefore defined as the next day and a new Huppah. Whereas %0a%3c at this time (in this state), the righteous are called SONS OF THE HUPPAH, %0a%3c in whom there is no action, for then, as it is written: "They shall not do evil %0a%3c upon My holy mountain, for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the %0a%3c Creator, as waters cover the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since these righteous elevated BON to SAG by their actions, i.e., made %0a%3c its properties similar to those of SAG, they are considered to have made a new %0a%3c Huppah, they are called "sons of the Huppah." %0a%3c %0a%3c The night of Shavuot (Pentecost) is when THE BRIDE UNITES WITH HER %0a%3c HUSBAND, for the Huppah takes place on the next day, the day of Shavuot, the %0a%3c day of the reception of the Torah. On that day, all of creation achieves the state %0a%3c of the end of correction, as it is said: "He will swallow up death forever; and the %0a%3c Creator Himself will wipe away the tears off all faces" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah describes this state as "engraved upon the scrolls" (Shemot, 32: 16). %0a%3c In Hebrew, the word "engraved" is Harut, but it should be pronounced Herut %0a%3c (freedom), freedom from the angel of death. However, the sin of the golden calf %0a%3c followed and the High Degree was lost. Since Shavuot is the day when the Torah %0a%3c was received, it is also regarded as the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the necessary preparations (the corrections carried out %0a%3c during the concealment period) are completed beforehand, on the night %0a%3c before the holiday of Shavuot. This night is hence defined as the night when %0a%3c the bride unites with her husband so as to enter the Huppah the following %0a%3c day, on the holiday of Shavuot, when all the corrections are completed and %0a%3c liberated from the angel of death, thanks to the actions of the righteous, who %0a%3c erect a new Hu£>£>ah. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the bride's friends, those who keep the Torah, also called "sons of %0a%3c the bridal chamber," must be merged with the Shechina-Malchut (the bride) all %0a%3c of that night, called "exile." Only then do their acts in the Torah and Mitzvot %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 283 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c correct and purify the good in her from the taint of evil, so she would emerge %0a%3c with the properties that contain only good, without evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, those who keep the Torah should rejoice together with the bride %0a%3c for all the great corrections that they've made in her. Then they joyously %0a%3c continue with their corrections in THE TORAH, then in PROPHETS and %0a%3c finally in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. All the degrees and revelations of the %0a%3c secrets of the Torah, which make up the framework of the Shechina herself at %0a%3c the end of her correction, are made exclusively by the righteous, who keep the %0a%3c Torah during the exile. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the degrees that emerge at the time (state) of the exile are %0a%3c called the bride's corrections and adornments from the Torah, Prophets and %0a%3c Holy Scriptures, for Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet constitute the Torah, Sefirot %0a%3c Net^ah, Hod, and Yesod are the Prophets, and Malchut is the Holy Scriptures. The %0a%3c Light of VAK is called Midrashim and the Light of GAR is called "the secrets of %0a%3c the Torah." And all these corrections must be made in Malchut (the bride) on %0a%3c the night when she completes her corrections (precisely in the darkness of exile %0a%3c from the spiritual does man carry out the work of his inner correction). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is known that the end of correction does not bring anything new or that %0a%3c was previously unknown. Rather, all the MAN and MAD, along with all degrees %0a%3c and Zivugim that have emerged consecutively during the 6,000 years will merge %0a%3c into one degree and become corrected with the help of the Light of Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bride will then enter her Huppah, and THE CREATOR WILL ASK %0a%3c ABOUT EVERYONE, about every man who had even once raised MAN for the %0a%3c Supernal, final Zivug. For the Creator waits for all the small Zivugim to assemble, %0a%3c as though asking about and waiting for each of them. And when they've %0a%3c gathered, a great Zivug will unfold, called RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL (HE %0a%3c WHO BLESSES AND ADORNS HER). And when all the creatures are blessed %0a%3c and adorned together, correction comes to an end. This is referred to as "the %0a%3c adornment of the bride's crown." %0a%3c %0a%3c 126. This is why Rabbi Shimon and all of his friends stayed up that night, %0a%3c and each of them renewed the Torah again and again. Rabbi Shimon was %0a%3c joyous, and so were his friends. Rabbi Shimon said to them: "My sons, how %0a%3c blessed is your lot, for it is you who shall accompany the Bride tomorrow %0a%3c to the Huppah, for all those who correct Her and rejoice in Her this night %0a%3c shall have their names recorded in the Book of Remembrance. And the %0a%3c Creator shall bless them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns %0a%3c of the Upper World." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 284 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Remembrance, mentioned by the prophet (Malachi, 3:15): "You %0a%3c will say, 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's %0a%3c will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all? And now %0a%3c we regard the wicked as blessed: they have settled in their wickedness, tried the %0a%3c Creator, and were liberated.' Then those who feared the Creator spoke with %0a%3c each other, and the Creator hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance %0a%3c was recorded before Him for those who fear the Creator and honor His Name. %0a%3c 'They shall become chosen for Me on the day that I shall determine, and I shall %0a%3c spare them, as a man spares his own son, who serves him.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c But how can we understand that when they spoke ill of the Creator, %0a%3c they referred to fear of the Creator, as the prophet says? Moreover, they were %0a%3c inscribed in the Book of Remembrance as those who "feared the Creator and %0a%3c honored His Name?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that at the end of correction, when the great general Zivug %0a%3c of AtiJc manifests, great Light will be revealed in all the worlds, and in this %0a%3c Light everyone will return to the Creator in absolute love. The Talmud (Yoma, %0a%3c 86:2, "Introduction to the Study of the Ten Sefirot") says: "He who attains the %0a%3c repentance from love shall have his sins turned to merits." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, the prophet refers to the sinners claiming the futility of spiritual %0a%3c work: on the great day of the end of correction, when the Light of repentance %0a%3c from love shall shine, all the most malicious and deliberate, worst imaginable %0a%3c sins, will turn to merits, and their words shall be deemed not slight, but fear %0a%3c of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all the sins, as well as all the good deeds, are recorded before the %0a%3c Creator, for He will need them on that great day of His miracle: all the merits %0a%3c gather and complete the Kli, which receives the Light necessary for the final %0a%3c correction. Hence, it is said that the Creator shall record the names of those %0a%3c who fear Him in the Book of Remembrance, for He will need them on that day %0a%3c to complete the common Partzuf. This is exactly what the prophet says: those %0a%3c who remain shall be close to the Creator, like sons who served Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that everyone and everything will be recorded in the %0a%3c Book of Remembrance, even the sins. However, The Creator will record them %0a%3c as though they are merits, as though they served Him. These are the words of %0a%3c the prophet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The number seventy signifies the Light of Hochma, GAR, adornment, a %0a%3c crown, and the Light of Hassadim is called "a blessing," for the world was created %0a%3c with the letter Bet (blessing), as it is written: "The world was built by mercy" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 285 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (Tehilim, 89:3), which is VAK. But at the end of correction, the Light of Hassadim %0a%3c will also be like seventy crowns, like the Light of Hochma, for MA and BON will %0a%3c ascend to AB and SAG. Therefore, The Zohar says that the Creator will bless %0a%3c them with seventy blessings and adornments of crowns of the Upper World. %0a%3c %0a%3c 127. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "The Heavens declare the Creator's %0a%3c greatness. I have already explained this, but when the bride awakens to enter %0a%3c the Huppah on the following day, with all the friends who rejoiced with her %0a%3c through that night, she rejoices with them, corrects herself and shines with %0a%3c her adornments." %0a%3c %0a%3c 128. And on the following day, a multitude of masses, hosts, and legions %0a%3c join her. And she, together with all these masses, hosts and legions, awaits %0a%3c all those who corrected her by studying the Torah on that night. This is so %0a%3c because Zeir Anpin unites with Malchut, and she sees her husband, and %0a%3c it is said: "The Heavens declare the Creator's greatness." "The Heavens" %0a%3c alludes to the Bridegroom (ZA), who enters the Huppah. "The Heavens %0a%3c declare," i.e., shine, like the luminescence of a sapphire, upon the entire %0a%3c Malchut, from end to end. %0a%3c %0a%3c The day of the end of correction is called "tomorrow," as it is written in %0a%3c the Talmud: "Do today, and receive the reward tomorrow" (Eruvin, 22:1). The %0a%3c masses are the worldly masses who do not serve the Creator, the hosts are those %0a%3c who serve the Creator, and the legions are chariots of warriors in armor— the %0a%3c Supernal groups of angels that accompany the souls, as it is said: "For He bid %0a%3c His angels to guard over you on all your paths" (Tehilim, 91:11). Just as the %0a%3c Creator waits for everyone, as was previously stated, so does the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Heavens" is the bridegroom entering the Huppah— the state of the end of %0a%3c correction, of which it is written: "And the light of the moon (Malchut) shall %0a%3c be as the light of the sun (ZA)" (Yeshayahu, 30:26). The Creator is called the %0a%3c "Heavens," and at the end of correction He is referred to as the "bridegroom," %0a%3c as it is said: "Just as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so shall your Creator %0a%3c rejoice over you." (Yeshayahu, 62:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c Wherever it is said that the Creator descends, it indicates His strictness %0a%3c and judgment, for it speaks of diminishing His greatness in the eyes of the %0a%3c lower ones, as it is said: "His might and greatness are in His place." But at the %0a%3c end of correction, when all sins turn to merits, for it will become clear that all %0a%3c the spiritual descents were nothing other than spiritual ascents, the Creator %0a%3c becomes the "bridegroom" and the Shechina becomes his "bride." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 286 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew word for "bride" is Kalah, as in the words KalatMoshe (Bamidbar, %0a%3c 7), which describes the completion of the altar. Hence, in the Torah, the word %0a%3c Kalah signifies the end of construction. The Hebrew word for "bridegroom" %0a%3c is Hatan, and it signifies the descent along spiritual degrees, as it is said in the %0a%3c Talmud: "Descends the steps" (Yevamot, 63:1). However, this descent is greater %0a%3c than all the previous ascents, for it takes place on the way towards the bride at %0a%3c the moment of the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Huppah represents the total of all the Returning Light received on the %0a%3c MAN raised by the righteous in all the Zivugim at all the times during the 6,000 %0a%3c years. This is because now they have all gathered into one great Returning Light, %0a%3c rising and soaring over the Creator and the Shechina, over the bridegroom and %0a%3c his bride, like a Huppah— wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this state, the righteous are called "Sons of the Huppah," for each of %0a%3c them has a part in this Huppah, to the extent of the MAN they raise to the %0a%3c screen of Malchut, which evoked, produced the Returning Light, corresponding %0a%3c in magnitude to this MAN. At the end of correction, the Creator is called Hatan %0a%3c (bridegroom), for He Nechit Darga— descends from His degree to his bride, and %0a%3c enters the Huppah. %0a%3c %0a%3c At this time (in this state), the Heavens say— this is a great Zivug of the future, %0a%3c as the Talmud says: "The wife speaks to her husband" (Berachot, 3:1). The word %0a%3c "speaks" (Mesaperet) implies a Zivug, and is derived from Sapir (sapphire), the %0a%3c name of the Shechina, as it is said in the Torah, "...and under His feet— like a %0a%3c pavement of sapphire" (Shemot, 24:10). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LUMINESCENT SAPPHIRE is the Returning Light, ascending from %0a%3c below upwards. LUMINESCENT, LIKE LUMINESCENCE— The Returning %0a%3c Light, LUMINESCENT is equivalent to the Direct Light, LUMINESCENCE. %0a%3c This great Zivug gathers all of the Returning Light from all the Zivugim made %0a%3c during the 6,000 years, and the Direct Light will shine in it, as it is said, FROM %0a%3c END TO END. %0a%3c %0a%3c 129. The Creator's glory = EL— is the bride, Malchut, called EL, as it is %0a%3c written: "EL rages each day." She is called EL on all the days of the year. And %0a%3c now, on the holiday of Shavuot, when she already entered the Huppah, she %0a%3c is called GREATNESS and she is called EL, greatest of the great, luminescent %0a%3c out of the luminescent, dominion over dominions. %0a%3c %0a%3c El is the name of great mercy. Yet, here it says: "El rages each day," which is %0a%3c contrary to mercy. The Torah says: "And there shall be evening, and there shall %0a%3c be morning, one day." The Shechina is a small star, the Moon, which reigns at %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 287 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c night. It is called "fear of Heaven," for it is the property of the righteous, who %0a%3c must raise MAN through their aspiration to be corrected, thereby evoking the %0a%3c Returning Light to descend on Malchut from Above and correct her. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: "The Creator hath made it so man would fear Him" %0a%3c (Kohelet, 3:14). This is so because it is impossible to raise the MAN without fear. %0a%3c The absence of fear of the Creator is referred to as Malchut's reign at night, in %0a%3c the state of darkness. In the absence of Light, all the restrictions and suffering %0a%3c are revealed, as they are opposite to the property of day, mercy. Thus, fear of the %0a%3c Creator emerges; were it not for this fear, the property of morning and day could %0a%3c not be revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c So it is written: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, %0a%3c one day." Night also enters morning, for without a night, there would be no %0a%3c morning, and one cannot do without night. It is hence written that EL RAGES %0a%3c EACH DAY. After all, the property of mercy, called EL, is revealed only with the %0a%3c help of the night, through the property of RAGE. Hence, this property is also %0a%3c regarded as mercy; and consequently, the Shechina is called EL. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S GREATNESS = EL-IS THE %0a%3c BRIDE, MALCHUT, CALLED EL, for it is impossible to achieve the state of %0a%3c "day" without the state of "night." So it is in each of the six days of creation, of %0a%3c which it is said: "And there shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one %0a%3c day." We see that the night is included in the name "day." And just as they are %0a%3c all called the six DAYS of creation, the 6,000 years are called "night" in the %0a%3c property of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c And in the great Zivug at the end of correction, a day shall come; the light of %0a%3c the moon will become like that of the sun, as the prophet said (Zachariah, 14:7): %0a%3c "It shall come to pass, that at evening time there shall be light." This will cause %0a%3c the degrees of Malchut to increase twofold, for even during the 6,000 years, the %0a%3c light of the moon was according to the aforesaid, "And there shall be evening, %0a%3c and there shall be morning." %0a%3c %0a%3c And at the end of correction, when the moon becomes like the sun (ZA), %0a%3c the moon will be twice as great as before, as it will become greatness itself, for %0a%3c its greatness will equal that of ZA, of which The Zohar says: THE GREATEST %0a%3c OF THE GREAT, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS. Although it merged %0a%3c with the light of the morning during the 6,000 years, as it is said, "And there %0a%3c shall be evening, and there shall be morning, one day," now that it is as big %0a%3c as the sun (ZA), it becomes Light, itself, LUMINESCENT OUT OF THE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 288 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LUMINESCENT. Previously, its Light was solely the result of the inclusion of %0a%3c the properties of Higher Sefirot into it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, DOMINION OVER DOMINIONS, for during the 6,000 years, its %0a%3c reign was that of a small star, reigning only at night. Now, however, it also reigns %0a%3c during the day, for it is as big as the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c 130. The hour when the Heaven (ZA) enters the Huppah and shines upon %0a%3c MalcHwt, all of her friends, who corrected her by studying the Torah, are %0a%3c known by their names, as it is said: "The Heavens declare the work of His %0a%3c hands." "The work of His hands" refers to the members of this covenant, %0a%3c called "the work of His hands." As you say: "Confirm for us the work of our %0a%3c hands," which is the mark of the covenant, imprinted on man's body. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Friends" are those who keep the Torah, which includes both good and %0a%3c evil deeds, even those parts of them that are still evil and uncorrected; EACH %0a%3c IS KNOWN BY A NAME (his corrected part), as it is said: THE HEAVENS %0a%3c DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. "Heavens" is the Book of Remem- %0a%3c brance, which constitutes the Light of the great Zivug that leads to repentance %0a%3c (correction) out of love, when sins become merits (Talmud, Yoma, 86:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c And even those who were speaking ill things, it is said about them: "Then %0a%3c they shall impart their fear of the Creator upon one another" (item 126). %0a%3c Therefore, the action defined as "upholding the Torah," which includes both %0a%3c good (for the worthy) and evil (for the unworthy), now becomes completely %0a%3c good and holy. And it turns into THE WORK OF HIS HANDS-the Creator's %0a%3c actions, for THE HEAVENS SPEAK even of the unworthy. It turns out that all %0a%3c the friends have performed only good deeds and carried out holy work, for they %0a%3c would all correct Malchut, and ALL ARE KNOWN BY THEIR NAMES. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said: CONFIRM FOR US THE WORK OF OUR HANDS %0a%3c (Tehilim, 90:17). However, it is unclear whose hands are meant: His or ours? Only %0a%3c one thing is meant here— that the covenant is referred to as "the work of our hands," %0a%3c for its confirmation is Yesod (Yesod is not only the name of a Sefira, it also means %0a%3c "basis," "foundation" in Hebrew), the foundation of the entire construction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The correction of Yesod is Brit Milah (circumcision). Hence, it is said that %0a%3c the existence of the covenant is called "the work of our hands," for we separate %0a%3c the Orlah (foreskin) from Yesod through the work of our hands. But this only %0a%3c concerns the period up to the end of correction. And at the end of correction, %0a%3c THE WORK OF HIS HANDS will be revealed. In other words, the Creator %0a%3c Himself will detach the Orlah from us, and THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE %0a%3c WORK OF HIS HANDS. But until that state comes, we are entrusted with the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 289 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c correction of the circumcision. Therefore, we ask: CONFIRM FOR US THE %0a%3c WORK OF OUR HANDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c 131. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba then said as follows: "Do not let your mouth cause %0a%3c your body to sin," i.e., one must not allow his mouth to get close to evil and be %0a%3c the cause of sin for the sacred flesh, which bears the mark of the holy covenant %0a%3c with the Creator. If he does so, he shall be dragged to hell. And the ruler of %0a%3c hell, called Domeh, stands at the gates of hell with hundreds of thousands of %0a%3c angels, but he is forbidden to approach those who have kept the holy covenant %0a%3c in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a warning here: let each man be careful of what he utters, so that %0a%3c his prayer is pure when he raises MAN with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c If the impure force clings to his prayer, it will receive his MAN. As a result, %0a%3c man will develop a grudge against the Creator and foreign thoughts, thereby %0a%3c causing the Orlah to once again cling to the holy covenant. Consequently, %0a%3c his holy soul will fall into the captivity of the impure forces, and they will %0a%3c drag it to hell. This is similar to what Rabbi Elazar said about falling into %0a%3c Lilit's hands (item 68). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE SACRED FLESH, WHICH BEARS THE MARK OF THE HOLY %0a%3c COVENANT alludes to the holy soul guarded by the holy covenant, as it is said: %0a%3c "From my flesh I shall see the Creator," i.e., from my nature, my properties. Yet, %0a%3c doubts evoke the return of the impure force of the Orlah. It touches the holy %0a%3c covenant, and the Divine soul is instantly driven away. Hence, "The Tree cried %0a%3c out: Sinner, do not touch me," for this Tree is Yesod, Ateret Yesod (foreskin— the %0a%3c very essence of creation, egoism), the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c DOMEH, THE RULER OF HELL— DOMEH is derived from Dmamah- %0a%3c lifelessness, for he robs man of his soul and leaves him lifeless. This is the angel %0a%3c that fills man's heart with doubts regarding the Creator's greatness, and creates %0a%3c within him a sinful desire to perceive His plans as though they were plans of one %0a%3c born of a woman, i.e., as though they were of this world. And since he likens the %0a%3c Creator's thoughts in man's perception to those of man, he is named so (Domeh %0a%3c also means likeness, similarity). %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, man understands that the Creator's thoughts and ways are different %0a%3c from ours, for the created mind can grasp neither Him nor His thoughts nor %0a%3c His governance, as our mind is inferior to His. But, through sin, the angel %0a%3c Domeh plants a silly spirit within man, which forces him to say that the mind %0a%3c of one born of a woman is similar to the Creator's. This leaves man open to %0a%3c doubts, which DRAG HIM TO HELL. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 290 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the power of the angel Domeh is in his name, as it is said: "Who %0a%3c is as mighty as You, who is LIKE You, the King that kills and resurrects?" This %0a%3c indicates that the connection with the one who is LIKE him leads to death, %0a%3c whereas in the realization that there is none like Him, man finds life. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the doubts and thoughts that man receives from the angel Domeh %0a%3c are countless, as The Zohar says, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ANGELS %0a%3c ARE WITH HIM, and they are all standing at the gates of hell, through which %0a%3c man is dragged there, though the gates themselves are not yet considered hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c BUT HE (THE ANGEL) IS FORBIDDEN TO APPROACH THOSE %0a%3c WHO HAVE KEPT THE HOLY COVENANT IN THIS WORLD. And even if %0a%3c one did not fully keep (observe) the covenant, and there is still good and evil in %0a%3c his deeds, he is nonetheless regarded as one who has kept the holy covenant. So, %0a%3c unless one comes to doubt, the angel Domeh is forbidden to drag him to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c 132. When this happened to King David, fear enveloped him. Right then, %0a%3c Domeh ascended before the Creator, and said: "Master of the world, it says in %0a%3c the To rah (Vayikra, 20:10): 'And the man that commits adultery with another %0a%3c man's wife...' David broke his covenant, is it not so?" The Creator replied to %0a%3c him: "David is righteous, and his holy covenant remains pure, for it is known %0a%3c to Me that Bat Sheva was destined for him since the creation of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although David committed no sin, as the Talmud explains (Shabbat, 56: 1) that %0a%3c he who says that David sinned is wrong, he was enveloped with fear nonetheless, %0a%3c as if he really had sinned, for Domeh cited the Torah in his complaint. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Bat Sheva had been destined for David since the creation of the %0a%3c world (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 107:1); thus, he did not violate his covenant. Yet, if Bat %0a%3c Sheva had been destined for David, why was she first married to Uriah? After all, %0a%3c a wife is half of her husband's body. And if she is half of David's body, how could %0a%3c Uriah have taken her, if there is nothing in him that corresponds with her? %0a%3c %0a%3c The fact is that Bat Sheva is David's true Nukva (female) from the day of the %0a%3c creation of the world, for David is the male part of Malchut, while Bat Sheva %0a%3c is the Nukva in Malchut. But since, as the world was being created, Malchut %0a%3c ascended to Bina to receive the property of mercy (bestowal) from her, Bat Sheva, %0a%3c too, required this correction in GAR. Without it she could not have given birth %0a%3c to the soul of King Solomon. %0a%3c %0a%3c And Uriah the Hittite was an exalted soul, the properties of GAR, wherefrom %0a%3c the name "Uriah," which consists of Ur = Ohr (Light) and i(a)h = i (Yod) + h (Hey) = %0a%3c the first two letters of the Creator's Name HaVaYaH, is derived. In other words, %0a%3c Uriah signifies "the Creator's Light." And the fact that his name contains only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 291 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the first two letters Yod-Hey = Hochma-Bina, and lacks the last two letters Vav- %0a%3c Hey = ZA-Malchut indicates that his Light is the Light of GAR. Therefore, to %0a%3c correct Bat Sheva in the property of mercy, she was joined with Uriah. As a %0a%3c result, she became fit for queenship, and became the Queen of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c 133. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, what is revealed to You is %0a%3c concealed from him." The Creator answered: "Whatever David did was done %0a%3c with My permission. For no man goes to war without first giving his wife a get %0a%3c (document of divorce)." Domeh then said: "But if this is so, David should have %0a%3c waited three months, which he did not." The Creator replied: "This extension %0a%3c is only necessary to make certain that the woman is not pregnant from her %0a%3c previous husband. But it is known to Me that Uriah never went near her, for %0a%3c My Name is imprinted in him as testimony. Indeed, Uriah is Ohr'lah, the %0a%3c Creator's Light, though it is written Uriahu = Ohr + i + a + hu (Yod-Hey-Vav), %0a%3c without the last Hey, MalcHut, which proves that he did not use Malcfutt." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Yod-Hey in Uriah's name (Aleph-Reish-Yod-Hey) indicate that he %0a%3c had never touched Bat Sheva. This is because Uriah refers to GAR without %0a%3c VAK. And The Zohar emphasizes that whenever VAK is used, the name Uriahu %0a%3c is applied. However, it is written here that Uriah was Bat Sheva's first husband, %0a%3c meaning that he had nothing of VAK in him, but only GAR— the Light of Hochma %0a%3c without the Light of Hassadim, for Vav signifies Hassadim. This is why he could %0a%3c not come near Bath Sheba. %0a%3c %0a%3c 134. Domeh said to Him: "Master of the World, this is exactly what I have %0a%3c said: if You knew that Uriah had never laid with her, then who revealed it to %0a%3c David? He should have waited three months. And if You will say that David %0a%3c knew that Uriah had never laid with her, why did he send Uriah to his wife, %0a%3c saying: 'Go down to your house, and wash your feet?'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Usually the readers of the To rah give this example of "a love triangle %0a%3c evidence of King David's less than exalted qualities and of the inconsistent %0a%3c the Creator's judgment— how He forgave David for "killing" Uriah, and so forth. %0a%3c We must remember that the Torah speaks only of the spiritual worlds and their %0a%3c laws, which have no obvious consequences in our world. There is a cause-and- %0a%3c effect connection: whatever occurs in our world is a result of a Higher cause, but %0a%3c no way is it vice versa, i.e., whatever is described in the Upper World does not %0a%3c sarily need to manifest in ours. To consider the Torah a narrative abo %0a%3c relegates the Torah of the world of Atzilut, the Creator's holy na: %0a%3c the Creator's Light, to the lowest level of creation, which is strictly forbid %0a%3c "Do not make an idol for yourself." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c le" as %0a%3c icy of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ibout %0a%3c im e S , %0a%3c Iden: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 292 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 135. He replied to him: "Of course, David did not know, but he waited more %0a%3c than three months, as four months had passed." As we have learned, on the %0a%3c 15 th day of Nissan, David ordered all the people of Israel to prepare for war, %0a%3c Yoav— on seventh day of Nissan. They conquered the lands of Moav and %0a%3c remained there for four months, until he went to Bat Sheva in the month %0a%3c of Elul. And on Yom Kippur, the Creator forgave him his sin. But there are %0a%3c those who say that David dispatched his orders on the seventh day of Adar, %0a%3c the troops assembled on the 15 th day of lyar, he went to Bat Sheva on the %0a%3c 15 th day of Elul, and on Yom Kippur the Creator forgave him and spared him %0a%3c from death at the hands of the angel Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Domeh is in charge of adultery. And since David was forgiven on the Day of %0a%3c Atonement, he thereby escaped death at the hands of Domeh. However, death %0a%3c was a consequence of Uriah's death at the hands of Amon's sons, as is recorded %0a%3c in the book of Kings (Melachim, 1, 15:5), "For David did that which was right in %0a%3c the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from anything that He commanded %0a%3c him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." %0a%3c %0a%3c 136. Domeh said: "Master of the World, I have nonetheless one claim %0a%3c against him: why did he open his mouth and say: 'The Lord is righteous, %0a%3c for a mortal does so,' thus condemning himself to death. Hence, I have the %0a%3c power to bring death upon him." The Creator replied to him: "You are %0a%3c not allowed to bring death upon him, for he has repented and confessed: 'I %0a%3c have sinned before the Creator,' even though he did not sin. But he did sin %0a%3c in one matter— the killing of Uriah. I have recorded his punishment, and %0a%3c he had received it." Then Domeh immediately gave up his complaints, and %0a%3c returned, despondent, to his place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The last letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH has two points— restriction %0a%3c (strictness) and mercy. And all the corrections of Malchut with the help of the %0a%3c covenant (circumcision) are intended to conceal strictness and reveal mercy. %0a%3c Then, the Creator's name descends into Malchut. Even though Malchut exists %0a%3c there under the ban of the first restriction (strictness and judgment), and all %0a%3c the impure forces cling onto her, this point is nonetheless concealed, and only %0a%3c Bina's property of mercy is revealed. Thus, the impure forces-desires, which are %0a%3c foreign to holiness and spirituality, are powerless and cannot cling to her. %0a%3c %0a%3c To violate the covenant means to reveal the strictness and judgment in %0a%3c Malchut (the letter Hey). As a result, the impure forces immediately cling to her, for %0a%3c this is their property— a part of them. The holy soul, the Creator's name, thereby %0a%3c disappears at once, as it is written (lyov, 4:9): "By the breath of God they perish." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 293 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c David himself is the part of Malchut related to Malchut's property of mercy. %0a%3c Hence, he requires special care so as to prevent Malchut's property of strictness %0a%3c from being revealed in him. For he who reveals the property of strictness and %0a%3c violates the covenant with the Creator, surrenders himself to the impure forces, %0a%3c which condemn him to death. This is because the property of strictness reveals %0a%3c itself within him before the impure force (the angel Domeh), who wished to %0a%3c cling to David's soul and drag it to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although he was innocent, David begged the Creator's forgiveness for adultery, %0a%3c and received it. But with regard to David sending Uriah to his death, Domeh had %0a%3c no right to ask the Creator for punishment, as he is only in charge of adultery. %0a%3c %0a%3c 137. And David said to this: "Were it not for the Creator's help, Domeh had %0a%3c nearly claimed my soul." "Were it not for the Creator's help" means "had the %0a%3c Creator not been my guard and guide against the angel Domeh." "Nearly" %0a%3c means that only the distance as thin as a thread remained for Domeh to drag %0a%3c my soul to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c David is Malchut, of whom it is written (Mishley, 5:5): "Her feet descend to %0a%3c death," for she is the end, conclusion of holiness (the spiritual). The impure %0a%3c forces originate in Malchut, and she sustains them, as it is said (Tehilim, 103:19): %0a%3c "His kingdom rules over all." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Malchut exists in her corrected property of mercy (item 122), %0a%3c she is defined as consisting of two points: her own point of judgment and the %0a%3c point of mercy that she received from Bina. Her point of judgment is concealed, %0a%3c while the point of mercy is revealed. And thanks to this correction, all that the %0a%3c impure forces can get from Malchut is a Ner Dakik (tiny luminescence), which %0a%3c only sustains their existence, but does not allow for their spreading. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ner Dakik, the source of existence for the impure forces, is also known as %0a%3c Hoteh Dakik, a small sin, the root of sins, as it is written (Talmud, Sukkah, 52:1): %0a%3c "Initially, the impure force seems as thin as a spider web, but then grows as %0a%3c thick as a shaft." And it is called small (Dakik), for judgment and restrictions are %0a%3c concealed within the property (point) of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, he who violates the covenant causes the point of judgment in %0a%3c Malchut to be revealed. As a result, the impure forces cling to Malchut and draw %0a%3c much Light from her, thus receiving the strength to spread and expand. And he %0a%3c who does so is said to be forsaking his own soul, as it is written: "By the breath %0a%3c of God they perish" (lyov, 4:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c And when he merits returning to the Creator, he returns and corrects %0a%3c Malchut with the property of mercy. This is why this process is called Teshuva %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 294 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (return), from the word of Tashuv (to return) + "A," where "A" (Hey) designates %0a%3c the Creator. In other words, it is the return to the property of mercy, whereas %0a%3c the property of judgment goes back to being concealed in the property of mercy, %0a%3c like a small candle, and nothing more. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, %0a%3c referring to His acceptance of my return and repelling the angel Domeh by %0a%3c bringing Malchut back to her place (to the property) of mercy, reducing the %0a%3c property of judgment to a mere small candle, a hair's-breadth fire, whose LIGHT %0a%3c SEPARATES ME FROM THE IMPURE FORCE. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is that minimal Light that must always remain between Malchut and %0a%3c the impure force, so as to allow Malchut to exist and be sustained by this small %0a%3c Light, called "small sin," so small that DOMEH WOULD NOT DRAG MY %0a%3c SOUL TO HELL FOR IT. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is precisely the magnitude of this Light that saved me from the hands %0a%3c of Domeh, for had the property of judgment not returned to Malchut in the %0a%3c measure of a small sin, I would have fallen into the hands of Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c 138. Therefore, man should be careful not to say what David said, for one %0a%3c cannot say to the angel Domeh that "It was an error" (Kohelet, 5:5), as it was %0a%3c with David, when the Creator won the dispute against Domeh. "Why should %0a%3c the Creator be angry over your word" (Kohelet, 5:5), i.e., for what you have %0a%3c said. "Destroyed the work of your hands" (Kohelet, 5:5) i.e., the sacred flesh, %0a%3c the holy covenant, which you have broken, and are therefore to be dragged to %0a%3c hell by the angel Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two ways to return to the Creator ("Introduction to the Study of %0a%3c the Ten Sefirot," items 45, 59, 64; Talmud, Yoma, 86:2): %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) Repentance out of fear, when intentional sins become unintentional, %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) Repentance out of love, when intentional sins become merits. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, when the forces of strictness, restriction, and %0a%3c judgment are still needed in the world, as it is written (Kohelet, 3:14), "The %0a%3c Creator hath so made it that man should fear Him," Malchut must sustain the %0a%3c existence of the impure forces as Ner Dakik, so they will not disappear from %0a%3c the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at such a time (in this state), Malchut's corrections are made in %0a%3c two points: mercy and judgment. However, judgment is concealed, while mercy %0a%3c acts openly. This is why the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is feared: if %0a%3c man is worthy— it is good, if not— it is evil (items 120-124). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 295 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, DURING THE 6,000 YEARS, WE RETURN TO THE %0a%3c CREATOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR, which causes our intentional sins to turn %0a%3c into unintentional ones— errors. As a result of our repentance, we bring Malchut %0a%3c back to the property of mercy. But strictness and judgment are concealed in her %0a%3c to the extent of a small candle (small sin), since Malchut must still remain in the %0a%3c property of fear. Hence, this return is called "the return out of fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c The small sin that must remain is also called "unintentional sin," an "error," %0a%3c a "mistake," for it is not regarded as a sin in and of itself. Rather, it only leads %0a%3c man to commit an unintentional sin. Man sins intentionally only after having %0a%3c first committed an unintentional sin: he committed something unintentionally, %0a%3c but it turned out that he has sinned. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, this small sin remains in Malchut, but although it remains, it is not %0a%3c really considered a sin. Yet, through this concealed judgment and strictness %0a%3c we come to intentional sins. This is why it is said: "Initially, it is as a hair's- %0a%3c breadth," i.e., like a small sin. But then, unless we properly guard our covenant, %0a%3c it "becomes as thick as a shaft," as the property of strictness and judgment %0a%3c becomes revealed in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that Domeh stands at the gates of hell, as the power of a %0a%3c small sin is only an entrance, for it is said that it looks as thin as a spider web. %0a%3c Therefore, our repentance is called "forgiven sins," which turn into unintentional %0a%3c errors, as though they were mistakes. For a small sin remains, which is capable %0a%3c of leading us to intentional sins. %0a%3c %0a%3c All this refers to the repentance out of fear, whereas the second kind is the %0a%3c repentance out of love, when intentional sins turn to merits (item 126). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, MAN SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO SAY WHAT DAVID %0a%3c SAID, i.e., not to utter the word that causes the property of judgment in Malchut %0a%3c to be revealed (as David had done). FOR ONE CANNOT SAY TO THE ANGEL %0a%3c DOMEH THAT IT WAS AN ERROR, for he is unsure as to whether he can %0a%3c return to the Creator right away, so that his sin would be forgiven and made %0a%3c unintentional, AS IT WAS WITH DAVID, WHEN THE CREATOR WON %0a%3c THE DISPUTE AGAINST DOMEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c It happened with David because throughout his life all of his actions before %0a%3c the Creator were pure, he had committed no crimes, and the only exception was %0a%3c his act toward Uriah. Hence, the Creator became his defender, and helped him %0a%3c return to Him at once, and his sin was turned into an error, as it is said in The %0a%3c Zohar (item 137): WERE IT NOT FOR THE CREATOR'S HELP, DOMEH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 296 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HAD NEARLY CLAIMED MY SOUL. But other people should fear this angel, %0a%3c for an unintentional sin may lead them to hell at the hands of Domeh. %0a%3c %0a%3c DESTROYED THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS, THE SACRED FLESH, %0a%3c THE HOLY COVENANT, WHICH YOU HAVE VIOLATED, AND ARE %0a%3c THEREFORE TO BE DRAGGED TO HELL BY THE ANGEL DOMEH. %0a%3c The correction in us called "the holy covenant" is regarded as "the work of %0a%3c our hands," as it is written: "Confirm the work of our hands." The holy soul %0a%3c is called the sacred flesh, as it is said, "Out of my flesh shall I see the Creator" %0a%3c (lyov, 19:26) (item 131). Because of the revelation of the property of strictness %0a%3c and judgment in Malchut, the correction of the covenant was corrupted, and %0a%3c Domeh drags the soul to hell. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS %0a%3c (item 130). In the end of correction, the Heavens will declare the work of His %0a%3c hands, as the reward for all these corrections will be revealed. It will become %0a%3c clear that this was THE WORK OF HIS HANDS, and NOT OURS', and THE %0a%3c HEAVENS DECLARE this. And the great Zivug RAV PAALIM U MEKABTZIEL %0a%3c will be made on these actions (corrections) (item 92). DECLARE refers to the %0a%3c Light's descent from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c Know that this is the only difference in our world before and after the end of %0a%3c correction. Before the end of correction, Malchut is called the Tree of Knowledge %0a%3c of Good and Evil, for Malchut is the revelation of the Creator's governance over %0a%3c this world. And until people achieve the state where they can receive His Light %0a%3c (as He conceived and prepared for everyone back at the Thought of Creation), %0a%3c the world will be ruled by good and evil, by reward and punishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that our Kelim de Kabbalah (vessels of reception) are %0a%3c impure, stained by egoism, which (i) prevents the Creator's Light from filling %0a%3c theses desires, and (ii) separates us from the Creator. And the infinite goodness %0a%3c that He has prepared for us may only be received in altruistic desires, for these %0a%3c delights are not limited by the bounds of creation, like egoistic pleasures, in %0a%3c which fulfillment instantly douses the pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written: "The Creator hath made everything for His own glory" %0a%3c (Mishley, 16:4), i.e., all the deeds in the world were initially created by Him %0a%3c so that we could please Him. Therefore, people in our world are engaged in %0a%3c things that are totally opposite from what they should be doing, according to the %0a%3c purpose of their creation. After all, the Creator clearly states that He created the %0a%3c world for Himself: "I have created it for My glory" (Yeshayahu, 43:7). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 297 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, we claim the exact opposite— that the whole world was created for us, %0a%3c and we desire to swallow it whole, for our own pleasure, satisfaction, indulgence, %0a%3c and exaltation. So it is no surprise we are unworthy of receiving the Creator's %0a%3c perfect goodness. And thus He rules over us through good and evil, in the %0a%3c form of reward and punishment, for one depends on the other: reward and %0a%3c punishment give rise to good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because we use our desires to receive (pleasure), thus becoming opposite %0a%3c m the Creator, we perceive His governance towards us as evil. This stems fn %0a%3c at man cannot perceive obvious evil from the Creator, as this w %0a%3c dermine the creatures' perception of the great and perfect Creator, fo %0a%3c one cannot create evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, to the extent that man feels bad and evil, and denies the Divine %0a%3c Providence, a veil immediately falls over him, and the sensation of the Creator's %0a%3c existence disappears. This is the worst punishment in the world! %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the sensation of good and evil in the Creator's governance gives us %0a%3c a feeling of reward and punishment. This is because he who exerts efforts not to %0a%3c lose faith in the Creator's existence and governance, even if he tastes evil in His %0a%3c governance, is rewarded with finding strength to not lose faith in the governance %0a%3c and good purpose of the Creator's "evil" influence. But if he had not yet merited %0a%3c the opportunity to exert efforts in believing that the Creator pursues a definite %0a%3c purpose by sending him unpleasant sensations, he is punished with remoteness %0a%3c from faith in the Creator and the sensation of His existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, although He has done, is doing, and will do all the deeds in the %0a%3c world, it remains semi-concealed from those who perceive both good and evil. %0a%3c For when they perceive evil, the impure force is allowed to conceal the Creator's %0a%3c governance and faith in Him. Thus, man suffers the worst punishment in the %0a%3c world— the sensation of detachment from the Creator— and becomes filled with %0a%3c doubts and denial of the Creator's existence and governance. And when he %0a%3c returns to the Creator, he receives a corresponding reward, and is able to unite %0a%3c with Him once again. %0a%3c %0a%3c But through this very governance of reward and punishment, the Creator %0a%3c has prepared for us the opportunity to utilize this governance in order to achieve %0a%3c the end of correction, when all people attain their corrected Kelim (desires), and %0a%3c use them to bring pleasure to the Creator, as it is written that He has created %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the great Zivug of Atik will be revealed, we will all return to the Creator %0a%3c out of love, all our intentional sins will turn to merits, all evil will be felt as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 298 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c infinite goodness, and His Divine Providence will be revealed in the entire %0a%3c world. Thus, ALL SHALL SEE that only He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a%3c the deeds in the world, and that no one acts besides Him. After the sensation of %0a%3c evil and punishment is turned to one of goodness and reward, and our egoistic %0a%3c desires become altruistic, we are given the opportunity to attain the Maker, for %0a%3c we conform to the work of His hands by blessing and exalting Him above all evil %0a%3c and all punishments we had once suffered. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the most important point to stress here is that until the end %0a%3c of correction, all the corrections were considered as THE WORK OF OUR %0a%3c HANDS. This is why we receive rewards or punishments for them. But in the %0a%3c great Zivug at the end of correction, it will be revealed that all the corrections %0a%3c and all the punishments are THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it is said, THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. %0a%3c This is because the great Zivug signifies what the Heavens will declare, that all %0a%3c the deeds are the work of His hands, that He has done, is doing, and will do all %0a%3c the deeds in the whole of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 139. Thus, "the Heavens declare the work of His hands." These are the friends %0a%3c who have united in the bride (Malchut) by studying the Torah on the night %0a%3c of the holiday of Shavuot. They are all participants of the covenant with her, %0a%3c and are called "the work of His hands." And she praises and notes each and %0a%3c every one of them. What is Heaven, firmament? It is the firmament, where %0a%3c the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiac are located. This firmament is %0a%3c called the Book of Remembrance, and it declares and records them, so they %0a%3c shall become the sons of His palace, and He will fulfill all their desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod of Zeir Anpin, onto which a Zivug is made for the revelation of all %0a%3c the Supernal Degrees, called the sun, the moon, the stars, and the signs of the %0a%3c zodiac, is referred to as the "firmament." All of the Supernal stars exist on the %0a%3c firmament, called Yesod of Zeir Anpin. And everything exists thanks to it, for it %0a%3c makes a Zivug with Nukva, called earth, and shines upon her with all these stars, %0a%3c i.e., gives these stars to her. %0a%3c %0a%3c It turns out that Malchut is smaller than the sun (ZA). But at the end of %0a%3c correction, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light %0a%3c of the sun will be seventy times greater than before— Malchut will become as %0a%3c big as Zeir Anpin during the six days of creation. When will this be? Rabbi %0a%3c Yehuda answers: on the day when death disappears forever, and the Creator %0a%3c and His Name are as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 299 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Heaven or the firmament (ZA) is HaVaYaH, called "the sun." Malchut %0a%3c (Nukva) receives from it, and is called "the moon." During the 6,000 years, %0a%3c Malchut receives the Light from the six days of creation, but Zeir Anpin does not %0a%3c reveal that the Creator and His Name are one. Hence, the moon is smaller than %0a%3c the sun. Its lesser size is a result of Malchut's consisting of both good and evil, %0a%3c reward and punishment. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a considerable difference between "Him" and "His Name." "His %0a%3c Name" is Malchut, where all the Zivugim, and all the states of unification and %0a%3c separation are accumulated. But at the end of correction, when death is said to %0a%3c disappear forever, HaVaYaH and His Name will be one. The Name (Malchut) %0a%3c will be like the Light of Zeir Anpin— only goodness without evil, and the private %0a%3c governance will be revealed in her, which means that the light of the moon will %0a%3c become equal to that of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore at this time (in this state), Nukva will be called "the Book of %0a%3c Remembrance," for all human deeds are recorded in her. Yesod of Zeir Anpin is %0a%3c called "remembrance," for it remembers the deeds of the entire world, studies, %0a%3c and analyzes all the creatures that receive from it. %0a%3c %0a%3c During the 6,000 years before the end of correction, the Book of %0a%3c Remembrance exists sometimes together and sometimes separately. But at the %0a%3c end of correction, these two degrees will merge into one, and Malchut herself %0a%3c will be called "the Book of Remembrance," when ZA and Malchut become a %0a%3c single whole, for Malchut's Light will equal that of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the firmament is a place where the sun, the moon, the stars, %0a%3c and the signs of the zodiac are located. The firmament is Yesod of ZA, which %0a%3c emanates all the Light of the world and sustains all existence. It passes the Light %0a%3c onto Malchut when she is smaller than it, and the state, "He and His Name are %0a%3c one" has not yet been achieved. And at the end of correction, it will be exactly %0a%3c like Malchut, who is hence called the Book of Remembrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, when Malchut receives all the properties of Zeir Anpin (the firmament, %0a%3c called "Remembrance"), she will become the Book of Remembrance, i.e., she %0a%3c and the firmament will be one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 140. Day after day brings Omer— a sheaf. The holy day out of those days %0a%3c (Sefirot) of the King (Zeir Anpin) praises the friends, who study the Torah %0a%3c on the night of Shavuot. They say to each other, "Day after day shall bring %0a%3c a sheaf," and praise it. And the words "night after night" refer to all the %0a%3c degrees, Sefirot of Malchut, that reign in the night, praise one another by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 300 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c each receiving from a friend, from another Sefira. And the state of complete %0a%3c perfection makes them beloved friends. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having explained that THE HEAVENS DECLARE THE WORK OF HIS %0a%3c HANDS is THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE. The Zohar continues to clarify the %0a%3c writings in the Book ofMalachi (3:14-16): "You have said, 'How futile it is to serve %0a%3c the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted %0a%3c before Him— what is the use of it all? And now we regard the wicked as blessed: %0a%3c they have settled in their wickedness, tried the Creator, and were liberated.' Then %0a%3c those who feared the Creator spoke WITH EACH OTHER, and the Creator %0a%3c hearkened and heard, and a BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE was recorded before %0a%3c Him for those who fear the Creator (every day) and honor His (holy) name. %0a%3c And they shall become chosen for Me,'— the Lord said,— 'on the day that I shall %0a%3c determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,— on %0a%3c the day that I shall work a miracle, on the day of the end of correction.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, before we prepare our desires "to receive" only %0a%3c for the Creator's sake, and not for self-gratification, Malchut is called "The Tree %0a%3c of Knowledge of Good and Evil," for Malchut governs the world in accordance %0a%3c with man's deeds. Inasmuch as we are not yet ready to receive all the delight that %0a%3c the Creator prepared for us in His Thought of Creation, we have no choice but %0a%3c to submit to Malchut's governance of good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this very governance prepares us for the eventual correction of our %0a%3c desires to receive (Kelim de Kabbalah) into desires for bestowal (Kelim de Hashpaa), %0a%3c thus achieving the goodness and delight that He conceived to bestow upon us. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was previously stated, the sensation of good and evil creates in us a %0a%3c feeling of reward and punishment. Therefore, when one tries to retain his faith %0a%3c in the Creator while he is feeling evil, but still continues to observe the Torah %0a%3c and Mitzvot as he did before, he is rewarded. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if he cannot overcome this test and is distanced from the Creator, he %0a%3c becomes filled with doubts with regard to the good governance. Alternatively, he %0a%3c stops believing that the Creator governs the world altogether, or feels resentment %0a%3c towards the Creator in response to these unpleasant sensations. The Creator pun- %0a%3c ishes for all thoughts, just as He does for all actions (Talmud, Kidushim, 40:1). %0a%3c %0a%3c It is also said that one's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his %0a%3c sin. But sometimes man's doubts are so overpowering that he regrets even the %0a%3c good deeds he had previously done, and says (Malachi, 3:14): "You have said, %0a%3c 'How futile it is to serve the Creator! When we carried out the Creator's will, %0a%3c and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what is the use of it all?'" He becomes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 301 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a complete sinner, who regrets his righteous past (complaining that he wasted %0a%3c time and effort instead of enjoying this world like the others!), and his doubts %0a%3c and regrets cause him to lose all of his good deeds, as the Torah warns us: %0a%3c "One's righteousness is of no help to him on the day of his sin." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, even in this state, man can return to the Creator. However, he is said %0a%3c to be beginning on his path anew, as though he is a newborn, for all of his past %0a%3c good deeds are gone. %0a%3c %0a%3c One should not take the aforesaid literally, even in its spiritual context, for %0a%3c he who works to achieve unconditional altruistic deeds constantly experiences %0a%3c descents and ascents, is filled with doubts, and tries to overcome them. Only %0a%3c one who advances in this manner feels that he is starting his work every time %0a%3c anew, that he understands no more than a newborn baby. Conversely, one who %0a%3c belongs to the masses— who works in his egoistic desires— is constantly filled with %0a%3c self-reverence and thinks that on each new day, he adds to the previous one, and %0a%3c nothing seems to disappear. This makes his spiritual growth impossible. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only one who truly ascends the spiritual degrees feels like a newborn baby %0a%3c before his Creator at each moment. After all, as he ascends from one degree to %0a%3c the next, the previous state (degree) disappears, and until he attains a Higher %0a%3c Degree, he is in total darkness and feels that he is starting from scratch, rather %0a%3c than supplementing his assets, which is how the spiritually inanimate (Domem %0a%3c de Kedusha) feel. %0a%3c %0a%3c The governance of good and evil causes us to ascend and descend— each in %0a%3c his own way... Each ascent is considered a separate day (sensation of Light). As a %0a%3c result of the great descent that he has just undergone by regretting his past good %0a%3c deeds, man moves into a state of ascent, as one who is born anew. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at each ascent, it is as though one starts over on his path to the %0a%3c Creator. Thus, each ascent is regarded as a separate day, for there is a break (night) %0a%3c between these states. And each descent is hence considered a separate night. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is what The Zohar tells us: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A %0a%3c SHEAF— in each ascent we draw nearer to the Creator's greatest day (the end %0a%3c of correction), HE PRAISED THE FRIENDS AND THEY WOULD SPEAK %0a%3c WITH EACH OTHER. This is because through the great Zivug at the end of %0a%3c correction, they will all merit returning to the Creator out of love, for the desire %0a%3c "to receive" will be completely corrected, and they will begin to receive only for %0a%3c the Creator's sake, so as to bestow delight upon Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this great Zivug (unity), we will reveal all the supreme goodness and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c delight of the Thought of Creation. And we will tl %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c th %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 302 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its would %0a%3c he direct %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lose punishments we experienced in the states of descent, which %0a%3c t and regret the efforts exerted in the Torah, all those punishments %0a%3c rrect and purify us. And now, at the end of correction, they are the %0a%3c se for our sensation and reception of the Creator's goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Had it not been for the terrible suffering and punishments, we would not %0a%3c have been able to achieve the state of being filled with perfect delight. Therefore, %0a%3c even these intentional sins turn into merits, as it is said: DAY AFTER DAY %0a%3c ULL BRING A SHEAF— each ascent in Malchut, up to the end of correction, %0a%3c %0a%3c This day is revealed by the word, which supports the Torah in all its greatness. %0a%3c What is this word? When they say, "How futile it is to serve the Creator! When %0a%3c we carried out the Creator's will, and walked heavy-hearted before Him— what %0a%3c is the use of it all?" %0a%3c %0a%3c These words brought punishments that have now become merits, for all %0a%3c the perfection and magnificence of that great day can now be revealed thanks %0a%3c to these very punishments of the past. Thus, those who uttered these words are %0a%3c now regarded as those who fear the Creator and praise His Name. (And these %0a%3c words could only have been spoken by those who made efforts to advance on %0a%3c the Path of Truth, and felt frustrated upon receiving uncorrected egoism of a %0a%3c Higher Degree. In other words, frustration comes only to those who truly work %0a%3c for the Creator's sake.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said about them: "The Lord said, 'On the day that I shall %0a%3c determine, and I shall spare them, as a man spares his son, who serves him,'" %0a%3c for all the nights— states of descent, suffering and punishments, which sever %0a%3c their connection with the Creator— now become merits and good deeds. And %0a%3c the night turns into day, darkness turns into Light, and there are no divisions %0a%3c between days, and all 6,000 years gather into one great day. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the Zivugim that were made one after another, revealed the ascents %0a%3c and the separate, consecutive degrees, have now gathered into one degree of %0a%3c one great Zivug— Unity, which shines in the world from end to end. Hence, it %0a%3c is written: DAY AFTER DAY SHALL BRING A SHEAF, that is, the intervals %0a%3c between days now become magnificent glory, for they have been turned into %0a%3c merits. Thus, everything becomes the Creator's one glorious day! %0a%3c %0a%3c And the words "night after night" refer to all the degrees that reign in the %0a%3c night. They praise one another, and each receives everything that man feels as %0a%3c suffering in a state of descent— this is called night. And through such sensations, %0a%3c intervals are formed between the sensations of day. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 303 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c , now %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the whole, each degree is separated from one another. Night %0a%3c to attain the Creator. And while each night is full of darkness, %0a%3c all the nights (states of feeling emptiness, hopelessness, heaviness of efforts, the %0a%3c Creator's concealment) gather together and form a unified vessel of reception %0a%3c of Supernal wisdom, which fills the entire earth with Knowledge of the Creator, %0a%3c and the nights shine like days. %0a%3c %0a%3c For each night receives its own part of Knowledge only by joining with the %0a%3c ther nights. Thus, each night is said to help the other nights in the Knowledge, %0a%3c differently, man is ready to receive the Knowledge only if he joins with th %0a%3c nights. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since night is a feeling of lacking knowledge, attainment, and sensation %0a%3c )f the Creator by uniting, they form a perfect vessel of reception of the Knowledge %0a%3c of the Creator. And they praise one another, for each has received his share of %0a%3c the Knowledge of the Creator thanks exclusively to his friend, through uniting %0a%3c 1. Only in unity do they merit reception of the Supernal Knowledge, %0a%3c aid that through the perfection achieved by all, the nights becam%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 141. Does he speak of the others in the world who do not obey the Creator, %0a%3c and whom He does not wish to hear? But they made lines through all the %0a%3c earth, that is, these things make a line out of those that reside Above and out %0a%3c of those that reside below. From the first— firmaments are made, and from the %0a%3c second, from their return— earth. And should you say that they revolve around %0a%3c the earth in one place, it is said that they are also at the end of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus far, we have discussed the most terrible punishments and suffering in %0a%3c the world— being detached from the Creator and losing faith in Him. Moreover, %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that all the punishments, all the suffering of hell and of the %0a%3c body, which stem from personal sins and fill this world, also gather and are %0a%3c included into one great Zivug, as it is written: "And it shall come to pass, that as %0a%3c the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will %0a%3c rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you" (Devarim, 28:63). %0a%3c %0a%3c All will gather and become one great Light, and everything will turn to %0a%3c great joy and bliss. It is therefore said that THERE IS NO SHEAF AND NO %0a%3c THINGS IN THE OTHER WORDS OF THE WORLD, which man perceives %0a%3c in this world as suffering. But they will turn to joy and bliss, and thus the holy %0a%3c King, too, shall wish to hear them. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, all the suffering during the 6,000 years will gather at the end of correction %0a%3c and will become a tremendous delight, as the prophet said: "In those days and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 304 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in that time, said the Lord, even if the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, there %0a%3c shall be none" (Yirmiyahu, 50:20). %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything will turn to merits, so much so that they will ask and search "for %0a%3c the past sins that can be included in the Zivug, and which can be laughed at, %0a%3c for they were felt as suffering and now they are joy and bliss," but they will not %0a%3c find any. There will be no more suffering in its true form, as it was in the past, %0a%3c although they greatly desire to find it and feel it, for all suffering will have now %0a%3c been turned to great Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Supernal Degree, created by the great Zivug out of all the souls and all %0a%3c the deeds, both good and evil, is now defined as a pillar of Light, which shines %0a%3c from one end of the world to the other. And this unity is perfect, as is said by %0a%3c the prophet (Zachariah, 14:9): "And the Creator shall be one (for all), and His %0a%3c Name one"— all the senses will grasp the Creator's complete and perfect name, %0a%3c "the Infinitely good." %0a%3c %0a%3c Precisely because this most Supernal Degree is achieved as a result of %0a%3c bringing together all the suffering and punishments, it fills the entire universe %0a%3c with Light, including earth. However, it should be noted that the suffering of %0a%3c which The Zohar speaks is not the suffering of the body's lack of pleasure. It is %0a%3c the suffering caused by the absence of unity with the Creator! %0a%3c %0a%3c But if suffering is so useful, why is it written, "neither them nor the %0a%3c reward for them?" Suffering is necessary, for it is correction. However, the %0a%3c true suffering, for which man can receive the degree of the end of correction, %0a%3c is caused by temporary distancing from the Torah and Mitzvot as a result of %0a%3c feeling the pain of suffering, and this pains the Creator. Thus, the Shechina %0a%3c suffers, for when man suffers in his heart, he speaks ill of her, willingly or %0a%3c unwillingly. Although the Torah tells him to be patient, to endure and have %0a%3c faith above reason— selfless faith that all of this is the correction that he must %0a%3c undergo— he debases the Shechina by being unwilling to endure them and %0a%3c achieve the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's soul is also a Partzuf consisting of ten Sefirot. In its initial, spiritually %0a%3c undeveloped, unborn state, the soul is defined as a point, as a potential future %0a%3c spiritual body. If man works on himself, this point within him gradually acquires %0a%3c a screen, and he makes a Zivug on it. He repels all the pleasures for the sake of %0a%3c the Creator's desires, and receives Light in this point. Thus, he "amplifies" it to %0a%3c the size of a Partzuf and transforms it into a body, a newborn Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterwards he continues to cultivate his screen, gradually nurturing the %0a%3c small state into the big one, until he receives all of the Light destined for him %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 305 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c by the Creator within his spiritual body. This state is called "the end of the %0a%3c personal correction." When all the personal corrections merge into one, the %0a%3c general correction of the entire world (of Malchut) will occur. Malchut is a Partzuf %0a%3c that consists of separate souls; each soul, the Partzuf of each soul, is part of %0a%3c Malchut, and Malchut is a collection, the sum of all the Partzufim that are to be %0a%3c made by all the people. To make a Partzuf is to acquire a screen and become %0a%3c filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c THOSE THAT RESIDE ABOVE AND THOSE THAT RESIDE BELOW %0a%3c refers to the order of time in the spiritual, eternal world, which is different from %0a%3c ours. When the Creator wished to create the world, He immediately created %0a%3c everything: all the souls filled with Light in a state of absolute perfection, called %0a%3c "the end of correction," where all the creatures receive the infinite delight that %0a%3c He envisioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ultimate state was born with the Creator's first thought to create the %0a%3c world, and it exists in its final form from the very first moment, for the future, %0a%3c present, and past are merged in the Creator, and the factor of time does not %0a%3c exist in Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Change of time: the stretching of time into infinity, i.e., when time %0a%3c stops and the present merges with the past and the future; when %0a%3c time reverses its course or disappears. Yet, time is the only thing that %0a%3c provides us with a perception of existence. By "switching off time, we %0a%3c stop perceiving that we exist! %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Transformation of space: expanding and contracting of space into %0a%3c point; space taking other forms, other dimensions; infinity and tota %0a%3c absence of space altogether. %0a%3c %0a%3c I've already dealt with these issues in my book, Kabbalah, Science and the %0a%3c Meaning of Life, and I would prefer not to digress from the text of The Zohar. %0a%3c However, to understand our true state, and not the one we currently perceive, it %0a%3c is essential to remember that notions of time and space do not exist with regard to %0a%3c Creator. In reality, we are completely different and exist in a completely different %0a%3c form and state from what we presently perceive. We feel this way because our %0a%3c sensations are distorted by our egoism, which infuse our senses and possess our %0a%3c bodies, like a cloud. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, all that is described in the Torah refers strictly to the spiritual %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 306 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and future, for time exists only with regard to those who are still confir %0a%3c their egoistic Kelim (desires). From this we can understand what is said %0a%3c Torah: "The Creator showed Adam each generation and its representatives, %0a%3c showed it to Moshe as well" (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 38:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, if the above described unfolded before the creation of these generations, %0a%3c how can the Creator show them to Adam and Moshe? It is possible because all %0a%3c the souls with all their destinies from the moment of their creation to the end of %0a%3c their correction emerged before the Creator in their completeness and reside in %0a%3c the Supernal Garden of Eden. From there they descend and enter the bodies %0a%3c our world, each at their own "time." And there, "Above," the Creator re %0a%3c them to Adam, Moshe, and all the others who were worthy of it. Howeve %0a%3c is a difficult notion, and not every mind is ready to grasp it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar says (Terumah, 163) that the way the six Sefirot of Zeir %0a%3c Anpin unite as ONE above Chazeh, de Zeir Anpin, where they are free from the %0a%3c Klipot, Malchut unites with Zeir Anpin below his Chazeh, so that unity exists %0a%3c below, as it does Above. For the Creator (Zeir Anpin) is One (male) Above. And %0a%3c Malchut becomes One (female), so that One (male) would be with One (female). %0a%3c This is the secret of unity expressed in the words: "He and His Name are one"; %0a%3c "He" (ZA) and "His Name" (Malchut) are within one another. %0a%3c %0a%3c The degree that is born at the end of correction, in the state of "He and %0a%3c His Name are one," already exists Above as the sum of all the 600,000 souls and %0a%3c deeds during the 6,000 degrees (called "years") in the world, which will emerge %0a%3c before the end of correction, but exist in their eternal form Above, where the %0a%3c future is as present. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the pillar of Light that will shine upon the world from one end %0a%3c to the other at the end of correction already exists in the Supernal Garden %0a%3c of Eden, which illuminates it with the same brilliance that will be revealed to %0a%3c us in the future. This is because at the end of correction the two degrees will %0a%3c shine as one, and "He and His Name will be one." A pillar (line) of Light will %0a%3c appear, made of those that reside Above (the souls that reside in the Supernal %0a%3c Garden of Eden) and those that reside below (the souls clothed in the bodies %0a%3c of our world). And "One receives One"; these two degrees shine together, and %0a%3c reveal the Creator's unity thereby, as it is said that on that day "He and His %0a%3c Name will be one." %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid one can assume that the pillar of Light that shines in %0a%3c the Supernal Garden of Eden descends and shines in the Garden of Eden of %0a%3c our world. But this is not so. Rather, FROM THE FIRST-FIRMAMENTS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 307 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ARE MADE, for this degree exits onto a Zivug of Yesod of Zeir Anpin, called %0a%3c "firmament." Therefore, all the Zivugim that ascend above the firmament shine %0a%3c upon those that receive them from the firmament and below. The degree above %0a%3c the firmament is referred to as "Heaven," and the degree that receives from the %0a%3c firmament is called "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the line (pillar) of Light unites the inhabitants of Above and those %0a%3c of below, the distinction between the Supernal Garden of Eden and the %0a%3c inhabitants of this world still remains. This is because the inhabitants of the %0a%3c Supernal Garden of Eden receive from a Zivug above the firmament, and what %0a%3c they receive is called "the new Heaven for the inhabitants of Above." And only %0a%3c a small luminescence, called "the new earth," descends below the firmament to %0a%3c the inhabitants of below. This is what The Zohar says: "From the first— firmaments %0a%3c are made, and from the second, from their return— earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although in this great Zivug, as in all Zivugim, all that is decided above the %0a%3c firmament, above the Zivug, spreads down to earth, below the line of the Zivug, %0a%3c one should not think that this Zivug (like all the previous ones) is merely a thin %0a%3c line of Light, called "one," a limited, inner place, as it is written at the beginning %0a%3c of creation: "Let the waters gather together unto one place," i.e., in the inner %0a%3c place of the worlds (and not the outer), a place of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Light of this Zivug revolves around the world and fills it whole. This %0a%3c Light reaches even the outer parts of the worlds (the nations of the world), as %0a%3c the prophet writes: "The earth shall be filled with Knowledge of the Creator" %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c 142. And since out of them Heavens were created, who resides there? He %0a%3c returned and said, "There is a shelter for the sun in them. This is the holy %0a%3c sun, called Zeir Anpin, and it dwells and resides there, and adorns itself %0a%3c with them." %0a%3c %0a%3c 143. Since Zeir Anpin resides in those firmaments and clothes in them, he %0a%3c emerges like a bridegroom out of his wedding canopy, and rejoices and races %0a%3c along these firmaments, and exits them and enters, and races toward a tower %0a%3c in a different place. He emerges from one end of Heaven, from the Upper %0a%3c World, from the Highest place, from Bina. And his season— where is it? It is %0a%3c the opposite place below, i.e., Malchut, which is the year's season that forms %0a%3c all the ends and binds everything— from Heaven to this firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar speaks of the great secret of the sun coming out of its hiding. It is %0a%3c worth noting that Kabbalists often use the word "secret" only to explain and as %0a%3c if reveal the mystery in the passages that follow. The reader should nevertheless %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 308 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i that there are no secrets in the world. Man attains everything frc %0a%3c in our world, in the process of his mental development, %0a%3c attains new notions on every new degree. And whatever he considered %0a%3c only yesterday now becomes clear and revealed before him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same is true with regard to spiritual attainments. Kabbalah is called a %0a%3c secret wisdom, for it is concealed from ordinary people, it is a secret to them. But %0a%3c as soon as one acquires a screen and begins to perceive the spiritual world, he %0a%3c sees the secret becomes a reality. And this process continues until he completely %0a%3c attains the entire universe, all of the Creator's secrets ("Introduction to the %0a%3c Study of the Ten Sefirot," item 148). %0a%3c %0a%3c The sun emerges from its hiding (sheath— Nartik), from under the Huppah, %0a%3c and rushes to a tower at a different place— after the great Zivug under the Huppah. %0a%3c Zeir Anpin leaves his hiding and enters Malchut, called the tower of Oz (strength) %0a%3c of the Creator's Name, for Malchut then ascends and unites with ZA, and they %0a%3c become as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The end of Malchut is called "the year's season." And until the end of %0a%3c correction, the impure forces, called "the end of days," attach themselves to %0a%3c it. Now, after the end of correction, it is still necessary to correct this part of %0a%3c Malchut, called "the end of days." To this end, the sun emerges from its hiding, %0a%3c LIKE THE BRIDEGROOM EMERGING FROM UNDER THE HUPPAH, %0a%3c and shines, and enters the tower of Oz (Malchut), races and shines on all the %0a%3c ends of Malchut to correct "the year's season" of the lower end of Heaven. %0a%3c %0a%3c For this last action corrects all the ends of Malchut and unites all from the %0a%3c Heavens to the firmament. In other words, Malchut receives the Light of THE %0a%3c END OF HEAVENS above the firmament (ZA). %0a%3c %0a%3c 144. There is nothing hidden on account of the year's season and the phase %0a%3c of the sun that revolves in all directions. And there is no concealment, i.e., %0a%3c not a single Supernal Degree is hidden from him, for all were bound together %0a%3c and everyone appeared before him, and none could be concealed from him. %0a%3c Thanks to him and thanks to them he returned to them, to the friends, in the %0a%3c phase of complete return and correction. All this year and all this time is for %0a%3c the Torah (to study it), as it is written: "The Creator's Torah is perfect." %0a%3c %0a%3c After the great Zivug, a restriction was imposed on all the Upper Light %0a%3c (item 94). Therefore, a new Zivug (TOWER) is necessary, which reveals anew %0a%3c all of the Upper Light that was concealed on account of the disappearance of %0a%3c the degree of BON, before it begins to ascend to SAG. Thus, NOTHING IS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 309 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CONCEALED FROM THAT PHASE OF THE SUN THAT REVOLVES IN %0a%3c ALL DIRECTIONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, a Zivug between the phase of the sun and the year's season corrects %0a%3c the ends of Malchut on all sides, until the correction is completed. Thus, BON %0a%3c ascends and becomes like SAG, which amounts to the complete correction %0a%3c of BON, whereupon THERE IS NO CONCEALMENT, NOT A SINGLE %0a%3c SUPERNAL DEGREE IS CONCEALED FROM HIM, for all the degrees and %0a%3c the Upper Light are once more revealed in their perfection. AND NOTHING %0a%3c CAN BE CONCEALED FROM Him, for all the degrees and Light gradually %0a%3c return to Him, until all become revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that the revelation does not occur at once, for while in %0a%3c its phase, the sun travels and shines in sufficient measure for a COMPLETE %0a%3c RETURN, as it is written that He punishes the sinners and cures the righteous, %0a%3c whereupon they all merit the complete revelation of the Star. %0a%3c %0a%3c 145. The word HdVaYaH is written six times, and there are six verses from %0a%3c "the Heavens declare" and until "The Creator's Torah is perfect" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 19:2-8). And this is the secret of the word BERESHEET, which consists of %0a%3c six letters: THE CREATOR CREATED ET (THE) HEAVENS AND THE %0a%3c EARTH, six words in all. The other sources of the verse from "The Creator's %0a%3c Torah is perfect" and until "they are better than gold" (Tehilim, 19:2-8) %0a%3c correspond to the six utterances of the name HaVaYaH in them. The sources %0a%3c from "the Heavens declare" through "The Creator's Torah is perfect" are for %0a%3c the six letters in the word BERESHEET, whereas the six names are for the %0a%3c six words from "the Creator created" through "the Heavens and the earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c It is known that any degree born or revealed in the worlds is first revealed %0a%3c through its letters, which signifies the, as yet, unattainable. Afterwards, it %0a%3c appears in the combination of letters. This degree then becomes attainable, %0a%3c its contents become known, as previously described with the letters RYU = 216 %0a%3c andAB = 72 (item 116). %0a%3c %0a%3c The six letters in the word BERESHEET contain everything that exists in %0a%3c Heaven and on earth, but in an unattainable form, and are hence designated by %0a%3c these letters alone, without their combinations. Then there are the six words: %0a%3c Bara Elokim Et Ha-Shamayim Ve-Et Ha-Aretz (THE CREATOR CREATED THE %0a%3c HEAVENS AND THE EARTH), where everything that the word BERESHEET %0a%3c contains (Heaven, earth, and all their inhabitants) is already attained. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same principle allows us to understand what is included in the six %0a%3c verses from "the Heavens declare" to "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 310 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c just the beginning of the revelation of attaining the end of creation in the form %0a%3c of letters, as with the six letters in the word BERESHEET. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the complete revelation, the attainment of the end of creation begins %0a%3c with the verse "The Creator's Torah is perfect." This verse contains six names, %0a%3c each of which constitutes unique attainment, thus indicating that only after the %0a%3c completion of this degree do all the letter combinations become revealed and %0a%3c attained in the great Zivug at the end of correction, as it is said, NOTHING IS %0a%3c CONCEALED IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that THE WORD BERESHEET, WHICH %0a%3c CONSISTS OF six, IS WRITTEN (SPEAKS) ABOUT THIS SECRET. The %0a%3c word BERESHEET contains six letters, where Heaven and earth are concealed, %0a%3c before they become revealed in the six words, THE CREATOR CREATED %0a%3c THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to the six verses (Tehilim, 19:2-8): the great Zivug of the %0a%3c end of correction is not yet revealed from THE HEAVENS DECLARE to THE %0a%3c CREATOR'S TORAH IS PERFECT. Only after NOTHING IS CONCEALED %0a%3c IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIM are the six names revealed, which in turn reveal %0a%3c the end of correction in its full perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c 146. As they were sitting and talking, Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, %0a%3c entered. He said to them: "Certainly, the face of the Shechina has come, hence %0a%3c I called you Pniel (Pnei-face + El-Creator = the Creator's face)" (item 119), %0a%3c for you have seen the Shechina face to face. And now that you have attained %0a%3c Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada, it certainly refers to Atik, the Sefira of Keter, just %0a%3c as everything else that occurred afterwards, as it is written in the Torah: "And %0a%3c he slew the Egyptian." And he who is concealed from all— is Atik. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said in the continuation of "The Donkey Driver," who revealed the soul %0a%3c of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba, as a result of which %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon called them Pniel. For the soul of Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada is a %0a%3c spiritual degree destined to be revealed in the future, at the end of correction. %0a%3c This is why they were in a state of concealment of the Upper Light (item 113), %0a%3c as was already mentioned with regard to the Zivug of the sun's phase and the %0a%3c year's season, until they have found Rabbi Shimon Ben Lakunya and others, %0a%3c thus meriting all the Light once again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Shimon says to them, YOU HAVE ATTAINED, %0a%3c BENAYAHU BEN-YEHOYADA WAS REVEALED TO YOU. This means %0a%3c that they have already attained the six verses, the essence of THE HEAVENS %0a%3c DECLARE, and exist in the six names. When they have attained the soul of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 311 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Benayahu Ben-Yehoyada with the help of the donkey driver, their attainment %0a%3c had not yet been revealed to them, as they still existed in the six verses— the %0a%3c reason for their concealment. But now they have attained and revealed his soul, %0a%3c that it is the great Zivug of Atik, when everything is revealed to all. %0a%3c %0a%3c 147. The words, "He slew the Egyptian" are explained in another place, i.e., %0a%3c at a different degree, in a different way. He opened and said, "He slew the %0a%3c Egyptian, a man of good stature, five cubits high." All of this refers to the %0a%3c same secret. This Egyptian is the one who is well-known and is described as %0a%3c "very great in the land of Egypt in the eyes of the Jew," for he is great and %0a%3c honored, as that old man had already explained (item 99). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah describes the killing of the Egyptian in the book Shemot (2:12). %0a%3c As we have already learned from the article about Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba, it is %0a%3c expressed differently at a different degree (in a different language, the language %0a%3c of Divrey HaYamim). However, these two verses are the same secret, for it is %0a%3c written in the book Shmuel 1 (11:23): "And he slew the Egyptian, a prominent %0a%3c man," while in Divrey HaYamim it is written: "And he slew the Egyptian, a man %0a%3c of good stature, five cubits high." Both verses are the same secret, which The %0a%3c Zohar continues to clarify. %0a%3c %0a%3c 148. This case was examined at the Divine Assembly. "A prominent man" %0a%3c and "a man of good stature" are the same, as they constitute Shabbat and %0a%3c the bounds of Shabbat. As it is written: "You shall measure it from outside %0a%3c the city." It is also written, "You shall not impede limitations in measure." %0a%3c Hence, he was a man of good stature. Precisely such, from one end of the %0a%3c world to the other. Such is he, Adam, the first man. And should you disagree, %0a%3c referring to the written "five cubits," know that these five cubits extend from %0a%3c one end of the world to the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c The matter concerns the Divine Assembly, of which Rabbi Shimon said: "I %0a%3c saw those ascending, but how few they were" (Talmud, Sukkah, 45:2). There is a %0a%3c lower assembly of the angel Matat. However, the described above takes place in %0a%3c the Supernal Assembly, which will be clarified further. %0a%3c %0a%3c "A prominent man" is the degree of Moshe, of whom it is written in the %0a%3c Torah: "And there hath not since risen a prophet in Israel such as Moshe" %0a%3c (Devarim, 34: 10), of whom it is written "My servant Moshe is not so; he is trusted %0a%3c in all My house; with him do I speak mouth to mouth, clearly, and not with %0a%3c riddles" (Bamidbar, 12:7-8). %0a%3c %0a%3c "A prominent man" also constitutes a measure, which extends from one end %0a%3c of the world to the other. Moreover, its form and size correspond to Shabbat and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 312 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the bounds of Shabbat, where the bounds of Shabbat are the end of its measure. %0a%3c During the 6,000 years, the bounds of Shabbat are limited by only 2,000 Amah %0a%3c (cubits). However, after the end of correction, the bounds of Shabbat will extend %0a%3c from one end of the world to the other, as it is written: "And the Lord shall be %0a%3c King over all the earth" (Zachariah, 14:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the Light can descend and fill the Partzufim down to the %0a%3c level of Parsa of the world of Atzilut. Shabbat is a spiritual state when the worlds %0a%3c of BYA with all that inhabit them rise above the Parsa to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c Above Parsa are only pure forces, corrected desires (Kelim). Hence, naturally %0a%3c there is no need to separate pure Kelim from impure ones and to correct them %0a%3c during Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Light of Shabbat shines not only in the world of Atzilut, but %0a%3c beyond its bounds as well. It thus affects the sixteen Sefirot from Parsa down to %0a%3c Cha^eh of the world of Yetzira so the soul can be in the state of "Shabbat" with %0a%3c these desires, too. The language of our world describes this as the permission %0a%3c to transcend the bounds of the city of Atzilut (seventy Amah) by 2,000 Amah %0a%3c down to the Chazeh of the world of Beria, and then another 2,000 Amah from %0a%3c Chazeh of the world of Beria to Chazeh of the world of Yetzira. (Seventy Amah are %0a%3c regarded as being within the city limits.) %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after all the Kelim (desires) are corrected, there will be no %0a%3c restrictions; the world of Atzilut will extend down to our world, and only the %0a%3c state of Shabbat will prevail in the entire world— in all desires of all creatures. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written: A PROMINENT MAN and A MAN OF GOOD %0a%3c STATURE are one and the same, for they constitute Shabbat and the bounds %0a%3c of Shabbat, as is said: AND YOU SHALL MEASURE FROM OUTSIDE THE %0a%3c CITY, and it is also written: YOU SHALL NOT IMPEDE JUDGMENT IN %0a%3c MEASURE. It follows that an object's measure represents its limit, just as %0a%3c the words A MAN OF GOOD STATURE alludes to the end, the bounds of %0a%3c Shabbat after the end of correction, which will extend from one end of the %0a%3c world to the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND HE SHALL BE PRECISELY MAN OF GOOD STATURE indicates %0a%3c that size does not rule over him; rather, he rules over size, and it is he who %0a%3c determines this size according to his own will. SUCH IS HE, ADAM, who, %0a%3c prior to his sin, extended and shone from one end of the world to the other %0a%3c (Talmud, Hagigah, 12:1), as the bounds of Shabbat after the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c FIVE CUBITS FROM ONE END OF THE WORLD TO THE OTHER- %0a%3c because the five cubits are the five Sefirot: Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Night of the Bride %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 313 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that expand and fill everything from one end of the world to the other after the %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 149. It is, as is written, "like a weaver's beam" (Shmuel 1, 17: 7) "as the %0a%3c Divine staff" (Shemot, 4:20) that was in his hand, which reveals by the %0a%3c secret name (Light) confirmed in it by the Light of the letter combinations %0a%3c that Betzalel and his disciples engraved, called "weaving," as is written, %0a%3c "He filled them and others, and BOUND them." And that staff— within it %0a%3c shone a secret name, inscribed on all its sides by the Light of the sages, who %0a%3c confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties. And the rest of what %0a%3c is written from here onward is similar to what the old man had already %0a%3c explained. Happy is his lot! %0a%3c %0a%3c The secret of the letter combinations in sacred names is called "weaving," %0a%3c like a weaver joins his threads into a fabric, the letters join into combinations of %0a%3c sacred names, which designate man's spiritual level of their attainment. Hence, %0a%3c The Zohar says that the Creator's staff in Moshe's hand had engraved the letter %0a%3c combinations of the secret name, which Betzalel and his disciples engraved as %0a%3c they worked on the Tabernacle. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's staff is therefore called a "weaver's beam." The Hebrew word %0a%3c for "beam" is MANOR (from OHR— Light). This refers to the Light of the letter %0a%3c combinations in the secret name, which Betzalel weaved and engraved, as it is %0a%3c said, "by the Light of the letter combinations that Betzalel engraved." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the staff does not shine in all directions until the end of correction, %0a%3c for there is a distinction between the Creator's staff and that of Moshe. It is %0a%3c written of the staff of Moshe: "Put forth your hand and take it by the tail (of a %0a%3c snake), and it shall become a staff in your hand" (Shemot, 4:4). This means that %0a%3c it did not shine from all sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after the end of correction, it will shine in all directions, as it is %0a%3c said: "And the secret name shone from within that staff in all directions by the %0a%3c Light of sages, who confirmed the secret name in forty-two properties." For the %0a%3c secret name that was engraved on the staff shone in all directions, i.e., in the %0a%3c property called "He will eradicate death forever" (Yeshayahu, 25:8). It will thus %0a%3c begin to shine evenly in all directions, whereas the Light of the name engraved %0a%3c on the staff is the Light of Hochma of the Name MB. %0a%3c %0a%3c 150. Be seated, dear friends. Be seated and let us renew the correction of the %0a%3c Bride on this night, for whomever joins her on this night shall be guarded %0a%3c Above and below in the coming year. And this year shall pass over him in %0a%3c peace. Such people are described in the verse: "The angel of the Lord stands %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 314 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c round those that fear Him, and delivers them. O taste and see that the Creator %0a%3c is good" (Tehilim, 34:8-9). %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already stated in item 125, there are two explanations of the aforesaid. %0a%3c The first is that since the day of the giving of the Torah is the Light of the end %0a%3c of correction that abolishes death forever and brings freedom from the angel of %0a%3c death, one should exert to receive this Light on the day of Shavuot (Pentecost), as %0a%3c Light is renewed on the holiday and brings deliverance from death. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the second explanation, Malchut is called a "year," and the %0a%3c renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah after the end of correction %0a%3c will also bring the complete and final correction of the year (Malchut). This is %0a%3c because the renewal of the Light by those who keep the Torah is referred to as %0a%3c the correction of the night of the bride, Malchut, called a "year." And this brings %0a%3c us to a corrected year. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 151. Rabbi Shimon opened and said, "In the beginning the Creator created %0a%3c the Heavens and the earth." This verse should be examined carefully, for %0a%3c whoever claims that there is another Creator disappears from the world, as it is %0a%3c written, "He who claims that there is another Creator perishes from both the %0a%3c earth and from Heavens, for there is no other Creator, but the Almighty." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar continues to discuss the correction of the bride. It starts %0a%3c with the first sentence of the Torah: IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED, with the root and the source of all the corrections of the bride %0a%3c (Malchut) during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut's entire correction occurs only through her union with Bina and %0a%3c the reception of Bina's properties. In the verse, IN THE BEGINNING THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED, the Creator is called Elokim, signifying Bina. This means %0a%3c that He created the world by the property of Bina for the purpose of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Elokim consists of MI-Bina and ELEH-Malchut. Thanks to the constant %0a%3c union of MI and ELEH, the world can exist. The Creator is Bina, called Elokim, %0a%3c and as a result of Ohr Hochma clothing in Ohr Hassadim, the union of MI and %0a%3c ELEH provides ELEH with the property of Bina. It is through this correction %0a%3c that the world is able to exist. %0a%3c %0a%3c The union of MI and ELEH does not permit for the existence of other, %0a%3c foreign, egoistic forces within the Partzuf. These are the so-called "other gods," %0a%3c who cannot sustain the world, as they separate MI from ELEH and do not clothe %0a%3c the Light of pleasure (Hochma) in the altruistic intention of Hassadim (for the %0a%3c Creator's sake), which leads to Ohr Hochma departing the Partzuf, leaving ELEH. %0a%3c Therefore, it is forbidden to believe that man is governed by any other forces %0a%3c besides the Creator, for instead of existence and reception of the Light of Life, %0a%3c such belief brings the world and man only ruin and disappearance of this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 315 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 316 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 152. With the exception of ELEH, everything is written in Aramaic. This is %0a%3c called "translation." He asks: However, should you suggest that it is because %0a%3c the holy angels do not understand the translation, i.e., the Aramaic language, %0a%3c then everything should have been said in Hebrew, so the holy angels would %0a%3c hear and be grateful for it. He replies: This is exactly why it is written in the %0a%3c translation (in Aramaic), as the holy angels neither hear nor understand it, %0a%3c and hence will not envy people, which would be detrimental to the latter. For %0a%3c in this case, even the holy angels are called Creators, and they are included in %0a%3c the group of Creators, but they have not created Heaven and earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aramaic is referred to as "translation." It is very close to the holy language of %0a%3c Hebrew, but angels neither need nor know it nonetheless. Yet, they know and need %0a%3c all the other languages of the nations of the world. This is so because the transla- %0a%3c tion from the holy language is called its "reverse side," its VAK without GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, there is an altruistic language, which is hence called "holy," %0a%3c and its reverse, preliminary stage, hence called "translation," is the Aramaic %0a%3c language. No other language in the world but Aramaic can act as translation %0a%3c from the holy language. All the other languages in the nations of the world %0a%3c (egoistic desires) are strictly egoistic and are unrelated to altruism. They are not %0a%3c AHP with regard to GE (the holy language). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the translation is truly close to the holy language. However, %0a%3c there is one distinction here, which renders it unnecessary to angels: the holy %0a%3c language is like the scale pointer that shows the extent of balance between %0a%3c the right and left scales, where the pointer moves between the two scales and %0a%3c delivers its judgment— toward the scale of reward (for merits) or towards the scale %0a%3c of punishment (for sins). It brings everything back to the state of correction, to %0a%3c purity and holiness, and is hence called the holy language ("Introduction to The %0a%3c Study of Ten Sefirot," item 120). %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is written in item sixteen, Heaven, earth, and all that inhabit them %0a%3c were created by MA, i.e., Malchut, as it is written, "MA = WHAT = HOW %0a%3c glorious is Your name in all the earth, which You have set above the Heavens!" %0a%3c Indeed, Heaven was created by the name (property) of MA (Malchut), whereas %0a%3c the Heaven that is mentioned alludes to Bina, called ML But all is explained by %0a%3c the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name Elokim is revealed in Heaven and earth, which were created by the %0a%3c power of MA, by attaching the letters ELEH from Ima-Bina with the help of MAN %0a%3c and good deeds of the lower ones. Therefore, the Light of GAR, i.e., Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c called Elokim, is consistent neither in Heaven (Bina) nor on earth (ZON). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 317 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Typically, only GE are present above the Parsa, in ZON of the world of %0a%3c Atzilut, whereas their AHP is below the Parsa, in the worlds BYA, for ZON %0a%3c themselves are unwilling to receive Ohr Hochma unless it is to be passed on to %0a%3c the Partzufim— the souls of the righteous— in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the lower ones, the righteous that exist spiritually in the worlds of BYA, %0a%3c raise MAN from below upwards, from their place in BYA to Malchut de Atzilut, %0a%3c MA turns into MI and the letters ELEH join with MI. Together, they create the %0a%3c word Elokim, which is the Light of Heaven and earth. However, if the lower ones %0a%3c corrupt their deeds by sinking into egoistic intentions, the Light disappears and %0a%3c leaves Sefirot K-H with the Light Ruach-Nefesh (called MI or MA), while the letters %0a%3c ELEH fall into the impure forces, for MI is GE and ELEH is AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the entire correction depends exclusively on attaching the letters %0a%3c ELEH to MI with the help of MAN. Hence, this correction is called the "holy %0a%3c language," like the scale pointer, which determines the balance between egoistic %0a%3c desires and altruistic intentions, i.e., the reception for the Creator's sake. This is %0a%3c why the scale pointer is set in the middle, and by means of such interaction of %0a%3c the properties of Malchut (the will to receive) and Bina (the will to bestow), one %0a%3c can achieve the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light is called "holy," as it passes the holy name Elokim to ZON, descends %0a%3c from Bina to ZON, and transfers the letters ELEH to the pure and holy side, to %0a%3c the scale of merit. This is why the Hebrew word for "scales" is Mawznaim (from %0a%3c the word Awzen), for the Light in AHP {Awzen-Hotem-Peh) is named according to %0a%3c its highest Light, the Light of Awzen of the Sefira Bina or Ohr Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - Galgalta - Forehead/Skull - Yechida %0a%3c Hochma - Eynaim - eyes - Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Awzen - ear - Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - Hotem - nose - Ruach \ AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - Peh - mouth - Nefesh ) %0a%3c %0a%3c And the language of translation called Targum is opposite to the holy %0a%3c language of Mawznaim (scales). It is so because when the lower ones do not raise %0a%3c MAN and do not harbor pure intentions, it is defined as an aspiration to use %0a%3c only the desires to receive, designated by the letters ELEH, and which do not %0a%3c aspire to unite with the desire (property) of bestowal (the letters MI-Bina). As a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 318 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c result, AHP of ZON, called MA, descend and Heaven and earth (ZON) return %0a%3c to the state of VAK. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a state is called the language of Targum. The Gematria of the word %0a%3c Tardema (sleep) matches that of the word Targum. In Hebrew, the word Targum is %0a%3c spelled with the same letters as the words Tered MA, which means "descending %0a%3c MA," for through this spiritually impure language, AHP = MA (designated %0a%3c by the words Tered MA) becomes revealed. This leads to the descent from the %0a%3c scale of merit to the scale of punishment. While this is happening, the state %0a%3c of GE is called "sleep." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all this refers only to ZON, to Heaven and earth created in MA, %0a%3c the desires of reception. This is because they have emerged as a result of a Zivug %0a%3c on Yesod, called MA. But the holy angels that emerged from the Zivug de Neshikin %0a%3c (kissing Zivug) of AVI, and which have only MI but no MA (only altruistic desires %0a%3c of bestowal, the property of IMA-Bina), permanently exist in the state of VAK %0a%3c without GAR, that is, without Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, their VAK is Ohr Hassadim of MI = Ima-Bina. Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim in Bina is as important as GAR, for it fills desires with just as perfect %0a%3c a sensation as does the GAR, to the point that they reject Ohr Hochma, just like %0a%3c Ima. And there is holiness in them; hence, GAR are called holy, as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two reasons why angels do not respond to the language of Targum, %0a%3c which adds MA to ZON and returns ZON to the state of VAK: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Even when ZON are in the state of GAR due to the influence of the %0a%3c holy language, angels do not receive GAR (Hochma) from it, as, just %0a%3c like Ima, they want only Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The addition of the Achoraim (AHP) does not apply to angels whatsoever; %0a%3c %0a%3c they lack the properties of MA. Hence, The Zohar says that THE HOLY %0a%3c ANGELS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEED for translation AND %0a%3c DO NOT LISTEN to it. They do not need it because they neither %0a%3c lose anything when it is present nor gain anything when it is absent, %0a%3c as they constitute the property of VAK and lack the property of MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THEY SHALL NOT ENVY MAN-this sentence refers primarily to %0a%3c the damnation of other gods, the forces that prevent man from revealing GAR, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. As a result, he loses the Light and the letters ELEH, for angels do %0a%3c not have the properties of GAR de Hochma either, but only GAR de Hassadim. %0a%3c Thus, they feel ashamed of their descent to such a low degree, and envy us for %0a%3c considering ourselves significant. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 319 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar says that in this case, even the holy angels are called "Creators," %0a%3c but they have not created Heaven and earth and are called "Creators-Elokim" %0a%3c (forces) because they come from Ima-Bina (called Elokim), thus existing in the %0a%3c general Elokim. But THEY HAVE NOT CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH, %0a%3c for they cannot uphold the existence of Heaven and earth in GAR de Hochma. %0a%3c However, Heaven and earth (the correction of the world to its ultimate merging %0a%3c with the Creator) cannot exist unless man settles there (man must consist of %0a%3c egoistic and altruistic desires) and sows and reaps (corrects his egoistic desires by %0a%3c uniting with the properties of Bind). This existence is possible only in the Light %0a%3c of GAR de Hochma (the reception of Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake). Hence, %0a%3c angels do not create Heaven and earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 153. He asks: earth is called Arka, when it should read, Ar'a. He answers: %0a%3c because Arka is one of the seven lands below, where the sons of Cain's sons %0a%3c reside. Indeed, after being banished from the face of the earth, they descended %0a%3c there and fathered generations; wisdom became so lost that all understanding %0a%3c was lost, and this is a double land, consisting of darkness and Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the seven Sefirot (the six Sefirot of ZA and Malchut) contain the %0a%3c properties of the other six. Thus, each one of them contains the seven Sefirot %0a%3c HGT NHYM. In other words, Malchut, too, has seven Sefirot, and the lower %0a%3c world contains seven lands, as well, called Eretz, Adama, Arka, Gia, Neshia, %0a%3c Tzia and level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our land is called Tevel and is the highest of the seven lands. Arka is the %0a%3c third of the seven lands. The souls of Cain and Abel descend from the word %0a%3c Elokim, but due to the impurity that Chava (Eve), Adam's wife, received from %0a%3c the serpent, the soul of Cain emerged first from the letters ELEH, followed %0a%3c by the soul of Abel, which emerged from the letters ML These two Partzufim %0a%3c were meant to unite and incorporate their properties in one another, which %0a%3c would make the name Elokim shine in both of them, as when MI is permanently %0a%3c present in ELEH. However, the impure force that emerged together with Cain's %0a%3c soul incited him against his brother (MI of the word Elokim) to the point that he %0a%3c rose against Abel (MI in Elokim) and slew him. This is because the disappearance %0a%3c of the property of MI-Bina from ELEH is tantamount to murder. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without the support of the properties of MI, ELEH (Cain's own property) %0a%3c fell into the impure forces: from the spiritual level of the holy land to the impure %0a%3c place (of egoistic desires). And he lost his descendants (Partzufim filled with Light) %0a%3c because of the rule of the impure forces (the disappearance of the screen). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 320 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the holy language within him was substituted for translation, for he %0a%3c had lost the wisdom (Ohr Hochma). After all, the impure forces lack wisdom, as %0a%3c they have only the Light of HB without Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The slaying of Abel, i.e., the exit of Light from this Partzuf (item 152), occurs %0a%3c because MI is formed in ZON exclusively by the power of MAN (raised by the pure %0a%3c thoughts of the righteous in the worlds of BYA). Then appear the letters ELEH, %0a%3c and the word Elokim becomes as complete in ZON as it is in AVI. Malchut ends just %0a%3c like ZA, like Ima, due to the replacing of the letter Hey with Yod (item 17). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the letter He;y does not disappear from MA forever. Rather, it %0a%3c simply enters the inner part of Malchut and hides there (the will to receive %0a%3c receives its fulfillment from altruistic actions, from Ohr Hassadim. Hence, its %0a%3c egoistic aspirations are temporarily unfelt, as they are concealed in Ohr Hassadim). %0a%3c Meanwhile, the letter Yod is revealed in ML %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the Creator's holy name Elokim is also found in ZON, in Heaven %0a%3c and earth. However, Cain raised MAN not in holiness and purity, but wished %0a%3c to use the letters ELEH— which relate to him— for his own pleasure. This is %0a%3c described as, AND CAIN ROSE UP AGAINST ABEL, HIS BROTHER, for he %0a%3c put himself above his brother, to rule over MI (Abel). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, AHP of Nukva (the hitherto concealed letter Hey of MA) were %0a%3c immediately revealed, and the word MI disappeared from Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c Abel's soul, which stems from MI of NuLua (MI fill the Partzuf with Light and are %0a%3c considered its soul) ascends and disappears as well, as is described by the words, %0a%3c AND SLEW HIM, for the Light's exit from the Partzuf is referred to as death. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar describes this process in the following way: The %0a%3c serpent's impure force was within Cain (Beresheet, 2:4); hence, he wished to %0a%3c strengthen the letters ELEH, annul MI, and govern them. That is why he revealed %0a%3c AHP of Nukva (MA) and MI disappeared from Nukva, whereupon Abel's soul, %0a%3c which descends from MI, disappeared as well (AND SLEW HIM). %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Cain himself (ELEH) fell under the rule of the impure forces, called %0a%3c Arka or Eretz Nod, as it is written in the Torah: "And he settled in the land of %0a%3c Nod" (Beresheet, 4:16). %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar calls it a double land, one that contains both Light and darkness. %0a%3c This is because Light and darkness mix and act (rule) together, as there are two %0a%3c rulers in that land, who divide the power equally between them. One rules over %0a%3c darkness, the other over Light. Hence, in this state one is unable to separate %0a%3c Light from darkness, and only help from Above, the descending Light of reason, %0a%3c enables one to tell between the true Ruler and the lord of darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 321 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154. And there are two rulers there— one rules over darkness and one over %0a%3c Light, and they become hostile to each other. When Cain descended there, %0a%3c they joined together and became complete. And they all saw that they were %0a%3c Cain's descendants. Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, except %0a%3c for when the ruler of Light defeats the other, the ruler of darkness. Hence, %0a%3c they enter Light and darkness, and become as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c We need to review item 14, which expounds on the creation of the holy %0a%3c name Elokim. First, the letters ELEH ascend and join MI to form a simple %0a%3c word, since Ohr Hassadim is still insufficient, whereas holiness (Ohr Hochma) %0a%3c cannot enter the Kli (desire) without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. Hence, it %0a%3c is concealed in the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why a Zivug takes place in MI— to receive Ohr Hassadim, which clothes %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, thereby correcting the name Elokim: Ml BARAH ELEH— BARAH %0a%3c is the source of Ohr Hassadim, which clothes Ohr Hochma, thus connecting MI %0a%3c to ELEH, which brings correction to the name Elokim. MI-Bina consists of GAR %0a%3c (AVI with the property of pure altruism), who never receive Ohr Hochma, and %0a%3c ZAT (YESHSUT), who do receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as the letters ELEH begin to ascend to MI, they first rise to ZAT %0a%3c de Ml (YESHSUT), who receive Ohr Hochma, but are currently concealed in the %0a%3c name Elokim. Then transpires the second Zivug on GAR de Ml, AVI, altruistic %0a%3c desires, which provide ELEH with Ohr Hassadim, thus bringing correction to %0a%3c the name Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI - GARdeBina - Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT - ZATdeBina - Ohr Hochma %0a%3c ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c Since ELEH lacks Ohr Hassadim, those deprived from Ohr Hochma are called %0a%3c Partzuf Cain. Not only did Cain fail to raise MAN to receive MI with Hassadim, %0a%3c he also wished to receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, thereby destroying the Partzuf %0a%3c named Abel, for the egoistic desires of AHP de Malchut of Atzilut were exposed. %0a%3c The Light disappeared from Partzuf Abel, signifying its death, whereas Cain %0a%3c himself fell into the impure forces— ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The place of these impure forces is called Arka. Also, two rulers exist there, %0a%3c emerging from the impure ELEH: when AHP de MA in Malchut is concealed, %0a%3c while AHP de Ml are revealed, they can pass the Light from the perfect, %0a%3c pure, and holy name Elokim to the souls. Ohr Hochma of ELEH (received by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 322 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT) then clothes in Hassadim (received from AVI), and the holy name %0a%3c Elokim becomes revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the impure forces cling only to the AHP of the pure forces %0a%3c (to MA), the letters ELEH within them exist in two incomplete states: (i) when %0a%3c no Hassadim are present at all; (ii) when Ohr Hochma in ELEH cannot clothe in %0a%3c Hassadim due to the lack of Hassadim de Ml; hence, ELEH are kept in darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the male part of the impure ELEH, as these Kelim are intended for %0a%3c Ohr Hochma. However, they have no Hochma due to the lack of Hassadim de ML %0a%3c Hence, they are kept in darkness, devoid of both Hochma and Hassadim. Yet, %0a%3c these are great Kelim, for if they had been able to receive Ohr Hassadim, they %0a%3c would have been able to receive Ohr Hochma within it, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c The female part of the impure ELEH stems from AHP de MA of the holy %0a%3c Nukva, the Kli for Ohr Hassadim. However, the impure Nukva is considerably %0a%3c injured, as she is the basis for everyone's remoteness from the Creator, as she %0a%3c impersonates the holy Malchut. Depending on the extent of her corruption, %0a%3c she has a multitude of impure names. Yet, she still retains a tiny Light (Ner %0a%3c Dakik), since her Kelim stem from AHP de MA, the roots of which are Kelim %0a%3c of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c These male and female parts of the impure ELEH are ZA and Malchut of %0a%3c the impure forces, the two rulers in Arka. The male part rules over darkness %0a%3c and the female part rules over the Light that is there. They complain against %0a%3c each another, since they are opposite. The male part complains because it is the %0a%3c Kelim of the letters ELEH, which are empty of Ohr Hochma; it hates the forces %0a%3c of remoteness from the Creator and forgery, existing within the Kelim of the %0a%3c female part of the impure forces, and prefers to remain in its darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva of the impure forces, however, who has a small Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c does not aspire for Ohr Hochma, let alone for the darkness in which her male %0a%3c part abides. Therefore, she complains about the male part and distances from %0a%3c it. As The Zohar says, two rulers govern there: one (the male part) over darkness, %0a%3c and the other (the female part) over Light, and they are hostile towards each %0a%3c other, for the male part rules over darkness and the female rules over Light. %0a%3c Hence, they hate, slander, and complain against each other. And since they are %0a%3c thereby distanced from one another, they cannot expand their dominance and %0a%3c are incapable of causing any harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Cain had sinned and dropped the pure letters of ELEH of %0a%3c his soul into the impure forces of Arka, his ELEH, which are concealed from %0a%3c Hassadim, clothed in the tiny Light present in the impure forces. This revives %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 323 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the small Kelim de Hochma in Cain's ELEH, for the Light of the impure forces %0a%3c bestows life upon them, just like the pure Light of Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the male part of ELEH of the impure forces, too, made a Zivug %0a%3c with this Nukva, who clothed Cain's ELEH, since he has these Kelim, as well. %0a%3c With the help of this Zivug, Cain fathered his descendants, the sparks of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma that remain in the letters ELEH, which are not mixed with the male %0a%3c impure Kelim of ELEH that clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that when Cain descended there, everything %0a%3c merged and became complete, for the sparks of Ohr Hochma that remained %0a%3c in Cain's ELEH were clothed in the Light of Nukva of the impure forces. %0a%3c Consequently, her male impure force wished to enjoy the sparks of Ohr Hochma %0a%3c that are in Cain's ELEH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, they made a Zivug, i.e., spread and completed one another, and %0a%3c everyone saw that they were the descendants of Cain, that this Zivug produced %0a%3c the descendants, the clothing of the sparks of Ohr Hochma in Cain's impure %0a%3c ELEH. Thus, the sparks of Ohr Hochma of Cain's soul were revealed, and %0a%3c everyone saw that they were Cain's descendants, born of a vile Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, their two heads are like two serpents, for they were born from %0a%3c a union of the male and female parts of the impure ELEH, which are initially %0a%3c opposite to one another. Therefore, Cain's descendants have two heads, from %0a%3c the two impure forces: one craves the darkness of the desires to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and the other craves the Light within the impure desires of the impure %0a%3c Nukva. And the two serpent heads correspond to the two animals that belong to %0a%3c the system of the pure forces: the bull and the eagle. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the two heads exist only when the male part is dominant, when %0a%3c darkness rules. Indeed, by clothing in the Light of ~Nukva in order to enjoy the %0a%3c small sparks of Ohr Hochma, the male part also supports (against its will) the %0a%3c dominance of its Nukva, for it wants her Light. As a result, their descendants %0a%3c have two heads: the first pulls in one direction and the second in another. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva of the impure forces does not need their male part whatsoever, as %0a%3c her male part exists in darkness and cannot give her anything. Therefore, Nukva %0a%3c dominates and prevails in her impurity, leaving nothing of the properties of the %0a%3c male part. Consequently, Cain's two-headed descendants become one-headed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that the ruler of Light defeats the lord of darkness. When %0a%3c the impure Nukva, which has the Light, dominates, she defeats the male impure %0a%3c part, as well as the other male ruler. She defeats the male part, fully subduing it %0a%3c to her rule, and they include themselves in her Light and darkness, and become %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 324 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c as one. Consequently, the rule of the male part (darkness) is included under the %0a%3c rule of the female part (Light), and the two heads become one. %0a%3c %0a%3c 155. For these are the two rulers, called Afrira and Kastimon, who resemble %0a%3c holy angels with six wings. One has the image of a bull, and the other of an %0a%3c eagle. And when they unite, they create an image of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The male impure force is called Kastimon (from the word Kosti, devastation), %0a%3c for it is darkness and is unfit for man's life. And the impure Nukva, the female %0a%3c part, is called Afrira (from the word Afar, dust), and is unfit for sowing. She is %0a%3c called so in order to show that although she contains Light, she is insufficient %0a%3c for sowing the seed and producing harvest to feed human beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also says that she resembles holy angels with six wings, for the six %0a%3c wings of the holy angels correspond to the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH. In %0a%3c contrast, there are only four wings in the impure forces, corresponding to the %0a%3c name ADM, indicating the height of the impure forces with regard to the holy %0a%3c angels, opposite them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Light is called "wine," bringing joy to the Creator and to human %0a%3c beings. However, wine residue contains Sigim or wine yeast. And from this waste %0a%3c emerges the foremost wrecker of the world, for he is still connected to purity %0a%3c (to yeast) and has the image of a man. However, as he descends to bring people %0a%3c harm, he assumes the image of a bull. This is why a bull is the first of the four %0a%3c main types of wrecker. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, The Zohar tells us that Kastimon is a wrecker in the image of a bull, %0a%3c thus indicating that it is the basis of all wreckers that are called "the impure bull." %0a%3c It is the Sigim of the Supernal Ohr Hochma of the holy name Elokim, the impure %0a%3c ELEH that correspond to the pure ELEH of the name Elokim. For Sigim and %0a%3c yeast stand below it, but since it is still connected to purity, it has the image of %0a%3c man, for Ohr Hochma of the name Elokim is T^elem (image and likeness) of man, %0a%3c of which it is said: "Be T^elem Elokim— created man in image and likeness." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, when separated from purity (altruism) through deterioration of its %0a%3c desires and, consequently, of its properties, it descends to its place (befitting %0a%3c these properties) in Arka, and assumes the image (properties) of a bull. And its %0a%3c Nukva assumes (in Arka) the form (properties) of an eagle, in congruence with %0a%3c her goal and action of Linshor (to fall out)— to bring about the fall of human %0a%3c souls under her power. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the word Nesher (vulture) is derived from the word Neshira (fall), just %0a%3c as leaves fall from a tree, for the role of the impure Nukva is to seek people out %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 325 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and bring them to a state of night and darkness, to the destruction of the holy %0a%3c covenant, as a result of which people's souls depart from them (item 131). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us: "And when they unite, they form the image of %0a%3c man," i.e., if they return and unite with purity, existing as wine yeast, they return %0a%3c and assume once more the image of man, just as before they descended to Arka %0a%3c and became wreckers. %0a%3c %0a%3c 156. When they are covered with darkness, they turn into a serpent with two %0a%3c heads, and move like a serpent. They soar in the void and bathe in the Great %0a%3c Sea, and when they approach the chains of Aza and Azael, they rile and rouse %0a%3c them and leap into the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator %0a%3c wishes to bring justice upon them. %0a%3c %0a%3c I suggest that the reader will try to comment on The Zohar on his own, %0a%3c without any help, and then compare his thoughts with those stated below. This %0a%3c way, we might understand what Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag has done for us with his %0a%3c commentary. Prior to the appearance of his commentaries on the books of the %0a%3c ARI and The Zohar, there was no way for us to understand Kabbalah correctly, %0a%3c only a handful of people in each generation could climb the spiritua %0a%3c ler on their own. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now, however, I assure the reader that simply by constantly reading eve %0a%3c ks, which retell the compositions of the great Kabbalists, Rabbi Ashlag %0a%3c his elder son and my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Ashlag, anyone can attain ascension %0a%3c to the Creator. I think that those who have already read previous books realize %0a%3c that this is truly possible! %0a%3c %0a%3c As The Zohar already mentioned in item 154, when the impure Nukva %0a%3c dominates man through her Light, the two heads become as one. However, in %0a%3c the darkness, when the male part, called Kastimon, dominates, they turn into %0a%3c a serpent with two heads, for the male part is unable to annul the power of the %0a%3c female part, as it needs to be clothed in her Light. Hence, the serpent has two %0a%3c heads. And they move like a serpent— aiming to bring harm (the property of the %0a%3c serpent), to tempt Chava to dine on the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c By the power of the Rosh of the impure Nukva they soar in the void, which %0a%3c contains the root of the impure force, called "void" or the greatest fall, as it %0a%3c is written: "They ascended up to Heaven, they descended down to the abyss" %0a%3c (Tehilim, 107:26). By the power of the impure male part, they bathe in the Great %0a%3c Sea, in Ohr Hochma of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 326 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Arka is called the Land of Nod, as it constantly sways from the %0a%3c rule of the two heads: those that reside there keep alternating between ascending %0a%3c up to the Great Sea and descending down into the void. %0a%3c %0a%3c The angels Aza and Azael are very exalted angels. Indeed, even after they %0a%3c had fallen from Heaven into our world, into the mountains of darkness, linked %0a%3c by a metal chain, so great was their power that with their help Bil'am (Balaam) %0a%3c attained the degree of prophecy, of which it is written: "Sees the Creator's %0a%3c presence" (Bamidbar, 24:4). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is described as "falls and opens his eyes," for Aza is referred to as %0a%3c "falling" because of his fall from Heaven to earth. And Azael is called "he who %0a%3c opens his eyes" with regard to Aza, at whose face the Creator throws darkness. %0a%3c And with regard to Bil'am's prophetic degree, our sages have said the following: %0a%3c "There has not been a prophet in Israel like Moshe, not in Israel, but there was %0a%3c one among the nations of the world, and his name was Bil'am" (Bamidbar-Raba, %0a%3c 14)— so great was his prophetic degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the reason for their downfall from Heaven to earth lies in their %0a%3c complaints against man at the moment of his making. Yet, there were many %0a%3c angels complaining and objecting, so why did the Creator cast down only these %0a%3c two? The answer to this question can be found in items 416-425 of the chapter %0a%3c "Balak" in The Zohar. Briefly, it says that when the desire to create Adam (or %0a%3c man, since the Hebrew word for man is Adam) appeared in the Creator, He %0a%3c summoned the Supernal angels, seated them before Him, and told them of His %0a%3c desire to create man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The angels replied: "What is man, that You are mindful of him?" (Tehilim, %0a%3c 8:5), meaning what are the properties of this man that You so wish to create? He %0a%3c replied to them: "This man will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass %0a%3c yours, for the human soul includes all the angels and Supernal Degrees, just as %0a%3c his body includes all the creatures of this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, at the moment of creation of man's soul, the Creator summoned %0a%3c all the Supernal angels, so they would pass all of their properties and forces %0a%3c to man's soul. It is therefore written: "Let us make man in our image, in our %0a%3c likeness," meaning that man's "image and likeness" includes all of the properties %0a%3c of all the angels. %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "image and likeness" are written in quotation marks, since the %0a%3c words Tzelem and Demut (image and likeness) are not mere words that simply %0a%3c describe likeness. Rather, they constitute very meaningful spiritual notions. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 327 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But the angels' question should be interpreted as follows: "What kind of a %0a%3c creature is this man and what is his nature? How shall we benefit from passing %0a%3c (including) our properties in him?" The Creator replied to this: "This man %0a%3c will be similar to Me and his wisdom will surpass yours." In other words, the %0a%3c Creator thus promised them that man will embrace all of their qualities (the %0a%3c properties of Tzelem), and that he will be wiser than them. However, because of %0a%3c their connection to him, they will also benefit from his great attainments and %0a%3c acquire everything that they presently lack. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because the human soul includes all the spiritual degrees and all the %0a%3c utmost properties of all the angels. And just as his body includes all the materials %0a%3c and creatures of our world with all of their properties, so was the Creator's wish %0a%3c that his soul would absorb the whole of creation within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in the Torah: "Yaakov and Israel shall be told of the Creator's %0a%3c works (Bamidbar, 23:23)." The sages have said that in the future the angels will %0a%3c ask Israel for things that they do not know themselves, for Israel's attainments %0a%3c will be beyond that of the angels. Hence, all the angels took part in the creation %0a%3c of man and integrated all their properties within him. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, once man was created and sinned, thus becoming guilty before the %0a%3c Creator, the angels Aza and Azael appeared before the Creator with accusations %0a%3c "that man, whom You have created, has sinned before You." For these words, %0a%3c the Creator cast them down from their exalted and holy degree, and thus, they %0a%3c began to deceive human beings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the angels, only these two, Aza and Azael, came before the Creator %0a%3c to complain about Adam's sins, for only they knew that man shall return to %0a%3c the Creator. However, Aza and Azael also knew that the harm brought to them %0a%3c by man's sin will not be corrected by this return. Moreover, they would prefer %0a%3c man to not return in his desires to the Creator at all. This is why they were the %0a%3c only ones that complained about Adam's sin, because from their perspective, %0a%3c this sin is incorrigible. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the breaking of the vessels and Adam's sin constitute the %0a%3c same breaking, disappearance of the screen (anti-egoistic willpower or intention %0a%3c to act for the Creator's sake). The difference is that the breaking of the vessels %0a%3c signifies the breaking of the screen in the Partzuf called "world," while Adam's %0a%3c sin is the breaking, disappearance of the screen in the Partzuf called "soul." %0a%3c The difference between these two Partzufim is that the Partzuf called "world" is %0a%3c external with regard to the inner Partzuf called "soul." The soul exists within the %0a%3c world and is sustained by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 328 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking has its causes and consequences. It is necessary for mixing %0a%3c all the properties of Bina and Malchut, and must transpire both in the spiritual %0a%3c world and within the soul, to impart the properties of Bina to Malchut, and thus %0a%3c enable her to correct herself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking of the world of Nekudim led to the breaking of the eight %0a%3c Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-2/3 of Tifferet and 1/3 of Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, %0a%3c four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M in each one that in turn consists of ten Sefirot, in all: %0a%3c 8 x 4 x 10 = 320 (SHACH) parts. As a result of the mixing of all the parts, %0a%3c each part in turn consists of 320 parts. All of these 320 parts, called Nitzotzin %0a%3c (sparks), acquired the egoistic will to enjoy by receiving the Creator's Light, %0a%3c which signifies their descent into the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c /ision the reception of lower properties as a descent, the reception of %0a%3c spiritual properties as an ascent, the attainment of equivalence of forr %0a%3c union, and the emergence of a new property as separation. The appearance %0a%3c of egoistic desires in a spiritual object is considered a descent into the impure %0a%3c forces, although these forces exist within us (and not vice versa), and simply %0a%3c )me more apparent. There is nothing surrounding us, for everything %0a%3c the worlds and desires, both pure and impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c By studying Kabbalah we attract the emanation of the Light that surr %0a%3c il (see "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," item 155), %0a%3c ;s within us a desire for correction. Then, as we attain the degrees o %0a%3c spiritual worlds, we begin to feel the spiritual Light that corresponds to each %0a%3c degree, through which we begin to discern egoistic and altruistic parts in each %0a%3c of our properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c By comparisons to the Light, we perceive our egoistic parts as evil, and to %0a%3c the extent that we sense it, we distance ourselves from it and refuse to use these %0a%3c desires. Conversely, we perceive our altruistic desires as good for us, but, having %0a%3c strength to use them, we submit a request, receive the necessary strength, ar %0a%3c ie Light for the Creator's sake, thereby ascending to a higher deg %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The return (Teshuva— repentance) means that by raising MAN (request for %0a%3c correction), we elevate some of the 320 corrupt parts from the impure forces, %0a%3c into which they fell, back to the world of Atzilut, where they existed prior to %0a%3c Adam's sin. However, we are powerless to sort out and correct, i.e., to elevate the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 329 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c thirty-two parts of Malchut herself, which exist in the eight Sefirot of this Partzuf %0a%3c (world), for their level of corruption is beyond our ability to repair them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, out of the 320 (SHACH = Shin + Chet = 300 + 20) parts, we can, %0a%3c that is, we are entitled to and must sort out and correct only 320 - 32 = 288 %0a%3c parts (RAPACH = 288) by our return to the Creator, i.e., 9 x 32, where nine %0a%3c designates the first nine Sefirot in each Sefira that we are allowed to correct. %0a%3c Yet, we are unable to correct Malchut of each Sefira, for this requires a Light %0a%3c of a special power. We will receive this Light from the Creator only after the %0a%3c correction of all the other 288 parts, that is, at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c These thirty-two parts of Malchut, which are impossible and thus prohibited %0a%3c to correct, are called Lev HaEven (Lamed-Bet Even— thirty-two stones). As I've %0a%3c repeatedly mentioned, there is no such notion as "prohibition" in Kabbalah; %0a%3c this word is used when it is necessary to point out the futility of trying despite %0a%3c one's weakness and limitation. "Prohibited" means impossible, beyond one's %0a%3c power. Moreover, it is not the Creator's prohibition; rather, as a result of one's %0a%3c personal faith and experience, one should admit that "prohibited" alludes to %0a%3c whatever is still beyond one's power to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, GAR de AVI are concealed, and their Light does not shine. %0a%3c After all, for all of its ten Sefirot to shine, a Zivug needs to be made on Malchut %0a%3c herself, for Lev HaEven, the thirty-two uncorrected parts of Malchut herself are a %0a%3c supplement to their ten Sefirot. And as long as these Kelim are missing, a complete %0a%3c Zivug is impossible. However, when the complete analysis and correction of the %0a%3c 288 (RAPACH = Reish + Peh + Chet = 200 + 80 + 8 = 288) Nitzotzin is completed, %0a%3c Lev HaEven will be corrected by itself, and no effort or corrections shall be %0a%3c required on our part. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the prophet says: "A new heart also shall I give you, and a new spirit shall %0a%3c I put within you; and I shall take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and %0a%3c I shall give you a heart of flesh" (Yechezkel, 36:26). Then AVI will receive their %0a%3c Light. However, this will occur at the end of correction, and before the end of %0a%3c correction, AHP of AVI will not be able to receive correction by means of our %0a%3c return, for we will be able to correct all of our egoistic desires, except for our very %0a%3c essence, Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c These angels— Aza and Azael— are the real AHP de AVI that were destroyed %0a%3c during the breaking of the vessels, and were nearly restored before the sin of %0a%3c Adam. However, Adam's sin destroyed them once more, this time until the very %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 330 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, both angels were complaining to the Creator about their Light, %0a%3c which has disappeared because of Adam, for they saw that there was no hope %0a%3c that Adam would correct them through his return to the Creator. Moreover, %0a%3c they saw that by his return, Adam had lowered their degree even more, for now %0a%3c the entire correction and return was limited to only 288 parts, without any %0a%3c participation or even mentioning of the thirty-two forbidden parts, Lev HaEven, %0a%3c which refer to the correction of AVI, whose Light is the Light of these angels, %0a%3c just as the Kelim of the true AHP de AVI are their Kelim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each raising of MAN designates cutting off, separation of impurity— Lev %0a%3c HaEven— from the food, RAPACH = 288 Nitzotzin, the parts that can be corrected. %0a%3c It follows that by preventing Aza and Azael from participating in the correction %0a%3c of Lev HaEven, we lower them even more. This is why the two angels complained %0a%3c to the Creator and tried to impede Adam from returning. After all, his return %0a%3c lowers them even further, for the thirty-two parts refer to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when the Creator saw that their complaints threatened to weaken %0a%3c man's strength to return to Him, He told them that Adam's sin did not spoil %0a%3c anything for them. For although there is greatness and holiness in them while %0a%3c they are in Heaven and no impure forces can cling to them, still this perfection %0a%3c is incomplete, as they cannot exist in our world, in a place of impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator told them: "Hence, you have lost nothing as a result of Adam's %0a%3c sin, for you are no better than him anyway, as your degree is merely the result %0a%3c of the place of your residence." And since the Creator's words constitute His %0a%3c actions, they fell instantly from Heaven to earth (into egoism, of course, not to %0a%3c the physical earth!). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since they came (spiritually descended) to the corporeal life (as %0a%3c Kabbalah defines it), they began to sort through and analyze the thirty-two parts %0a%3c of complete egoism, called the "daughters of men," of which the Torah says: %0a%3c "And the sons of great (angels) saw the daughters of men (egoistic Nukva), that %0a%3c they were fair (they saw in her an opportunity for egoistic reception of pleasure), %0a%3c and they took them as wives (used their egoistic desires), whomsoever they chose %0a%3c (they themselves chose precisely this low state)" (Beresheet, 6:2). For they did not %0a%3c want to separate the impurity of the thirty-two egoistic parts and prefer only %0a%3c 288, but took everything they wished, including Lev HaEven. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, they also transgressed with Nukva Lilit (Lilith) the sinner, and wished %0a%3c to draw the entire world toward sin, to fling it into the last stage of egoism, for %0a%3c they did not wish man to return, as it completely contradicts their root. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 331 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c What did the Creator do? He put them in iron chains! For the Creator saw %0a%3c that if they had the power to return to Heaven after the sin, all the people would %0a%3c fail in their attempts to aspire to the Creator in their desires, as the dominance %0a%3c of these egoistic angels (forces) in man would be too great. (Rashi— the great %0a%3c eleventh century Kabbalist and Biblical commentator— says that the entire Torah %0a%3c speaks in the words of man. Hence, everything is described in notions of time %0a%3c and sequence of events. Similarly, the Creator seemingly creates and only then %0a%3c sees the results of his work). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, although their root is quite high, the Creator gave the root of the %0a%3c impure forces His permission to act (here we see that the Creator governs all the %0a%3c forces in creation). This root is called Barzel (iron), as it is written: "There was %0a%3c neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in %0a%3c building" (Melachim, 1, 6:7), for iron is an impure force. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since this impure force clang to the two angels and bound them, %0a%3c as if with iron chains, by the desires that it dictates to them, such a state is %0a%3c characterized as being in the mountains of darkness, from which they can no %0a%3c longer ascend until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when they approach the chain of Aza and Azael, rile and rouse them, %0a%3c it designates the awakening of the fourth part of the will to receive, Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut, the greatest desire to receive, called "wrath and rage." And they %0a%3c leap over the mountains of darkness, thinking that the Creator wishes to bring %0a%3c justice upon them, for being bound by iron chains, they could not ascend to %0a%3c their roots and receive Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, this action is considered leaping, an attempt to ascend, followed %0a%3c by a fall, as a result of which they descend even deeper into the mountains of %0a%3c darkness. And they think that because of their leaps (attempts to receive the %0a%3c Light from their root), the Creator is becoming increasingly stricter with them; %0a%3c thus, they decide to stop leaping. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, even though they cannot give anything, as their attempts to reach up %0a%3c are mere leaps and falls, it is nonetheless enough for the two rulers to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma from them, as this gives them the strength to swim in the sea of Hochma %0a%3c of the impure force, whereas before they had only the strength to bathe in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that there is no action in this exalted impure force, %0a%3c and everything is limited only in thoughts and desires, for such is the essence %0a%3c of the impure forces (desires) that separate us from the Creator— before the level %0a%3c of an action is achieved, purity disappears from it. Therefore, the impure forces %0a%3c will never reach the level of an action. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 332 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the work for the impure forces is called Avoda Zara (alien work or %0a%3c idol worshipping), as it is alien to spiritual work "for the Creator's sake," and %0a%3c is performed according to the instruction and desires that the impure forces %0a%3c insert into man's thoughts. In this alien work for an alien master, the Creator %0a%3c punishes even for mere thoughts and desires, as the prophet said: "That %0a%3c the house of Israel may understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). %0a%3c And the sages have said that man is accused and punished even for thoughts, %0a%3c desires, and doubts in the alien work that transpires in his heart in exactly the same %0a%3c measure as for a completed action. Hence, the leaps of Aza and Azael are sufficient %0a%3c in their desire to receive Hochma, although in reality they received nothing. %0a%3c %0a%3c 157. And these two Creator-appointed rulers swim in the Great Sea, fly up %0a%3c from there, and at night go to Naamah, the mother of witches, for whom the %0a%3c first people fell (Beresheet, 6:1-4). And they wish to approach her, but she %0a%3c leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot and assumes several different forms, so that people may %0a%3c be deceived and enticed by her. %0a%3c %0a%3c After receiving power from Aza and Azael, they can now make a Zivug with %0a%3c Naamah, as the first angels Aza and Azael erred. From that Zivug with Aza and %0a%3c Azael, Naamah gave birth to all the spirits and witches of the world. The Torah %0a%3c calls Aza and Azael the "sons of Gods" or the "sons of the great" (Beresheet, 6:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how could such exalted angels stoop to such depraved actions with %0a%3c Naamah, and why did she give birth to spirits and witches, and not to people? %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the Upper World (AVI) was created by the letter Yod, by the %0a%3c male part, which have nothing of the fourth part of Malchut, called Malchut de %0a%3c Malchut. However, ZON (the lower world) was created by the letter Hey, which %0a%3c includes Malchut de Malchut. AVI aspire only to Ohr Hassadim, to altruistic %0a%3c actions (bestowal), for Bina emerged as such in the four stages of Malchut s birth, %0a%3c even before the appearance of the first Kli (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, ZON need Ohr Hochma, since ZA was created as such in the %0a%3c four stages of Malchut 's birth. Also, ZA wishes to receive Ohr Hochma within Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, which he already has. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zivug of AVI, called the "Upper World," begets angels who desire Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, just like AVI, from whom they were born. Human souls are born from %0a%3c the Zivug of ZON, called the "lower world," and they, like ZON, from whom %0a%3c they were born, desire only Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moment the common soul of all the creatures (Adam) was born from %0a%3c ZON de Atzilut, ZON existed at the level of the Upper World (AVI) and clothed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 333 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it. Like AVI, they, too, ended in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH. And %0a%3c the letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH was concealed in their posterior side, %0a%3c Achoraim or AHP. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Adam's level was quite high because ZON was in the Upper World %0a%3c and ended in the letter Yod. The level of ZON was that of the angels that were %0a%3c born from AVI; therewith, ZON received Ohr Hochma according to their desires, %0a%3c as ZON are meant to. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, ZON contain the name Elokim, Supernal Hochma, the perfection %0a%3c of the Upper World. This is because the ban of the first restriction to not receive %0a%3c Ohr Hochma does not apply to the letter Yod. Cain and Abel were born from this %0a%3c state: Cain was born from ELEH and Abel from MI. Malchut herself (the last %0a%3c letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH) was concealed in them both, and only the %0a%3c letter Yod was revealed; hence, they contained Supernal Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, on the whole, Hochma is received in Kelim ELEH, ZAT de Bina, %0a%3c by Cain's soul. This property of Cain is concealed in MI, as the last Hey is %0a%3c concealed inside Yod, and Cain wanted to make a Zivug with it, to receive Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in Malchut de Malchut, concealed in Abel's soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is by this that he slew Abel, for after the last Hey was revealed, the ban %0a%3c of the first restriction to receive Ohr Hochma in it was revealed. Hence, the %0a%3c Creator's name Elokim disappeared from them both: MI, since it refers to GAR, %0a%3c ascended and disappeared (signifying Abel's slaying), and Cain's ELEH, since it %0a%3c refers to ZAT, fell into the impure forces, called Arka. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although it fell into the impure forces, sparks of Ohr Hochma still %0a%3c remain in these Kelim (desires), as it is written that his daughters did not suffer %0a%3c from it greatly, and the sparks of Bina still remained in them. From this we can %0a%3c understand that Naamah, one of Cain's daughters, was the most beautiful of all %0a%3c the women in the world, for the sin transpired mainly in Cain's male part, and %0a%3c not in his female part, as is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 74:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the Creator cast Aza and Azael into this world (created by %0a%3c the letter Hey), and they've seen Naamah, a new hitherto non-existent desire %0a%3c appeared within them— the desire to receive Ohr Hochma, for in their essence %0a%3c they desire only Ohr Hassadim, and only the image of Naamah bore a new desire %0a%3c for Ohr Hochma within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since there is no Hey (the last Hey, on which there is a ban to receive %0a%3c Ohr Hochma) in their essence and in that of Naamah (the last revealed one, for %0a%3c it originates from Cain's ELEH), they erred in her, thinking that she is able to %0a%3c receive Ohr Hochma, and made a Zivug with her. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 334 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Their error was twofold: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Despite the fact that they do not have the last Hey from birth, since %0a%3c the place determines, and they exist in this world, the last Hey already %0a%3c governs them, and they are forbidden to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. They thought that the last Hey was absent in Naamah's structure, %0a%3c when in fact, it was concealed. Hence, spirits and witches were born %0a%3c from their Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we can understand what is written in the Talmud (Hagiga, 16:1), %0a%3c that witches are half-angels half-people, for with regard to their fathers, Aza and %0a%3c Azael, they are angels, whereas with regard to Naamah, they are like people. But %0a%3c she could not give birth to people, for the seed within her came from angels, %0a%3c and not from people. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the harm that they cause lies in the fact that they were born %0a%3c from depravity, the greatest possible distance from the Creator. Hence, their %0a%3c impurity accompanies them and brings harm wherever it possibly can. Therefore, %0a%3c The Zohar says that at night they come to Naamah, the mother of witches, for %0a%3c whom the first people fell (see Beresheet, 6:1-4). %0a%3c %0a%3c Indeed, after they received strength from these angels, who were the first to %0a%3c engage in depravity with Naamah, they could continue to engage in depravity %0a%3c with her. The Zohar indicates that this is precisely why they come at night, for the %0a%3c power of Hochma of the impure forces rules only in the darkness of night, the %0a%3c time of judgment and restrictions, and also as the consequence of roots, namely %0a%3c Aza and Azael, who reside in the mountains of darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after engaging in depravity with them, she leapt 60,000 Parsa'ot, %0a%3c i.e., she rose so high that she wanted to annul the Parsa below VAK de AA, whose %0a%3c each Sefira is defined as 10,000; hence, its VAK = 6 Sefirot equal 60,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as they think to approach her, she leaps 60,000 Parsa'ot, but %0a%3c immediately falls back down and is unable to touch them, for there is no action %0a%3c in these upper impure forces, and all transgressions and all errors are only in %0a%3c thoughts and intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, there is still enough power in her to deceive and entice people, even %0a%3c if man does not reach the level of impure actions and is only drawn to her in %0a%3c his thoughts and desires. However, the Creator punishes for such thoughts and %0a%3c desires, as He does for actions, as the prophet warns us: "the house of Israel may %0a%3c understand in their own heart" (Yechezkel, 14:5). And the impure force assumes %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Heaven and Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 335 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c several different shapes, such as depravity with married women, murder and %0a%3c other things laid upon Lilit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 158. These two rulers soar in the entire world and then return to their %0a%3c places. And they rouse the sons of Cain's sons with a spirit of evil desires to %0a%3c beget children. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Soar in the entire world"— they bring harm to man in all of their thoughts, %0a%3c wherever they can, and lure him into the darkness of night. For after man sins, %0a%3c they return to their permanent place in Arka, where they rouse the sons of Cain %0a%3c to defile the descendants with impurities. %0a%3c %0a%3c Moreover, The Zohar says that besides pushing the sons of Cain to sin in Arka, %0a%3c they also soar in our world (Tevel), and compel the sons of this land to sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c 159. The Heavens that rule there are not like ours, and the land bears neither %0a%3c seed nor fruit by the power of Heaven, as ours does, and the grains grow again %0a%3c only once in several years. Hence, it is written of them that they could not correct %0a%3c Shemaya and Arka, and perished from the Supernal land, called Tevel, where %0a%3c they will not be able to exist, nor rule over it, nor cause human beings to sin %0a%3c because of the night. Hence, they disappeared from Arka and from the place of %0a%3c Shemaya that were created by the name ELEH (as mentioned in item 14). %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Heavens receive the Light essential for the birth of subsequent Partzufim %0a%3c from ZA, which has Ohr Hochma. Hence, our land, which receives in Malchut de %0a%3c ZA, receives a grain and a seed. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Heavens in Arka do not have the Light to bear fruit and give %0a%3c birth due to the rule of the impure forces that are there. Hence, unlike our land, %0a%3c Arka cannot produce; its land has no power to receive and grow a seed, and this %0a%3c property appears in it only once in several years. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar speaks of the two rulers: Afriron and Kastimon, who could %0a%3c not correct Shemaya and Arka, to make them bear fruit. Therefore, these rulers %0a%3c are not allowed to be here and seduce people in our land (Tevel), to sin, for %0a%3c when they are here, they bring harm to our land so as to make it like their %0a%3c Shemaya and Arka. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar says that they disappeared from the Supernal land of %0a%3c Tevel, from our land, for here they sought to bring harm by the power of the %0a%3c night. They provoke people toward sin by virtue of the night, and it is a curse %0a%3c that hangs over Arka because of their rule there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Heavens were created by the name ELEH, for our Heavens receive %0a%3c from ZA, which was corrected by ELEH's properties, by the words: IN THE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 336 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED, where MI is connected to ELEH. %0a%3c Hence, our land is corrected by the Supernal holiness and purity. Therefore, %0a%3c these two rulers are not allowed to rule here. %0a%3c %0a%3c 160. Hence, there exists a Targum, a translation (from Hebrew to Aramaic, %0a%3c which The Zohar dubs Targum), so the holy angels will not think that it %0a%3c is said about them, so they will not harm us. This is the secret of the word %0a%3c ELEH— as we have already stated, it is a holy word that cannot be translated %0a%3c into a Targum. %0a%3c %0a%3c Everything but the word ELEH has been translated into the language of %0a%3c the Targum, as it is said in item 149, that ELEH disappeared from both Arka %0a%3c and Shemaya, for the word ELEH is untranslatable, as it constitutes the full %0a%3c connection between ELEH and MI, which causes the descent of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c And should anyone sin and corrupt the letters ELEH, as Cain had done, they %0a%3c would fall to the impure forces, so even the holiness of the Targum (VAK of the %0a%3c pure forces) would depart from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages of the Nations %0a%3c of the World, There Are None Like You %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 161. Rabbi Elazar said, "It is written: 'Who would not fear the King of the %0a%3c nations of the world?' What kind of praise is this?" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a%3c "Elazar, my son, this has been said in several places. However, one should %0a%3c not understand the verse, 'For among all the sages of the nations of the %0a%3c world, and in all their kingdoms, there are none like You' in its simple, literal %0a%3c interpretation. This is because it naturally gives rise to evil intentions of %0a%3c sinners— those who think that the Creator is not aware of their dark thoughts, %0a%3c doubts and intents. Therefore, their folly must be clarified. A philosopher %0a%3c of one of the nations of the world came to me and said, 'You say that your %0a%3c Creator governs the entire Heavens, and that all the Heavenly hosts are unable %0a%3c to attain Him, nor come to know His dwelling place. However, this does not %0a%3c add to His greatness, as it is written, 'among all the sages of the nations of %0a%3c the world, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.' What kind of a %0a%3c comparison is this when He is compared to man, who is nothing?'" %0a%3c %0a%3c This is similar to what is written about sinners in Psalms (Tehilim, 73:11-12): %0a%3c "And they say: 'How does the Creator know? And is there knowledge in Him? %0a%3c Behold the wicked; they are always at peace, rich and powerful.'" This is exactly %0a%3c what the philosopher says. He was one of the greatest sages among the nations of %0a%3c the world, and he came to Rabbi Shimon to dishonor Israel's wisdom and work %0a%3c in absolute faith for the Creator's sake, which ought to be in great wholeness, %0a%3c perfection, purity, and integrity, for no thought can grasp Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This sage was a representative of the philosophers who asserted that the %0a%3c main principle in working for the Creator is to attain Him, rather than serve %0a%3c Him in faith, for in their understanding, they attain Him. And now he has %0a%3c come to ridicule Israel's approach. %0a%3c %0a%3c 337 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 338 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he said: "The Creator is above all human wisdom, and thereby He %0a%3c rules, and He bid you to work for Him in faith and purity, and have no doubts in %0a%3c Him, for the human mind cannot grasp Him. After all, even the Heavenly hosts, %0a%3c His legions and angels are unable to attain Him, as it is written of those who say: %0a%3c 'Blessed be the Creator in His place,' for they do not know 'His place.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the phrase, "as among all the sages of the world, there is none like %0a%3c the Creator" does not imply the Creator's greatness. Indeed, if this prophetic %0a%3c expression is used in order to exalt the God of Israel and show that He is greater %0a%3c than the god attained by the sages of the nations of the world by their human %0a%3c strength and reason, then naturally, this does not add to the glory of the God of %0a%3c Israel, as He is being compared to trifle and transient forces. On the contrary, %0a%3c this statement shows great disdain for your Creator, when you compare Him to %0a%3c the sages of the nations of the world, who are mortal and restricted creatures. %0a%3c Those were the words that the scholarly sage, who represented the wisdom of %0a%3c the nations of the world, uttered before Rabbi Shimon. %0a%3c %0a%3c Clearly, The Zohar is referring to some overseas sage who paid a visit to Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon. Just like all the other names of places and characters mentioned in the %0a%3c Torah, the Talmud, and the Kabbalah, names of places, animals, people, and %0a%3c actions described in The Zohar speak only of the spiritual world, the Creator's %0a%3c actions, and how one can achieve the goal of creation. In no way does any of this %0a%3c relate to events in our world! %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the "sage of the nations of the world" symbolizes man's own %0a%3c egoistic property to research and know everything, instead of having faith above %0a%3c reason, as the Torah demands. This human property, called a "sage of the %0a%3c nations of the world," the egoistic reason, is in a state of constant argument %0a%3c with man's spiritual, altruistic property, called "Israel" or the aspiration to the %0a%3c Creator. Thus, by opposing it, man builds himself and grows. %0a%3c %0a%3c 162. Furthermore, you claim, as your Torah says, that "There had not risen %0a%3c a prophet since in Israel like Moshe." There are none in Israel, but there is %0a%3c one among the nations of the world! So I claim the same: there is none like %0a%3c You among all the sages of the nations of the world, but among the sages of %0a%3c Israel there is one like You. However, if there is one like Him among the sages %0a%3c of Israel, then He cannot be the Supreme Ruler. Look closely into my words, %0a%3c and you shall see that I am right. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here the philosopher (man's egoistic voice) spoke wisely. He understood %0a%3c that should he speak directly, he would hear precise answers to his questions. It %0a%3c is written: "Among all the sages of the nations of the world, there are none like %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 339 %0a%3c %0a%3c You," meaning that there is no one that can attain You. For the words, "there %0a%3c are none like You" imply that You have no equals, that it is impossible to attain %0a%3c You, attain Your degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the sages of the nations of the world (human reason) take %0a%3c pride in their attainment of the Creator (that they understand His intentions %0a%3c and actions), they consider themselves similar to Him, for attainment means %0a%3c similarity of properties with the attained degree. This is why it is considered a %0a%3c lie, and that there are none like Him, for they do not attain the Creator, but %0a%3c only delude themselves by thinking that they do. %0a%3c %0a%3c The philosopher (within man) understood that, and hence began (leading %0a%3c man astray from the path of faith, which surpasses and defies reason) with a %0a%3c completely different question: "If it is explicitly said that no one is equal to the %0a%3c Creator among the sages of the other nations, does it not mean that there are %0a%3c those who can attain Him among the sages of Israel? Otherwise, why would it be %0a%3c necessary to specify that there are none like Him among the sages of the nations %0a%3c of the world? %0a%3c %0a%3c "But if this is so, and He is similar to you, then He cannot be the Supreme %0a%3c Ruler! Thus, how can you say that the God of Israel cannot be attained by %0a%3c reason and that He governs all? You speak by means of faith in His greatness, %0a%3c but indeed there are those among your sages who are like Him, i.e., those who %0a%3c attain Him." %0a%3c %0a%3c 163. Rabbi Shimon said to him, "You object correctly that there are those %0a%3c among the sages of Israel who are similar to the Creator, for who resurrects %0a%3c the dead back to life, if not the Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu and Elisha %0a%3c came and resurrected the dead back to life! Who causes rain to fall if not the %0a%3c Creator Himself? Yet, Eliyahu came and abolished rain, and then summoned %0a%3c it through his prayer! Who created the Heavens and the earth, if not the %0a%3c Creator Himself? Yet, Avraham came, and, as it is written, the Heavens and %0a%3c the earth were revived." %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon replies that the (inner) sage speaks the truth when he %0a%3c asserts that there are those among the sages of Israel who are similar to the %0a%3c Creator. However, in no way does this revoke the simple faith in the Creator's %0a%3c unattainability by human reason. Of course, He is the master and ruler of the %0a%3c Heavens, and He is so much higher than all of them that even the Supernal %0a%3c angels cannot attain Him and do not know His place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Torah and Mitzvot (commandments) were given to us precisely for %0a%3c this purpose— so that by observing the Mitzvot (making a Zivug between the screen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 340 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and the Light) and studying the Torah (receiving the Light) for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, we, Israel (those who aspire to the Creator) would completely merge with %0a%3c Him (in our properties), so His Light would permeate us and clothe in us to %0a%3c such an extent that we would merit (begin to desire and receive the power of %0a%3c a screen) carrying out the same actions as the Creator: resurrecting the dead %0a%3c (correcting egoism), summoning rains (Ohr Hassadim), and reviving Heaven and %0a%3c earth (filling all the Partzufim in all the worlds with the Light of our actions). %0a%3c %0a%3c In that, we are just like Him, as it is said: "By Your deeds (by experiencing %0a%3c them on myself) I will know You." However, we attain all this only through %0a%3c absolute and devout faith (the property of Bind), which leaves within us no %0a%3c desires whatsoever to attain Him with our reason (to verify first and act next), %0a%3c as in the path of sages of the nations of the world (our egoism). Our egoism %0a%3c consists of a Partzuf called a "sage of the nations of the world." Its Rosh (head) %0a%3c designates knowledge and desire to attain everything, and its Guf (body) is the %0a%3c will to receive pleasure for oneself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The philosopher argues that if Israel can do what the Creator does, then %0a%3c Israel attains Him. This is correct, for if one is able to act like the Creator, then, %0a%3c to the extent of his actions, he attains and perceives Him. After all, it is said: "By %0a%3c Your deeds I will know You." If one acts like the Creator, then he understands %0a%3c the Creator's analogous actions in his own actions, and thus perceives Him. %0a%3c However, one must first advance by faith above reason, and as a result, he attains %0a%3c the Creator's properties, thereby becoming like Him in his actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c 164. (Rabbi Shimon continues:) "Who governs the sun, if not the Creator? %0a%3c Yet, Yehoshua came and stopped it. The Creator issues His decree, yet Moshe %0a%3c immediately issues a decree of his own, and it is carried out. The Creator wishes %0a%3c to punish, and the righteous of Israel annul His verdict. Moreover, He bid us %0a%3c to closely follow His ways and to be like Him in every way." The philosopher %0a%3c then went and became Israel, and lived in the village of Shachalayim, and they %0a%3c called him Yosi HaKatan (Little Yosi). He studied the Torah a great deal, and %0a%3c was among the sages and the righteous of that village. %0a%3c %0a%3c The problem is that if a person does everything only by means of his faith, %0a%3c he denies himself the chance to attain the Creator, for attainment comes %0a%3c through applying reason. However, the moment he begins to apply his reason, he %0a%3c immediately diminishes his faith. So how can one combine faith with reason? %0a%3c %0a%3c It is true that those who aspire to draw nearer the Creator (those who are %0a%3c called Israel) diminish their simple, devout faith. However, they do this only %0a%3c because He bids them to do so in order to attain His actions, and thus become %0a%3c like Him, as it is said in the Torah: "Follow His way" (Devarim, 21). Hence, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You 341 %0a%3c %0a%3c they observe His commandments. The philosopher was so overwhelmed by this %0a%3c truth that he became "Israel" and started observing the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c He was overwhelmed when he had found that Israel's actions, their %0a%3c attainments of the spiritual worlds, did not diminish their faith above reason, for %0a%3c all of their actions and attainments were based on faith. Israel attains the Creator %0a%3c because He bids them to, not because they desire this with their egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c 165. And now the time has come to take a closer look at this verse. It is %0a%3c written that all the nations of the world are nothing before Him. Yet, how %0a%3c does this exalt Him? Hence, it is written: "Who sees the King of the nations %0a%3c of the world?" Yet, is the King of the nations of the world also not the King of %0a%3c Israel? The Creator wishes to elevate Israel in all places; this is why He is called %0a%3c everywhere "the King of Israel." The other nations of the world say that they %0a%3c have another King up in the Heavens, for it seems to them that He governs %0a%3c only them, and not us. %0a%3c %0a%3c The nations of the world are certain that their Supernal King is not the %0a%3c King of Israel, that the King who sits in the Heavens and governs them is %0a%3c only their King, and that the King of Israel has no power over them. Thus, it %0a%3c seems to man's egoism that it exists under some other (non-altruistic) system of %0a%3c governance, and not altruism. The egoism fails to realize that the Creator made %0a%3c it exactly the way it is so as to achieve His goal: using egoism, to bring man to %0a%3c altruism, from "for one's own self to "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c 166. It is written: "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" %0a%3c (Xirmiyahu, 10:7) That is, their Supernal King is there to threaten and %0a%3c persecute them, and do with them as He pleases. Hence, He should be feared. %0a%3c And all fear Him Above and below. For it is written that among all the sages of %0a%3c the nations of the world (the angels that rule over these nations) and in their %0a%3c Kingdoms (Above) there is none like You. There are four Kingdoms Above %0a%3c that rule over all the nations of the world according to the Creator's will. And %0a%3c there is no one who can do even the smallest action without His personal %0a%3c instruction. The sages of the nations of the world are the forces that rule them %0a%3c from Above, and all the wisdom of the nations of the world comes from these %0a%3c rulers. "In all their Kingdoms" means that the Creator's will rules over them. %0a%3c %0a%3c These lines describe how the bride, who is in a state of exile, prepares herself %0a%3c for her future, final correction. The power of the nations of the world (in every %0a%3c one of us) amounts to conquering us (the altruistic desires for the Creator) and %0a%3c placing us under their power (serving only the body). They wish to drive us away %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 342 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the Creator's rule and let other desires, called "the nations of the world" %0a%3c dominate us. Our egoistic desires, the nations of the world, do so because of %0a%3c their power (tempting us with various pleasures) and wisdom (appealing to our %0a%3c common sense). %0a%3c %0a%3c Their actions over us (spiritual aspirations) stem from the system of the %0a%3c impure forces and their impure (egoistic) angels (our inner egoistic forces), %0a%3c which give power and reason to the nations of the world. With the help of %0a%3c their wisdom, they (our egoistic desires) lead us (the sons of Israel, those who %0a%3c aspire only to the Creator) to all sorts of doubts and desires to understand %0a%3c the Creator, His ways and thoughts, without any fear or reverence before His %0a%3c greatness and supremacy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of these doubts, we draw far from the Creator and His Supernal %0a%3c Light, which, as a result, passes on to them (our egoistic desires), as it is %0a%3c written, "Tzur (the capital of the impure forces) was built only on the ruins of %0a%3c Jerusalem (the capital of the pure forces)." Thus, they acquire the strength to %0a%3c persecute and humiliate Israel, and force them to submit to their will (suppress %0a%3c the only true path to the spiritual— faith above and in defiance of reason— with %0a%3c their persuasions and proof of their "real" rightfulness). And as it was already %0a%3c explained in the "Introduction to the Book of Zohar" (items 69-71), our inner %0a%3c spiritual enslavement leads to our external, corporeal enslavement, persecution, %0a%3c and humiliation by the nations of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the secret of the four Kingdoms that rule over us in our four (spiritual %0a%3c and therefore physical) exiles, which correspond to Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, symbolized %0a%3c by Nebuchadnezzar, as it is written: "Here is that idol, its head made of pure %0a%3c gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass, its shins of %0a%3c iron, and its feet part iron and part clay" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%3c %0a%3c When this idol governs us, the nations of the world mock us, claiming %0a%3c that they have a King of their own. However, such was the Creator's plan, as %0a%3c it is said: "The Creator hath so made it, that men should fear Him" (Kohelet, %0a%3c 3:14), for the sensation of the Creator, called Shechina, is also referred to as fear %0a%3c before Him. However, since we do not yet feel the greatness and supremacy of %0a%3c the Creator, we do not merit fearing Him, and live in fear of the King of the %0a%3c nations of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c This points to the fact that we have no other way of completely and eternally %0a%3c merging with the Creator other than by means of tremendous fear before His %0a%3c greatness, by assuming His Torah and His desires (Mitzvot) in devout and %0a%3c complete faith, without any doubts in His properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 343 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Only then will we merge with Him in absolute, eternal union, and the %0a%3c Creator will impart us with all the goodness for which He had created us. He %0a%3c conceived this in the beginning of creation, and it became the purpose behind %0a%3c the whole of creation. This state is considered the complete and final deliverance %0a%3c and correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, before the attainment of such an exalted spiritual state, this is how %0a%3c the prophet describes those who aspire to the Creator: "You have sown much, %0a%3c and brought in little; you eat but you have not enough; you drink but your thirst %0a%3c is not quenched" (Haggai, 1:6), for in all of our actions (of those who aspire to %0a%3c the spiritual) the impure force (egoism) constantly takes all the Light for itself. %0a%3c This occurs as a result of our doubts with regard to faith in the Creator, which %0a%3c the impure force itself cultivates within us. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the purpose of these punishments is not to cause us grief! Everything %0a%3c happens according to the Creator's plan and serves only to promote us toward %0a%3c correction. Therefore, as long as man can listen only to egoistic arguments, the %0a%3c Creator develops us gradually, using these forces. With their help, we gradually %0a%3c become fit to feel fear of the Creator, through the many trials and sufferings our %0a%3c %0a%3c But in the end, we merit the reception of complete and devoted faith and fear %0a%3c before His greatness. It is written of this state: "He remembered His mercy and His %0a%3c allegiance toward the house of Israel, and all the worthless creatures of the earth %0a%3c witnessed the help and deliverance at the Creator's hands" (Tehilim, 98:3). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because at the end of days, the Creator will remember us in His %0a%3c mercy, and will give us the strength to receive complete and devout faith in Him. %0a%3c Thus, Jerusalem (the capital of altruism) will be rebuilt on the ruins of Tzur %0a%3c (the capital of egoism), for all the Light, which Malchut of the impure force was %0a%3c robbing of us throughout our exile from the spiritual, will return to us when we %0a%3c acquire complete and devout faith, and will shine within us with all its might. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the worthless creatures of the earth (manifestations of egoism) will then %0a%3c see with their own eyes how our Creator saves (corrects) them. For all the nations %0a%3c of the world (within us) will see that they have always possessed this Light until %0a%3c the very last moment before their correction so as to give it back to us at the %0a%3c appropriate time. And all shall see that "one man's rule over another is to the %0a%3c detriment of the ruler!" (Kohelet, 8:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c The burden of our slavery and the impure force's rule over us (over holiness) %0a%3c harms only the impure force, for it thereby compels us to attain complete and %0a%3c devoted faith in the Creator even faster! And the prophet speaks of this time, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 344 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c At they %0a%3c „He m %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c "Who would not fear the King of the nations of the world?" for it has now been %0a%3c revealed that He is the King of the nations of the world, who persecutes and %0a%3c dominates those nations. It previously seemed to them (our egoistic intentions) %0a%3c that they persecuted us (our altruistic intentions), but now the opposite has %0a%3c been revealed to them— that they were merely blind enactors of the Creator's %0a%3c will, our servants and our slaves, whose purpose is to bring us to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c It seemed to us that they were beating us. Now it turns out that they were beat- %0a%3c ; themselves, for thanks to these blows (suffering from unrealized egoistic desires %0a%3c it frustration), they have accelerated our deliverance and attainr %0a%3c )ur realization of the need to choose the path of faith above re %0a%3c have also accelerated their own demise (their own correctior %0a%3c %0a%3c And wherever it seemed to us (our reason) that they rebelled against the %0a%3c Creator (argued that the Creator is not the source of all reality) and acted %0a%3c (supposedly) however they pleased so as to humiliate us and satiate their base %0a%3c egoistic desires, and it appeared that there was no (Supernal) judge and no law %0a%3c (the advancement of creation toward its goal), it has now been revealed that they %0a%3c have always been fulfilling the Creator's will, to bring us (all our desires, %0a%3c included) to perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to every person in the world— whether he wants to or not, %0a%3c at all times and in every way, he fulfills only the Creator's will. Why then is he %0a%3c not called the Creator's servant? Because he acts unconsciously, not of his own %0a%3c will. To compel man to fulfill His will, the Creator gives him some alien desire %0a%3c to enjoy, which forces him to carry out an action, but he does so as a slave of his %0a%3c and not as someone who fulfills the Creator's will. %0a%3c %0a%3c ample, the Creator may give man an alien desire %0a%3c vpelling him to open a restaurant so as to carry out : %0a%3c egoistic desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, to compel us to do what is necessary, the Creator created %0a%3c within us an egoistic desire to receive pleasure, thus obliging us to do His will %0a%3c by enabling us to find pleasure in the actions and objects on which He wants %0a%3c us to work. This is why we live in constant chase of pleasures, whereas in truth %0a%3c istantly and unconsciously fulfilling the Creator's will. This resembles %0a%3c which children are given many toys to play with, but as they play, %0a%3c vork. %0a%3c %0a%3c rid is doing the Creator's will, but our goal, the pur %0a%3c lopment is to do it consciously. We must attain and realize His %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c . so as a slave of his %0a%3c %0a%3c e to make money, %0a%3c it altruistic actions %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Among All the Sages, There Are None Like You %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 345 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c rather than as we do it now— unconsciously and coercively. We must achieve a %0a%3c state when our desires fully coincide with those of the Creator, which designates %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it becomes clear that the King of the nations of the world is the same %0a%3c Creator that rules over them and compels them to fulfill all His desires, as a %0a%3c King does with his slaves. And now fear before the Creator is revealed to all %0a%3c the nations of the world. The phrase, "all the nations of the world" alludes to %0a%3c the angels that rule over those nations, such as Afriron, Kastimon, Aza, Azael %0a%3c and others, from whom the sages of the nations of the world (our egoism and %0a%3c reason) receive their wisdom, and with whose help they oppress Israel (our %0a%3c altruistic desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THEIR KINGDOMS refers to the four existing Kingdoms, which %0a%3c govern the seventy nations of the world (ZON = seven Sefirot, each of which %0a%3c containing ten sub-Se/irot: in all seventy Sefirot) and over us (altruistic aspirations) %0a%3c in our four exiles, which correspond to the impure Sefirot H-B-ZA-M (described %0a%3c as Nebuchadnezzar). As the prophet writes: "Here is that idol, its head made %0a%3c of pure gold (the first Kingdom), its breast and its arms of silver (the second %0a%3c Kingdom), its belly and its thighs of brass (the third Kingdom), its shins of iron, %0a%3c its feet part iron and part clay (the fourth Kingdom)" (Daniel, 2:32-33). %0a%3c %0a%3c There is not one among them who can make even the smallest action of %0a%3c their own, but only what You bid them. However, this will only be revealed at %0a%3c the end of correction, and all will know that all of our misfortunes and suffering %0a%3c that had the power to separate us from the Creator were but loyal executors of %0a%3c the Creator's aspiration to draw us closer to Him. Moreover, these cruel forces %0a%3c did nothing else but obey His orders. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the sole purpose of all that transpired was to bring us to a state where %0a%3c we can receive all the perfection and infinite goodness that He intended to %0a%3c bestow upon us from the very beginning in His plan of creation. The Creator %0a%3c must lead us to complete and devout faith, the result of which will be, as the %0a%3c prophet said: "Then, at once, the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the %0a%3c gold all crumbled to pieces and became like the chaff on summer threshing- %0a%3c floors; and the wind carried them away, and no trace was left of them; and the %0a%3c stone that smote their image became a great mountain, and filled the whole %0a%3c earth" (Daniel, 2:35). %0a%3c %0a%3c Absolute faith is called "unbreakable (non-crumbling) stone." After one %0a%3c merits absolute faith, the impure force (his inner egoistic desires and thoughts) %0a%3c disappears as though it had never existed. And all the worthless creatures %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 346 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (reason, logic, philosophy, and common sense), which inhabit the earth, witness %0a%3c deliverance at the hands of the Creator, as the prophet said: "They shall not %0a%3c do evil nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the %0a%3c knowledge of the Lord, as the waters fill the sea" (Yeshayahu, 11:9). %0a%3c %0a%3c 167. Yet, among all the sages of the nations of the world and in all their %0a%3c kingdoms, I have found in the ancient books that even though the Heavenly %0a%3c hosts and legions fully obeyed their given orders and each would receive precise %0a%3c instructions to be carried out, but who among them can do it if not You, who %0a%3c will do it better than You? For You excel over them all in both properties and %0a%3c deeds. Hence, it is written: "There is none like You." %0a%3c %0a%3c itures' actions with His Light, %0a%3c to His goal. Man's sole task is the realization of all creation ar %0a%3c ;rnance, to wholeheartedly agree with all of the Creator's actions, ar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 168. Rabbi Shimon said to his friends: "This wedding must be a wedding for %0a%3c all of you, and each of you should bring a gift (his own part in the common %0a%3c Malchut) to the Bride." He said to Rabbi Elazar, his son: "Present the Bride %0a%3c with a gift, for on the following day Zeir Anpin will look as he enters the %0a%3c wedding canopy at the sound of these songs and praises of the sons of the %0a%3c wedding canopy, who stand before the Creator." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 169. Rabbi Elazar opened and said, "Who is this coming up from the %0a%3c wasteland?" (Shir HaShirim, 3:6). MI ZOT— who is this— is the common %0a%3c ground of the two questions, the two worlds, Bina and Malchut, which are %0a%3c bound together. COMING UP— coming up to become the "Holy of Holies." %0a%3c For MI is Bina, called the Holy of Holies. And she joins with ZOT (Malchut), %0a%3c so that Malchut could come up FROM THE WASTELAND, for she inherits %0a%3c THIS from the wasteland, to become a bride and enter the bridal canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar explains the following passage: "Who is this coming up from the %0a%3c wasteland, leaning upon her beloved!?" (Shir HaShirim, 8:5). It describes a state %0a%3c at the end of correction, when the bride enters the wedding canopy. MI ZOT: %0a%3c MI is Bina and ZOT is Malchut. At the end of correction, Bina and Malchut %0a%3c unite, and both are called "holy." But until the end of correction only Bina is %0a%3c called holy, while Malchut ascends to Bina and receives holiness from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, at the end of correction, Malchut becomes like Bina, and they %0a%3c both become holy. Malchut completely unites with Bina through equivalence %0a%3c of form, and fully merges with the source of life, for a screen (the restriction %0a%3c imposed on reception of Light within Malchut) creates the Returning Light that %0a%3c combines all Sefirot into one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's Ohr Hochma can be received precisely in this Returning Light. %0a%3c As a result, Malchut ends with the letter Yod and becomes forever similar to Bina. %0a%3c Hence, it is written that Malchut and Bina unite by equalizing their desires to %0a%3c form a single whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Light of Malchut will be forever connected to the Light of Bina, %0a%3c for Malchut herself ascends to the level of the "Holy of Holies," thus becoming %0a%3c exactly like Bina. SHE COMES UP just like a sacrifice, which is the "Holy of %0a%3c Holies," for MI (AVI, Bina or the "Holy of Holies") joins ZOT (Malchut), so %0a%3c %0a%3c 347 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 348 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut would ascend and become the "Holy of Holies." Sacrifice is the part of %0a%3c Malchut (man's animal egoism) that ascends with its properties to Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when MI (Bina) joins ZOT (Malchut), and ZOT becomes the "Holy of %0a%3c Holies," there is no longer a diminution of Malchut's state, for this diminution %0a%3c occurred only because of the deterioration of Malchut's properties, when new %0a%3c egoistic desires emerge within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now that Malchut has become as holy (altruistic) in her properties as Bina, %0a%3c death disappears, and the fall of Malchut into her egoistic desires is impossible, %0a%3c for she has been fully corrected and has attained the properties of Bina, which are %0a%3c referred to as holy. Through Malchut's acquisition of these properties, the Upper %0a%3c Light (life) enters her. Malchut emerges from the wasteland (the sensation of %0a%3c life's absence for want of altruistic properties) and enters her wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs thanks to man's efforts, called "those who keep the Torah" %0a%3c (item 124). These efforts are the foremost part of creation, for they create the %0a%3c Torah and bring Malchut to the great Zivug at the end of her correction, to her %0a%3c complete fulfillment with the Light. This great Zivug on the entire corrected %0a%3c Malchut (including Malchut de Malchut) can be achieved by precisely this sensation %0a%3c (by man) of the spiritual wasteland. %0a%3c %0a%3c 170. She comes up from the wasteland of the soft utterance of lips, as it is %0a%3c written, "And your mouth is comely" (Shir HaShirim, 4:3). This is because %0a%3c the Hebrew word Midbar (desert/wasteland) is derived from Dibur (speech). %0a%3c It is written of the mighty forces, that these mighty forces strike Egypt with all %0a%3c the plagues of the wasteland, for all that the Creator did to them was not in %0a%3c the wasteland, but in settlements. And the phrase "in the wasteland" means %0a%3c "by the power of speech, of spoken word." This comes up from articulation, %0a%3c from the mouth (Malchut) as she ascends and comes under the wings of Ima %0a%3c (mother, Bina). Then, through speech, she descends upon the entire holy %0a%3c nation (the difference between speech and articulation is that articulation is %0a%3c an action that forms speech). %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the end of correction, when Malchut is still called the "Tree of Good %0a%3c and Evil," all corrections occur through MAN (prayers or requests), through %0a%3c which the righteous (those who wish to become similar to the Creator in their %0a%3c properties) elevate Malchut to Bina. Consequently, Malchut receives Bina's %0a%3c properties for as long as Malchut remains there, for spiritual ascent signifies an %0a%3c attainment of properties. Malchut becomes as holy (altruistic) as Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN is a silent prayer in the heart of man, for Malchut signifies "speech." %0a%3c Yet, until the end of correction, good words cannot exist without bad ones. That %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 349 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is, this will not happen until both voice and speech come from Bina herself, when %0a%3c Malchut becomes like Bina, which designates the unity of voice and speech— the %0a%3c Zivug of ZON in their corrected state of Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA receives the voice from Ima and passes it in his speech to Malchut. Hence, %0a%3c this speech is completely good, devoid of any evil. Thus, Malchut receives from %0a%3c Bina the Light of holiness, Hassadim. Unless it is corrected by the completely %0a%3c good, altruistic voice of Bina, Malchut's voice will always consist of both good %0a%3c and evil. This is why impure, egoistic forces cling to her, and Malchut cannot %0a%3c receive anything from holiness (Bina). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, MAN that the righteous raise in their prayers is like a soft murmur %0a%3c of lips, a voiceless speech, as the prophet says: "Only the lips move, but the %0a%3c voice cannot be heard" (Shmuel I, 1:13). This is because there is no connection %0a%3c between MAN and the impure force, and Malchut can be elevated to Bina so she %0a%3c can receive her voice from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, a holy edifice of Malchut is erected, and she receives the %0a%3c Light from a Zivug between voice and speech, and the holiness of her speech %0a%3c descends upon the heads of the righteous that raised MAN and thereby %0a%3c revived Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that SHE COMES UP FROM THE WASTELAND, %0a%3c for the bride (Malchut) is now invited to a great Zivug under the wedding canopy. %0a%3c This occurs thanks to the raising of MAN by the righteous, who thereby united %0a%3c Bina (voice, Ima) with Malchut (speech). As a result, Malchut's speech became as %0a%3c beautiful as that of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of these individual Zivugim made by the various righteous (each of whom %0a%3c constitutes a small part of the common Malchut) during the 6,000 years, now %0a%3c connect all of Malchut 's parts (souls of the righteous) together in one great Zivug, %0a%3c as the bride (Malchut) enters her wedding canopy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, it is precisely this soft prayer, the raising of MAN during the %0a%3c 6,000 years by a voiceless speech (seeing as good is still mixed with evil in the %0a%3c voice of Malchut), that creates the conditions for the great Zivug of Malchut with %0a%3c ZA, of man with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Malchut received the voice of Bina (from Ima-Mother) thanks %0a%3c to the help of the righteous (all the good deeds performed by the righteous %0a%3c during the 6,000 years), everything is now combined into the great Supernal %0a%3c Zivug under the wedding canopy. This is because Malchut becomes completely %0a%3c good without a hint of evil— the "Holy of Holies," just like Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 350 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Silent speech is defined as the movement of lips without the participation of %0a%3c the palate, larynx, tongue, and teeth. This is how MAN is raised when Malchut %0a%3c ascends between the wings of Bina, i.e., receives the voice of the wings of Ima %0a%3c in her speech. Afterwards, having acquired the speech, she descends upon the %0a%3c heads of the holy nation. For after the reception of voice through Ima 's property %0a%3c of mercy, Malchut becomes as holy as Bina herself, and her holiness descends %0a%3c upon those who corrected her. Consequently, they are called the "holy nation," %0a%3c for now the speech of Malchut is as holy as that of Ima-Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is "voice" and there is "speech." "Voice" is the inner part, whereas %0a%3c "speech" is its outward appearance. This appearance is based on exhaling (the %0a%3c silent letter Hey). ZA is called "voice," and Malchut is called "speech." Letters %0a%3c are sung according to the note signs (Taamim), followed by the letters with their %0a%3c punctuation marks. %0a%3c %0a%3c The level of Ohr Haya (called Kol— voice) emerges on the screen in the Peh of %0a%3c the third degree of thickness, known as "teeth." From this Light ZA receives Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and his voice is then heard outside (begets the souls of the lower ones). %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the voice of ZA is not heard below the level of Neshama, for his screen is %0a%3c not strong enough to receive Ohr Hochma. The level of Ohr Yechida in ZA, called %0a%3c Dibur (speech), emerges on the screen in the Peh of the fourth degree of thickness. %0a%3c This screen is the most powerful, as it reveals all of the Light, and is called "lips." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of NRNHY reveals the inner, Supernal and concealed wisdom, %0a%3c Hochma, the concealed thought, the inner Light of Bina, which cannot shine %0a%3c to the lower ones, that is, in ZA, because ZON cannot receive from Peh de AA. %0a%3c Nevertheless, the two levels of the Light— Haya and Yechida— that descend from %0a%3c AA are converted into voice and speech with Bina 's help, even though it is the %0a%3c Light of thought, wisdom and reason. %0a%3c %0a%3c Voice is formed in ZA, and speech in Malchut. If a righteous one raises his %0a%3c prayers (MAN) to Malchut, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI, who are in %0a%3c constant union, to provide Light for the lower ones, ZON receive this Light %0a%3c from AVI, which is called "voice and speech." The property of the righteous is to %0a%3c create the pure and destroy the impure with their voice. In the beginning, there %0a%3c was only one language (one speech) in the world, Lashon HaKodesh— the holy %0a%3c language. In Hebrew (as in English) the same word (Lashon) means "tongue" %0a%3c (both as a body part and as a means of communication). %0a%3c %0a%3c 171. He asks: "How does Malchut ascend in speech?" And he replies: "When %0a%3c man first awakens in the morning and opens his eyes, he must bless his %0a%3c Creator and Master. How is he to bless Him? The way it was done by the first %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 351 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hassidimi they would prepare a vessel of water beside them, so that when they %0a%3c woke at night, they would wash their hands at once, and, having blessed the %0a%3c Torah, would rise to study it. When the rooster crowed, precisely heralding %0a%3c midnight, the Creator was with the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And it %0a%3c is forbidden to perform a blessing in the morning with unclean hands." %0a%3c %0a%3c He asks: since it is written that the beginning of Malchut's correction must %0a%3c be expressed in a quiet murmur of lips, how can he who wakes up (spiritually) %0a%3c immediately pronounce a blessing at the top of his voice? After all, the blessing %0a%3c must also be uttered in whisper so as to first receive a voice from Ima, and with %0a%3c this voice (by the force of Ima-Bina) elevate Malchut to Bina, and impart onto her %0a%3c altruistic properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar replies: The first Hassidim have corrected this. As man falls asleep %0a%3c (falls to the level of the Light in his Partzuf called "sleep"), his holy soul (the %0a%3c Light that was in his spiritual Partzuf) ascends, and only the impure spirit of the %0a%3c primordial serpent (egoistic properties) remains in him, for sleep constitutes the %0a%3c 60 th part of death (Talmud, Berachot, 57:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since death is an impure property of the primordial serpent, the impure %0a%3c spirit (egoistic desires) does not leave man completely as he wakes up (receives %0a%3c a new Light from Above), but remains on man's fingertips (not all of man's %0a%3c desires change under the influence of the Light received from Above, called %0a%3c "the Light of morning" or "the Light of awakening"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And the greater holiness and Light that was present in man before he fell %0a%3c asleep (before he fell into a diminished spiritual state, called "sleep"), the more %0a%3c the impure (egoistic) force clings to these desires when the altruistic intentions %0a%3c exit them during sleep. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fingertips constitute the purest place (desires) of the entire body (all desires), %0a%3c man's most spiritual desires, for they can be filled with Ohr Hochma (Ohr Hochma %0a%3c enters these desires during a Zivug, with the help of a screen). Therefore, even %0a%3c after awakening (at the beginning of the spiritual ascent), the impure (egoistic) %0a%3c force does not leave this place, wishing to receive at least some of that great %0a%3c Light, which can fill these most altruistic human desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, hands must be washed in order to remove the residual egoistic %0a%3c desires. For this to happen, two vessels need to be prepared: the Upper One %0a%3c (cup) and the lower one that will accept the removed impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Vessel designates Bina, whose Light drives the impure force away. %0a%3c Hence, washing the fingertips with water (the forces or desires of Bina) expels %0a%3c the impure force (man's egoistic desires) from them. Thus, Malchut rids herself %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 352 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of her evil (egoism) and becomes holy and good. Afterwards, one can study the %0a%3c Torah and bless the Creator for it, for washing hands is similar to raising MAN %0a%3c in a whispered prayer to the wings of Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the rooster crows (this is a special spiritual sign of the angel %0a%3c Gavriel), it is precisely midnight, as it is written: "The greater star to rule the day %0a%3c and the lesser star to rule the night" (Beresheet, 1:16). For the lesser star, the holy %0a%3c Shechina-Malchut grew smaller, clothed in impure forces and "her feet descend %0a%3c to death" (Mishley, 5:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because during the 6,000 years, up to her final correction, %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the Tree (foundations) of Good and Evil: if one is worthy, %0a%3c she becomes good for him and purifies him, if not— she turns evil. Accordingly, %0a%3c the rule of night is also divided into two parts: the first refers to a state called %0a%3c "unworthy— evil," and the second refers to a state called "worthy— good." %0a%3c %0a%3c The first correction of Malchut's good part is made exactly at midnight (in a %0a%3c state so called "midnight"), for it is then that Malchut receives the voice of Bina. %0a%3c Put differently, Malchut ascends to Malchut de Ima-Bina and corrects herself %0a%3c within it. As a result, the strictness and judgment in Malchut become holy and %0a%3c good, completely devoid of evil. This means that strictness and judgment fall %0a%3c onto the impure forces, but for Israel, they turn into mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak signifies restriction, the property of Malchut within Bina. The %0a%3c Hebrew word for a "rooster" is Tarnegol, and also Gever (man) and designates %0a%3c the angel Gavriel, who attends to Malchut, the lesser star. The strictness of Bina %0a%3c pierces the wings of the rooster (Gavriel), and through it Malchut receives the %0a%3c voice of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when Gavriel passes the voice of Bina to Malchut, his call reaches all %0a%3c the roosters of this world, the property of judgment in the spiritual void. Such %0a%3c a state is called "this world" or Malchut de Malchut. Everyone speaks only in this %0a%3c voice, which was corrected by Bina's property of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the voice of Malchut (her judgment) no longer dominates the %0a%3c second half of the night, and the voice of Bina claims this place. This is what the %0a%3c "rooster of this world" heralds— the property of judgment in Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, a rooster's crow (change of properties) is heard precisely at midnight %0a%3c (when states change), for this crow means that Malchut has already been corrected %0a%3c by the voice of Bina, and that this voice is already within Malchut. This is defined %0a%3c as the moment of midnight, which marks the beginning of the second half- %0a%3c absolute goodness, devoid of evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Who Is This? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 353 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut receives the voice of Bina, the righteous (man's properties in %0a%3c the worlds of BYA) raise MAN with the help of their study of To rah after (in the %0a%3c state of) midnight. They keep raising MAN to the "cheerful strictness" in Ima, of %0a%3c which it is written: "She rises also while it is yet night" (Mishley, 31:15), for it is %0a%3c precisely at night that the Supernal Malchut reveals herself in all her splendor. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the actual revelation of Malchut takes place in the Garden of Eden, i.e., %0a%3c she is meant for those righteous who have corrected her with their work and %0a%3c studies (in the state) after midnight. The Creator rejoices with them (merriment %0a%3c signifies fulfillment with Ohr Hochma) in the Garden of Eden, for the corrected %0a%3c Malchut is called "the Holy Shechina" or "the Garden of Eden," for she receives %0a%3c Hochma and rejoices with the righteous that constitute MAN within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the phrase that describes how impurity (egoistic desires) is washed away %0a%3c (corrected to altruistic properties) from man's fingers (his most exalted desires) %0a%3c is true not only with regard to nighttime. Man ascends from the lower degree %0a%3c of "sleep" onto a higher degree of "awakening," the difference between the two %0a%3c states being that previously, he was receiving only the vital Ohr Hassadim, called %0a%3c "sleep," while "awakening" signifies reception of Ohr Hochma. This is because %0a%3c the impure force constantly clings to man's fingertips (precisely for man to %0a%3c correct it and thus attain greater spiritual heights), and he is obliged to wash his %0a%3c hands (make his desires and intentions "for the Creator's sake") before uttering %0a%3c a blessing (appealing to the Creator for reception). %0a%3c %0a%3c 172. For when man is asleep, his soul (spirit) leaves him. And as soon as his soul %0a%3c departs from him, the impure spirit replaces it at once, and it fills his hands %0a%3c and defiles them, and it is forbidden to utter a blessing without washing one's %0a%3c hands. And should you object that when man is awake and his soul does not %0a%3c leave him, the impure force does not descend upon him, then, if he enters a %0a%3c washroom, he is forbidden from reading even a single word of the Torah until %0a%3c he washes his hands. And if you say that it is because his hands are soiled, this %0a%3c is not true, for how are they soiled? %0a%3c %0a%3c 173. But woe unto those who do not beware and do not guard the Creator's %0a%3c honor and do not know the foundation of this world. There is a certain spirit %0a%3c that dwells in every cesspool of the world, a spirit that relishes depravity and %0a%3c excrement, and it immediately settles on the fingers of man's hands. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just like Rabbi Y. Ashlag, I refrain from commenting on items 172 and 173 %0a%3c of The Zohar, and he who merits it— will understand this text himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 174. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "He who rejoices on holidays and does %0a%3c not give a part to the Creator, the evil eye hates and slanders him, removes %0a%3c him from this world, and brings him many miseries." %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already said (item 68) that the impure forces (egoistic spiritual %0a%3c forces within man that know of and hence desire the pleasures hidden in the %0a%3c Creator's Light) consist of male and female parts. The male part brings less harm %0a%3c than the female. It leads man to transgressions such as lying in the name of the %0a%3c Creator, as though it inspires man to observe the Mitzvot, but not in complete %0a%3c purity (with the sole purpose of pleasing the Creator). Instead, it causes man %0a%3c to also add a touch of personal benefit and selfish enjoyment, as it is written: %0a%3c "Eat not the bread of an ill-willer, nor desire his treats; for as one reckons within %0a%3c himself, such is he: 'Eat and drink,' he shall say to you; but his heart is not with %0a%3c you" (Mishley, 23:6-7). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the male impure force has absolutely no intentions to bestow, the %0a%3c commandment remains devoid of fear and love (without a heart). Yet, since the %0a%3c male impure force has already caught man in its net, it gains power to make a %0a%3c Zivug with its female half (the impure Nukva), which is a bitter and evil impure %0a%3c force that lies in the name of the Creator, and, upon seducing man, captures %0a%3c his entire soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, The Zohar says that the evil eye hates and slanders man, and removes %0a%3c him from this world by provoking him to fail to observe the commandment of %0a%3c rejoicing on a holiday (the reception of Ohr Hochma, joy on a higher degree)— so %0a%3c that this joy would not be for the sake of the Creator. It is as though he eats %0a%3c alone and does not share his food with the needy, which leads to the male %0a%3c impure force making a Zivug with Nukva and capturing man's soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c 355 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 356 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 175. The Creator's role is to cheer the poor, according to His ability. For the %0a%3c Creator appears on the holidays so as to look at His broken Kelim. He comes %0a%3c to them, and He sees that there is nothing to rejoice in, and He weeps for %0a%3c them, and ascends Above to destroy the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c To understand this passage and the angels' objections, one must first %0a%3c understand the words of the sages (Midrash Raba, 86): "When creating the world, %0a%3c the Creator asked the angels: 'Shall we create man in our image (T^elem) and %0a%3c likeness?' And the four angels (forces, properties) of creation gave their answers: %0a%3c %0a%3c Mercy said, LET US CREATE, for he creates Hassadim, mercy. Truth %0a%3c said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he is all falsehood. Justice said, LET US %0a%3c CREATE, for he dispenses justice. Peace said, LET US NOT CREATE, for he %0a%3c is all enmity." %0a%3c %0a%3c What did the Creator do? He took truth and concealed it in the ground, as %0a%3c it is written: "cast down truth to the ground" (Daniel, 8: 12). Our entire purpose %0a%3c in the study of the Torah and Mitzvot lies in that, thanks to them, as the Talmud %0a%3c says (Psachim, 50, 2): "From Lo Lishma (intentions for oneself) man comes to %0a%3c Lishma (intentions for the Creator's sake)." %0a%3c %0a%3c And since man is born with such insignificant desires and powers, he is %0a%3c unable to immediately engage in the Creator's Mitzvot for the sake of pleasing %0a%3c the Giver of these Mitzvot, for as it is said: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" (lyov, %0a%3c 11:12). Due to his egoistic nature, he is unable to make any inner movement or %0a%3c action if it is not for his own benefit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator allows man to begin observing the Mitzvot solely for %0a%3c his own sake, seeking personal benefit. Yet, in spite of this, his actions attract %0a%3c spiritual Light to him. And then, with the help of the received Light, he comes %0a%3c to observe the Mitzvot for the Creator's sake, in order to please Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is exactly what Truth presented when it objected to man's creation %0a%3c and said that he is all falsehood. After all, how can man be created to study the %0a%3c Torah and observe Mitzvot in a state of absolute falsehood, i.e., "for oneself?" %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Mercy said, "Let us create," for man performs merciful deeds. %0a%3c Although the Mitzvot of mercy, which man observes (even if mechanically) initially %0a%3c "for his own sake," are mere external actions without the intention of bestowal, %0a%3c with their help he gradually corrects his intentions until he becomes capable of %0a%3c observing all the Mitzvot "for the Creator's sake." Hence, there exists an absolute %0a%3c certainty and guarantee that through his efforts, man will achieve the goal- %0a%3c altruistic actions "for the Creator's sake." And that it is okay to create man. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 357 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Peace also asserted that man is all "enmity;" hence, he can observe the Mitzvot %0a%3c "for the Creator's sake" only if it also brings him personal benefit. However, due %0a%3c to such mixed intentions and actions, man exists in constant conflict with the %0a%3c Creator, for it seems to him that he is great and righteous, and he utterly fails to %0a%3c see his shortcomings. In other words, he is completely unaware that all his work %0a%3c in the Torah and Mitzvot is exclusively for his own benefit. %0a%3c %0a%3c And because he feels this way, he fills up with anger and resentment towards %0a%3c the Creator: why does the Creator not treat him as it befits one so perfectly %0a%3c righteous? It follows that he alternates between states of peace and conflict with %0a%3c the Creator. That is why Peace objected to the creation of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Justice said that man should be created, for he dispenses justice. %0a%3c By observing the Mitzva (singular for Mitzvot) of giving charity to the poor, even %0a%3c with the intention "for oneself," he gradually acquires the property of "bestowal," %0a%3c learns to act "for the Creator's sake," and merits eternal peace with Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Creator heard these opinions, He agreed with the angels of %0a%3c Mercy and Justice, and cast down Truth to the "ground." By this, He allowed %0a%3c man to begin observing the Mitzvot with the intention "for oneself," despite %0a%3c its falsehood. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that the Creator cast Truth down to the ground because He had %0a%3c accepted the claims of Mercy and Justice, that thanks to the Mitzva of giving %0a%3c charity to the poor, man will ultimately come to Truth, i.e., work for the Creator's %0a%3c sake, and Truth will rise from the ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c The only creation created by the Creator is Malchut de Malchut, egoism, %0a%3c and it can only be corrected by "instilling" the Creator's properties of Bina %0a%3c or mercy into it. Yet, if these properties are opposite, how can such a thing be %0a%3c accomplished? After all, in the spiritual world, distance is proportionate to the %0a%3c difference in properties. So how can Malchut be united with Bina? %0a%3c %0a%3c To this end, the Kli was broken: the spiritual, altruistic desire lost its screen %0a%3c and became egoistic. Yet, it retained sparks of the Light, and these sparks exist %0a%3c within egoistic desires. This is why egoistic desires have power over us. %0a%3c %0a%3c These sparks of the Upper Light are the source of various pleasures and love, %0a%3c for Light is pleasure. And since these particles of Light are clothed in impure %0a%3c garments and exist under the rule of the impure forces, man starts perceiving %0a%3c these feelings of love and delight as being inherent in the impure forces, as %0a%3c though these egoistic garments contain pleasures, and such is their property. %0a%3c And he associates the properties of love and pleasure with the impure forces, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 358 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c failing to understand that the impure forces draw him solely with the spiritual %0a%3c spark that has fallen into them. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, as the impure force is very appealing, it lures man into all kinds %0a%3c of transgressions, such as theft, robbery, and murder. At the same time, it gives %0a%3c us the desire to observe the Torah and Mitzvot for our own sake. Even if we start %0a%3c observing them not "for the Creator's sake," but "for ourselves," (for our own %0a%3c benefit, to fulfill our base aspirations, according to the desires of the broken, %0a%3c egoistic JCelim-vessels), we gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's %0a%3c sake," and merit the goal of creation— to receive all the pleasure that was prepared %0a%3c for us back in the Thought of Creation— "to delight man." Thus, the impure %0a%3c forces destroy themselves, but that is exactly the purpose for which the Creator %0a%3c conceived and created them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar says that the Creator appears on these holidays to look at all the %0a%3c broken Kelim. On holidays, when man observes the Mitzva of rejoicing because %0a%3c of the great Light that he receives from the Creator, the Creator appears to look %0a%3c at His broken vessels, by which man is given an opportunity to observe the %0a%3c Mitzvot not "for the Creator's sake." The Creator comes and looks at how well %0a%3c these broken vessels have fulfilled their mission to bring man to observance of %0a%3c the Mitzvot with the intention "for the Creator's sake." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator comes to them and sees that there is nothing to rejoice %0a%3c in. He weeps over them, for He sees that nothing spiritual (altruistic) was created %0a%3c from the broken vessels, that man has yet to correct even a single broken vessel %0a%3c (egoistic desire). In other words, there's not one vessel that was intentionally %0a%3c broken by the Creator that has brought man to the intention "for the Creator's %0a%3c sake," and he rejoices on holidays solely for his own pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the Creator weeps and regrets breaking the vessels, for He broke them %0a%3c and cast Truth to the ground only for man's sake, to give him an opportunity to %0a%3c start working in falsehood (in the intention "for oneself) and gradually come %0a%3c to Truth, to the intention "for the Creator's sake." Yet, when He sees that man %0a%3c has not changed at all in his aspirations for selfish pleasure, it is as though the %0a%3c vessels were broken in vain, and so He weeps for them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And He rises Above, to destroy the world— meaning, He ascends so as to stop %0a%3c the Light's descent and thereby destroy the world. The world and creatures can %0a%3c exist only if they receive the Creator's Light (even if unconsciously). However, %0a%3c if man's state and selfish actions cannot lead him to the intention "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake," the Light itself becomes detrimental to him, for in pursuit of this %0a%3c Light, man sinks ever deeper into egoistic desires (impure forces) and growing %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 359 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c dependency on egoism. Therefore, it is more desirable and beneficial for man %0a%3c to stop feeling pleasure in his impure desires, so that it would not destroy him %0a%3c completely and prevent him from sinking into such powerful egoistic desires %0a%3c that, having become a slave to their pleasures, he would never be able escape %0a%3c them and attain the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c 176. The members of the assembly then appear before the Creator and say: %0a%3c "Master of the world, You are called merciful and forgiving, send Your mercy %0a%3c upon Your sons." He answers them: "Have I not done so, when I created the %0a%3c world based on mercy? As it is written, 'The world is built by mercy' and the %0a%3c world is established upon it. However, if they do not show mercy to the poor, %0a%3c the world will be destroyed." The Heavenly angels then say to Him: "Master %0a%3c of the world, here is a man who had eaten and drunk to his heart's content, %0a%3c and could have been merciful to the poor, but did not do anything." The %0a%3c prosecutor appears, receives permission, and persecutes that man. %0a%3c %0a%3c The exalted souls, called "the members (or the sons) of the assembly" begin %0a%3c praying for the lower ones, so the Creator would have mercy on His sons and %0a%3c not discontinue the flow of Light descending onto them. They do everything %0a%3c within their power to justify man's state of being, and say that as long as he %0a%3c observes his Mitzvot in faith, he is called "the Creator's son," and hence deserves %0a%3c the Creator's mercy, as a son deserves the mercy of his father. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator replies to them that He created the world by the property of %0a%3c mercy, and the world stands on this property alone. In other words, man will %0a%3c not be corrected by the Creator's Light as long as he disdains the poor, for the %0a%3c world's creation was the result of the Creator's agreement with the angel of %0a%3c Mercy, which states that due to man's merciful deeds, the world will be able to %0a%3c exist and will gradually come to the intention "for the Creator's sake." But now, %0a%3c since people are not showing mercy, there will be no correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the Supernal angels said, "Master of the universe, here is a man who %0a%3c had eaten and drunk, and had his fill, and could have been merciful to the poor, %0a%3c but did not give them anything." In this case, the angels begin to accuse man, %0a%3c instead of defending him, even the angels of Mercy and Justice. And all those %0a%3c who did not wish to create an egoistic man with desires "for oneself," but agreed %0a%3c to it only because they assumed that by deeds of mercy and justice he would %0a%3c escape his egoism "for one's own sake" and achieve the altruistic property "for %0a%3c the Creator's sake." Now, they, too, turn against man. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if man is unable to acquire the intention "for the Creator's sake," the %0a%3c angels repent and regret at having agreed to his creation, and they now accuse %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 360 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him before the Creator. And after it becomes clear that man will not achieve the %0a%3c altruistic property "for the Creator's sake" by observing the Mitzvot, he is passed %0a%3c into the hands of the prosecutor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 177. There are none greater in our world than Avraham, who acted with mercy %0a%3c toward all creatures. It is written of the day that he prepared a feast: "The child %0a%3c grew and was weaned, and Avraham made a great feast on the day that Yitzchak %0a%3c was weaned." So Avraham prepared a feast and invited all the leaders of that %0a%3c generation. It is well known that at every feast, the supreme prosecutor is about, %0a%3c watching. And if there are any poor people in the house, he leaves that house %0a%3c and does not return there. However, if the prosecutor enters a house and sees %0a%3c rejoicing without the poor— without having first shown mercy to the poor— he %0a%3c ascends Above and brings accusations against the host of that feast. %0a%3c %0a%3c 178. Because Avraham was the leader of his generation, the prosecutor %0a%3c descended from Heavens and stood at the door of his house, disguised as a %0a%3c poor man. And nobody so much as looked at him. Avraham was attending %0a%3c to kings and ministers, and Sarah was feeding all of their children, for they %0a%3c did not believe that she had born a child, but rather claimed that Yitzchak %0a%3c was a foundling, whom they had bought at the marketplace. This is why they %0a%3c brought their children with them, and Sarah nursed them in front of all. And %0a%3c the prosecutor stands at the door. Sarah said: "The Creator has made laughter %0a%3c for me" ("For anyone who hears will laugh on account of me" (Beresheet, %0a%3c 21:6). The prosecutor ascended at once and stood before the Creator, and said %0a%3c to Him, "O Master of the world, You have said that You love Avraham, and %0a%3c here he had prepared a feast, but had not given anything to You nor to the %0a%3c poor, had not sacrificed even a single pigeon for Your sake. And Sarah says %0a%3c that You have laughed at her." %0a%3c %0a%3c Until the end of correction, it is impossible to fully rid oneself of the impure %0a%3c forces. Hence, however hard even the most exalted righteous may try to observe %0a%3c the Creator's Mitzvot in purity of their altruistic intentions, without any touch %0a%3c of personal benefit, the impure forces can nonetheless accuse them and find %0a%3c faults in their observance of the Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator prepared another opportunity for the righteous to %0a%3c silence the prosecutor— by bribing him with a certain portion of holiness and %0a%3c purity, thus silencing him. This way, the prosecutor is reluctant to accuse a %0a%3c righteous one and does not want him to disappear, for then the prosecutor, %0a%3c too, will be deprived of his part of holiness, the Light that he receives as the %0a%3c righteous one observes each Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 361 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the need for external hair in Tefillin (phylacteries), scapegoat rite, red %0a%3c heifer, and so forth. (The Zohar, Emor, p. 88). From this we see how extraordinary, %0a%3c multifaceted, and complex this world is created, how impossible it is to judge %0a%3c human deeds and the Upper Governance by external manifestations, as they are %0a%3c seen by us, and how "entangled" and inseparably intertwined all the connections %0a%3c between the pure and impure forces really are. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even when we look at our great leaders-Kabbalists, we see how much they've %0a%3c suffered, how they were forced to submit to the will of petty rulers or ignorant %0a%3c masses, and how persecuted they were— those who were closest to the Creator! %0a%3c Everyone feels these obstacles, even those who are just beginning on their %0a%3c spiritual journey. %0a%3c %0a%3c But here, in the example of Avraham, The Zohar does not speak about an %0a%3c ordinary prosecutor, for Avraham had surely given food to all the poor, as he %0a%3c had always done even before he invited his distinguished guests to his table. But %0a%3c this prosecutor demanded his share of holiness, of the Light. However, Avraham %0a%3c did not wish to give anything of holiness to impurity. Rather, he wanted to %0a%3c overcome its power and push it away from himself completely. This is why the %0a%3c prosecutor ascended Above and accused Avraham. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar tells us that the prosecutor was not really poor, but only disguised %0a%3c himself as such, and demanded to be treated at Avraham's festive table. Avraham %0a%3c felt that this was an impure force that assumed the image of a poor man; hence, %0a%3c he refused to give it anything. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written: "He did not sacrifice even a single pigeon," for %0a%3c in accordance to the sacrificial rites (rejection of egoistic parts, of man's "I"), %0a%3c only two pigeons are offered, which symbolize the two combined points in %0a%3c Malchut: the property of Malchut that was corrected by the property of mercy, %0a%3c Bina. This common point contains both the properties of restriction and %0a%3c mercy, but the property of restriction is concealed, whereas the property of %0a%3c mercy is revealed (item 122). %0a%3c %0a%3c Without this combination of Malchut's properties with those of Bina, %0a%3c called the "mitigation" or "sweetening" of Malchut, the world (Malchut) %0a%3c cannot exist, i.e., receive the Creator's Light. Therefore, it is necessary to %0a%3c offer precisely two baby pigeons. One of them was sent by Noah from his %0a%3c Ark, never to return (Beresheet, 8), for one pigeon designates the property of %0a%3c restriction in Malchut that is unmitigated by Bina's property of mercy. And %0a%3c since Noah could not correct anything in her, the pigeon never returned to %0a%3c him (The Zohar Shlach, p. 52). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 362 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The prosecutor's claims and complaints concerning Avraham's feast on the %0a%3c day when Yitzchak was weaned stem from his demand to receive his share, the %0a%3c corrections of the part of Malchut that cannot be corrected until Gmar Tikkun %0a%3c (the end of correction). And this is the property of the restriction within Malchut, %0a%3c with which the world cannot exist; hence, it must be concealed. This property is %0a%3c the pigeon that did not return to Noah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man was not entrusted with the task of correcting his Creator-given %0a%3c primordial egoism, for it is impossible to alter what the Creator had made. %0a%3c However, man can hide his Malchut, his egoism (refrain from using it), and %0a%3c instead act by receiving his desires from Bina. This is why a combination of %0a%3c the properties of Malchut (egoism) and Bina (altruism) was formed in man— to %0a%3c let him make the effort and conceal the properties of Malchut, and act only %0a%3c according to the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c When one is able to completely reject the use of his egoism and is guided %0a%3c only by the properties of Bina, he will achieve a state called "the end of his %0a%3c :tion." Correction is made during the 6,000 years, i.e., along the degre %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, man's Mashiach (Messiah/savior), the Upper Light, comes to him %0a%3c and transforms all of man's egoism (the primordial nature that he was rejecting %0a%3c during the 6,000 years) into altruism. Then, one's egoistic properties serve for %0a%3c the reception of the Light of pleasure for the Creator's sake, and he no longer %0a%3c needs to refrain from using them. %0a%3c %0a%3c The property of Malchut, with which man cannot work for the Creator's %0a%3c sake until his final correction, is referred to as "restriction." Using the properties %0a%3c of Malchut herself remains forbidden until she is completely corrected through %0a%3c gradual purification by the properties of Bina during the 6,000 years. Alternatively, %0a%3c Malchut is called "strictness" or "judgment," for this restriction is also the source %0a%3c of all punishments and prohibitions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham could not correct this property of restriction in Malchut, i.e., %0a%3c receive the Light and fill Malchut entirely. Hence, he received nothing in this %0a%3c part, and that is exactly the way he treated the prosecutor, who ascended at %0a%3c once and began to accuse Avraham before the Creator, claiming that Avraham %0a%3c failed to correct anything in Malchut's property of restriction with his feast. This %0a%3c property of restriction is called "poor," for it does not receive Light; hence, it %0a%3c constitutes the essence of Malchut, her egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Creator mitigated the restrictive property of Malchut with the %0a%3c property of mercy, and mixed Malchut with Bina for the sole purpose of giving the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c He Who Rejoices on Holidays %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 363 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c world an opportunity to exist, the Light that is received thanks to the property %0a%3c of mercy is defined as the part of Light belonging to all the world's inhabitants. %0a%3c This part helps Malchut become corrected. Since the Creator created Malchut in %0a%3c order to personally fill her with Light, she is regarded as His personal part. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of a miracle of nursing the babies that were brought to Sarah, %0a%3c Avraham received all the Light that exists in the property of mercy, and began to %0a%3c doubt his ability to correct the poor part of Malchut. This part receives nothing %0a%3c (for it cannot be used during the 6,000 years) and constitutes the Creator's %0a%3c personal part. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the prosecutor ascended, accusing Avraham of not giving to the %0a%3c poor, i.e., not giving to the part of the Creator, Malchut de Malchut herself, %0a%3c which no man can correct by himself, as even Noah was unable to do so. And %0a%3c he gave nothing to You nor to the poor, and sacrificed not even a single pigeon %0a%3c for Your sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c And Sarah says that You have laughed at her. Sarah is the part of Bina %0a%3c that shines in Malchut. With the words: "Any who hears will laugh on account %0a%3c of me" (Beresheet, 21:6), Sarah-Bina gave Malchut such powerful Ohr Hassadim %0a%3c that Malchut stopped feeling her egoistic desires, felt the perfection of altruism, %0a%3c and temporarily acquired the properties of Bina, while under the influence of %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there emerges fear that due to such a sense of perfection and %0a%3c absence of suffering from unfulfilled desires, the absence of the feeling of %0a%3c deficiency, Malchut would remain uncorrected. Such a state is similar to the %0a%3c following description of Adam's state in the Torah (Beresheet, 3:22): "Lest he %0a%3c put forth his hand, and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever." %0a%3c In other words, he must not stop feeling his own nature nor forget the fact %0a%3c that he is obliged to correct his defect in the "Tree of Knowledge." And that is %0a%3c why Adam was cast down into a place that is suitable for correction, the lowest %0a%3c possible egoistic place, called our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 179. The Creator said to him: "Who in the world is like Avraham?" And the %0a%3c prosecutor did not leave from there until he had consumed the entire fare. So %0a%3c the Creator decreed that Yitzchak is to be sacrificed. And He said that Sarah %0a%3c shall die from grief for her son. The cause of this grief is that he did not give %0a%3c anything to the poor. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak's sacrifice was aimed at the correction of Malchut, to compensate %0a%3c for what Avraham could not correct at his great feast in honor of Yitzchak's %0a%3c weaning. Sarah's death was the result of the great Light that she passed to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 364 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, saying: "The Creator has made laughter for me," alluding to the Light %0a%3c that obstructs the correction of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Light that descends to Malchut and gives her the sensation of %0a%3c perfection prevents her from correcting herself. Hence, the Creator stopped it. %0a%3c This is the significance of Sarah's death, for Sarah constitutes the Light of Bina %0a%3c that enters Malchut. Thus, all that the Torah speaks of is but the essence of the %0a%3c process of Malchut's correction, until her correction is completed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 180. Rabbi Shimon opened and said: "It is written that Hizkiyahu (Hezekiah) %0a%3c turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Creator." Let us see how great %0a%3c and potent the power of the Torah is, and how high it rises above all. He %0a%3c who engages in the Torah has no fear of those Above or below, nor of any %0a%3c hardships or illnesses of this world, for he is connected to the Tree of Life and %0a%3c learns from it each day. %0a%3c %0a%3c 181. For the Torah teaches man how to walk a path of truth; it teaches him %0a%3c how to return to his Master and cancel what is predestined for him. And %0a%3c even if man is shown that what is predestined for him cannot be cancelled, %0a%3c it is nonetheless completely cancelled and annulled, then disappears at once %0a%3c and does not prevail over him in this world. Hence, man should study the %0a%3c Torah day and night, and never abandon it, as it is written: "Contemplate %0a%3c Him day and night." Whomever abandons the Torah, it is as though he %0a%3c abandons the Tree of Life. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Contemplate Him day and night"— "Him" implies the Creator! In another %0a%3c place in The Zohar, it is said that Hizkiyahu's prayer was accepted by the Creator, %0a%3c for nothing (no egoistic desires) separated him from the wall (the Shechina, the %0a%3c sensation of the Creator, akin to the Wailing Wall). %0a%3c %0a%3c This was the advice that he received from the Torah, when, through his %0a%3c efforts in the Torah, he realized how to achieve complete return to the Creator, %0a%3c whereby nothing would separate him from the Creator (from the wall, the %0a%3c Shechina, the sensation of the Creator). As a result, the decree of his death (the %0a%3c Light's exit from the Partzuf) was revoked. So great is the power of the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c 182. Come and see— such is the advice given to man. When he goes to bed at %0a%3c night, he must accept the Creator's governance from Above, and wholeheartedly %0a%3c %0a%3c 365 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 366 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c entrust his soul with Him. Thus, man is immediately spared all the illnesses, %0a%3c slander, and evil eyes, and they will no longer have power over him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we come to a precise understanding of certain definitions from the %0a%3c Torah, which are quite different from the notions that we are accustomed to. %0a%3c Daylight signifies the sensation of unity with the Creator. It is called "Light," for %0a%3c this is how man defines his good feelings. Therefore, daylight is when man feels %0a%3c closeness of the Creator and the greatness of spirituality. %0a%3c %0a%3c Darkness coincides with nighttime in our world. Accordingly, with regard %0a%3c to man's spiritual states, darkness designates the absence of the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator, of the Upper Light, due to the actions of the impure, egoistic forces that %0a%3c separate man from the Creator. At night in our world, we sleep. The spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf is filled with the minimal amount of Light in an unconscious state called %0a%3c "sleep." The amount of Light within the Partzuf is so little that it is defined as %0a%3c one sixtieth— 6 (Sefirot of ZA) x 10 (in each part)— of death or complete absence %0a%3c of spiritual Light, for the impure forces rule here. %0a%3c %0a%3c Due to these two forces that govern and control us, we cannot completely %0a%3c and permanently merge with the Creator. As the result of our sensation of the %0a%3c state of night, the impure forces that rule at night impede us in our efforts, for %0a%3c their power over us keeps returning, thus creating gaps in our unity with the %0a%3c Creator and in our work for His sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct this, Rabbi Shimon gives us his advice: every "night" (a feeling %0a%3c of separation from the spiritual), when man goes to "sleep" (sinks deeper into %0a%3c the sensations of this world), he must wholeheartedly accept the Creator's %0a%3c governance, entrust himself completely under His rule. For if the night (the %0a%3c sensation of night) is corrected as in the act of creation, when day follows night, %0a%3c as it is said, "And there was evening and there was morning, one day," both %0a%3c night and day become as a single whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the night, called "the rule of Malchut," shall not mix with any impure %0a%3c force, and shall not attack man because of the disappearance of the sensation of %0a%3c the Creator on account of egoistic desires and obstacles of "reason." For first, %0a%3c man has realized the necessity of the night for the attainment of the next day %0a%3c (greater sensation of the Creator, a bigger altruistic desire), and perceives these %0a%3c two states as a single whole and as an advancement, despite the fact that in his %0a%3c sensations, a night designates remoteness from spirituality. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the Creator, and is therefore without joy, despite all the possible pleasures, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e language of spiritual work, this means that if man feels remi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for him thi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is called "night." I %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sely %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 367 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c absence of sensation and lack of faith in the Creator that man can, through his %0a%3c own effort, without feeling any taste in the Torah, yield before the Creator's rule. %0a%3c That is, he closes his eyes (as one who goes to sleep) and says: "I bring myself %0a%3c under the Creator's rule and submit to His will." This state is called "descent %0a%3c for the sake of a subsequent ascent," and serves as a springboard, by which man %0a%3c attains an even brighter "day." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, to this end man must completely accept the Supernal Kingdom's %0a%3c rule, so that nothing will separate him from the Creator. In other words, he %0a%3c must submit to the Supernal Rule unconditionally, whether it brings life or %0a%3c death, so that no force in the world will be able to stop him from uniting with %0a%3c the Supernal Ruler, as it is written, "Love your Creator with all your heart, with %0a%3c all your soul and with all your might" (Devarim, 6:5). %0a%3c %0a%3c If man accepts everything that the Creator sends him with all his heart, he %0a%3c is certain that nothing will separate him from the Creator. This determines the %0a%3c fulfillment of the condition of entrusting one's soul with the Creator. For he %0a%3c gives himself into the Creator's hands in advance, by deciding to fulfill all His %0a%3c desires (commandments) to the fullest, right up to self-sacrifice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, as man sleeps, when his soul (the sensation of the Creator), the %0a%3c *ht that previously filled him, leaves his body (desires), he does not feel the %0a%3c th part of death, for the impure (egoistic) forces have no power %0a%3c ;r words, they do not separate him from the Creator. Rather, %0a%3c Is to feel the Creator temporarily. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the impure forces cannot interrupt his spiritual work even in the state %0a%3c called "night," for his evening and morning are already as one day— the Creator's %0a%3c Light. The night becomes a part of the day, for it is precisely because of the night %0a%3c that he recognizes his future merit of receiving an even greater Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because his night stems not from the rule of the impure forces. %0a%3c Instead, he understands that the Creator intentionally sends him such states, %0a%3c hus, even in such sensations as darkness and lack of feeling, absence %0a%3c and taste for the spiritual, he sees an opportunity to merge witl %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 183. And in the morning, when he rises from his bed, he must bless the %0a%3c Creator, enter His house, and bow before Him in fear and trepidation, and %0a%3c only then should he pray. He should take advice of his holy Patriarchs, as it is %0a%3c written, "By Your great mercy shall I come into Your house, to bow in fear of %0a%3c Your holy greatness." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 368 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thanks to Your great kindness, I can now bless You for being merciful to %0a%3c me, for ending my spiritual descent, and for letting me come into Your house %0a%3c once more, for allowing me to feel You. However, I am happy not because my %0a%3c suffering gave way to pleasure, but because now I can thank You. I come to Your %0a%3c house so as to kneel in awe before Your holy greatness, which I now attain more %0a%3c than ever before. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer in our heart is the correction within Malchut (the Shechina, the %0a%3c sensation of the Creator, or the common soul of Israel), and the fulfillment %0a%3c of this common soul with the Upper Light (the sensation of the Creator), in %0a%3c accordance with all of its corrected desires. Hence, all our pleas are expressed %0a%3c in plural form, for we pray not for our own soul, but for the common soul of %0a%3c Israel. Naturally, all that is present in the Shechina is subsequently present in %0a%3c every soul of Israel, and vice versa, all that the common soul of Israel lacks is %0a%3c also absent in each soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, before we start praying, we need to understand (feel) what is %0a%3c lacking in Malchut (the Shechina), to know what we need to correct in her and %0a%3c how we can fulfill her. Our heart, the center of our desires, is a part of this %0a%3c Malchut (the Shechina). All the generations of Israel are included in the common %0a%3c soul— the Shechina. However, we need not correct what has already been corrected %0a%3c by previous generations, but only what is left after those generations of souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our Patriarchs, the spiritual Partzufim called "Avraham, Yitzchakand Yaakov," %0a%3c also known as the Sefirot Hesed, Gevura, and Tifferet of Partzuf ZA de Atzilut, %0a%3c include the entire community of Israel, all the properties that subsequently %0a%3c manifest in the corrected Malchut, who, in her corrected state, is called "Israel." %0a%3c The Patriarchs designate the three spiritual roots of the 600,000 souls of Israel %0a%3c in all the generations. In other words, these are the three sources of desires born %0a%3c within man's part of Malchut for the purpose of his correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the good deeds, the reception and bestowal of Light carried out by %0a%3c the "community of Israel" (by Kabbalists) in all the generations, first trigger %0a%3c reception of the Upper Light by our holy Patriarchs (Sefirot de ZA), for all the %0a%3c Upper Light descends through them from Above downwards. From them, this %0a%3c Upper Light descends onto the "community of Israel," the righteous of that %0a%3c generation who exist with their properties in the worlds of BYA, and evoke the %0a%3c descent of this Light with their prayers. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the order of spiritual degrees: each branch can receive only through %0a%3c its root (the preceding, Higher Degree), but never independently. The main %0a%3c Light remains in the root, and only an insignificant part of it descends to the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 369 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c branch that evokes it. Therefore, all the corrections completed in the community %0a%3c of Israel (the Shechina, the common soul) are stored and preserved in the souls %0a%3c of our holy Patriarchs. %0a%3c %0a%3c (The Light received in the corrected Kelim remains forever within them. %0a%3c Our description of the Light's exit and descent should be understood as a %0a%3c metaphor, for the Partzuf receives new empty desires that require correction, and %0a%3c the sensation of emptiness from the received empty desires is perceived as the %0a%3c Light's departure. Nevertheless, upon correcting these newly received desires, in %0a%3c them the Partzuf will receive an even greater Light than before). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the essence of our prayer lies in supplementing the Shechina with %0a%3c whatever it needs to achieve complete correction, after all the previous corrections %0a%3c that were performed in it by the past generations of Kabbalists. Hence, he who %0a%3c spiritually ascends must first make all the corrections that have already been %0a%3c performed in the Shechina, and only then will he be able to recognize what is left %0a%3c for him to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is written that one cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, %0a%3c but in Hebrew it means "the house of assembly" or "the house of prayer," from %0a%3c the word Kones— "to assemble") before he assembles his prayer and asks the holy %0a%3c Patriarchs for guidance, for he needs to know what has already been corrected %0a%3c and what still needs to be corrected. This is possible only after he receives %0a%3c everything that the Patriarchs have corrected through the Shechina. Only then %0a%3c will he come to know what is left for him to correct in the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Patriarchs have corrected the prayer in the Shechina. Prayer and the %0a%3c Shechina are one and the same, for prayer is a request, a raising of MAN, a Kli, the %0a%3c corrected Malchut or the desire for the Creator's sake. The correction performed %0a%3c by Avraham is called Shacharit (the morning prayer), by Yitzchak— Mincha (the %0a%3c afternoon prayer), and by Yaakov— Arvit (the evening prayer). Therefore, one %0a%3c must first repeat in his prayer everything that was already corrected by them, %0a%3c and then he will discover how to construct his personal plea, and what other %0a%3c imperfections are left that only he can, and consequently, must correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c 184. Man cannot enter the Beit Knesset (synagogue, house of prayer) unless %0a%3c he first receives permission from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, for they %0a%3c have corrected the prayer to the Creator. It is therefore written, "And in Your %0a%3c great mercy shall I enter into Your house" (Tehilim, 5:8). The aforesaid refers %0a%3c to Avraham, for his property is mercy, the Sefira Hesed. "I will bow before %0a%3c Your holy chamber" refers to Yitzchak, for thanks to him Malchut is called %0a%3c Heichal— chamber, the Sefira Qevura. "In fear and trepidation" refers to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 370 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yaakov, for his property is the Sefira Tifferet, called "fear." And man must %0a%3c first enter into these properties, and only then enter the Beit Knesset to raise %0a%3c his prayers. Such a state is described by the verse, "Here is My slave, Israel, by %0a%3c whom I am adorned." %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar analyzes the first three main corrections, made by the %0a%3c Patriarchs in the Shechina. Avraham corrected the property called Bait (house, %0a%3c permanent dwelling), which allows man to merge with it and to always exist in %0a%3c the Creator's properties and sensations, just as he can always dwell in his house. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yitzchak complemented the correction and corrected Maichut in the %0a%3c property called the "holy temple," so that the King Himself would always dwell %0a%3c in it, as a king always dwells in his chambers. Yaakov added to the correction %0a%3c by the property of fear, which corresponds to a gate in front of a house, and %0a%3c designates the condition that (if met) allows man to enter Maichut, Avraham's %0a%3c house, and into Yitzchak's holy temple that are both within her. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon including within him all three corrections of the Patriarchs in full %0a%3c perfection, he attains what has already been corrected in the holy Shechina, and %0a%3c then proceeds to correct what has not been corrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham is the source of the property of mercy in the souls of Israel. %0a%3c Therefore, he corrected the holy Shechina in such a way that it could receive %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim, the Light of Mercy. And the Shechina received this Light in its %0a%3c entirety for all the souls of Israel. Had it remained this way, all the souls of %0a%3c Israel would have been in complete and eternal unity with the Creator, and %0a%3c the Shechina would have been filled with Light (pleasure). Thus, no man would %0a%3c ever wish to part with the Shechina (the sensation of the Creator) even for a %0a%3c single moment. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Avraham's entire correction consisted in the creation of a perfect, %0a%3c bestowing Kli, which consisted only of Ohr Hassadim. There was no way of %0a%3c corrupting its properties or introducing imperfection within it, for, just like %0a%3c Avraham's property of mercy (Hesed), this Kli (desire) consisted only of the will %0a%3c to bestow upon, and please the Creator, as it is written: "Mine is yours and yours %0a%3c is yours designates the property of mercy" (Avot, 85). By imparting creation with %0a%3c his property, Avraham completely separated the impure forces (thoughts and %0a%3c desires) from the Shechina, and made it completely holy and pure. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Thought of Creation does not end here, for it lies in fulfilling %0a%3c the souls with delight. And the extent of pleasure depends on the aspiration to %0a%3c enjoy, on the degree of hunger. Only the extent of preliminary hunger, the will to %0a%3c receive pleasure, determines the extent of the subsequent reception of pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 371 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Shechina (Malchut de Atzilut, the sum of the souls) received its correction %0a%3c from Avraham— the Supernal force of Hassadim, the Sefira Hesed of ZA de Atzilut— %0a%3c and acquired the property of mercy from it. This property is completely free %0a%3c from any selfish will to receive, that is, its desire to receive something from the %0a%3c Creator has completely disappeared, and only the will to bestow upon Him %0a%3c remains. This desire is called "bestowal for the sake of bestowal." However, this %0a%3c brought no correction to the souls (parts of the Shechina), for their role is to %0a%3c receive the pleasure prepared for them by the Creator. To that end, they must %0a%3c first have the "will to receive." After all, pleasure is felt only when preceded by %0a%3c an aspiration or desire for it, and is determined by the extent of this desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence written that Avraham fathered Yitzchak: Yitzchak found the %0a%3c Shechina in absolute spiritual perfection, in the property of pure selfless bestowal, %0a%3c filled with Ohr Hassadim because of all the corrections made by Avraham. %0a%3c However, in accordance with his properties, Yitzchak (the left spiritual force) %0a%3c felt imperfection in this state of the Shechina— that it was not yet corrected to %0a%3c "receive" all that was conceived in the Thought of Creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he corrected it by turning it into a Kli (vessel) of reception, %0a%3c by supplementing it with the will "to receive," so that it could receive all the %0a%3c perfection prepared for it. Yitzchak evoked in the Shechina the will to receive %0a%3c pleasure from the Creator, albeit in the form of "reception for the Creator's %0a%3c sake"— with the intention of receiving pleasure in order to delight Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reception for the Creator's sake means that although man fervently %0a%3c wishes to receive pleasure, he receives not because he wishes to enjoy, but only %0a%3c because the bestowing Creator wishes for him to receive it. And had the Creator %0a%3c not wished it so, man would have no desire to receive from Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Reception for the Creator's sake is equivalent to selfless bestowal. Thus, the %0a%3c egoistic, impure force, cannot cling to such a desire. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Yitzchak corrected the Shechina and brought it to complete perfection, %0a%3c for now it can receive all that the Creator conceived to bestow upon it, as this is %0a%3c the purpose of His creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, after being corrected by Yitzchak, the state of Malchut-Shechina is %0a%3c called Heichal (the Creator's chambers), for now He can fill it with Himself, His %0a%3c Light, which means that He dwells in its halls. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Avraham's correction, called "house," did not yet allow the Shechina to %0a%3c be filled and worthy of the Creator's presence. Hence, Yitzchak is considered %0a%3c to have corrected all the Gevurot (willpower and resistance to egoism in the %0a%3c souls of Israel). This means that he mitigated all the laws and restrictions in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 372 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator's governance. This is because all restrictions and punishments come into %0a%3c this world for the sole purpose of correcting the souls' will to receive, to make %0a%3c them suitable for reception of the infinite goodness contained in the Thought %0a%3c of Creation. And since Yitzchak corrected the Shechina to complete perfection, %0a%3c all its restrictions and forces have been corrected, and all of its properties have %0a%3c attained the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, his correction, too, did not retain this form in the Shechina, and %0a%3c became corrupted, for the world was still unprepared for the end of correction. %0a%3c Hence, Yitzchak fathered a sinner, Esav, who, being unable to resist the temptation %0a%3c to receive for himself, corrupted Yitzchak's correction in the Shechina. Unlike %0a%3c Yitzchak, he could not resist the selfish reception. This means that even when it %0a%3c became clear to him that the bestowing Creator did not wish for him to receive, %0a%3c he wanted to receive nonetheless, for such was his desire of self-gratification. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the impure force (Klipot-shells, the husk, or rind surrounding %0a%3c the pure forces) clung to the Shechina. Thus, the legs (Sefirot NHYM) of Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut de Atzilut descended to the place of the Klipot below Parsa, where egoistic %0a%3c desires dominate the desires of NHYM. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Rosh and the Upper Part of the Guf down to the Tabur of Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut remained above the rule of the impure forces. Hence, his head (Rosh) %0a%3c understands how he should act (hence, Yitzchak's head is buried together with %0a%3c the bodies of Avraham and Yaakov in the Machpela cave), but the body (Guf) still %0a%3c wants to receive pleasure for its own sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Yaakov saw the damage caused by Esav, he corrected the Shechina %0a%3c by adding his property of fear to it, as it is written: "His hand had hold on Esav's %0a%3c heel" (The Torah, Beresheet, 25:26). Because Yaakov realized what imperfection %0a%3c Esav had caused in Shechina (in the created souls), he corrected himself in fear %0a%3c to such an extent that he raised the holy Shechina as a crown-adornment. By this %0a%3c he also retained the corrections made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Yaakov's correction was not final, for this fear is more similar to %0a%3c the fear of transgression than the selfless fear that comes from within. For this %0a%3c fear of his is born in him from Esav's hip, even though he had not transgressed %0a%3c by receiving, as did Esav. But the end of correction will bring a different state: %0a%3c Esav's hip will be annulled, as it is written: "Death will forever vanish from the %0a%3c world," and fear will remain only because the Creator is almighty and great. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yaakov attained this genuine fear by himself. However, the entire "community %0a%3c of Israel," all the souls that form the Shechina, still need to correct themselves %0a%3c in all the generations, from the first to the last, to the end of correction. (Only %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Torah and Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 373 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Moshe attained the property of true fear— one out of greatness and love— only %0a%3c he, and no one else. Hence, as the Talmud says, description of fear out of love %0a%3c for the Creator doesn't even exist.) %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar cites the words of the Psalm (5:8): "By Your great mercy I shall %0a%3c come into Your house," since Avraham corrected the Shechina up to the property %0a%3c of a "house" that is filled with goodness, i.e., with Ohr Hassadim. The words, %0a%3c "So as to bow before Your holy chamber," refer to Yitzchak, who corrected the %0a%3c Shechina from a "house" to a "chamber" that befits the Creator. The words, %0a%3c "in fear" refer to Yaakov, who corrected the Shechina with his property of fear, %0a%3c whereupon he made it a Kli (vessel) of reception that includes all the corrections %0a%3c made by Avraham and Yitzchak. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how did he find out what else needed correction in the Shechina! Only %0a%3c by correcting and including himself in these three corrections performed by the %0a%3c holy Patriarchs before him. This means that, just as they did, Yaakov can act %0a%3c according to the conditions of these corrections. In other words, Yaakov merged %0a%3c with their properties, thereby ascending to their level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, man must first attain these properties and correct them within him. %0a%3c Only after he assumes the properties of these three corrections into himself can %0a%3c he start correcting them from where our Patriarch Yaakov left off, i.e., elevating %0a%3c fear to the extent of the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, and drawing the %0a%3c Upper Light with his prayer, with his awe of the Creator's greatness. And the %0a%3c Upper Light will bring with it the fulfillment of the Shechina and the end of %0a%3c its correction. Hence, man's prayer must include two objectives: to obtain fear %0a%3c of the Creator's true greatness, and with this attainment, to achieve the final %0a%3c correction of his egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 185. Rabbi Pinchas stood before Rabbi Rachuma on the shore of Lake %0a%3c Kinneret. He was wise, old, and almost blind. He said to Rabbi Pinchas: "1 %0a%3c have heard that our friend Shimon Bar-Yochai has a jewel, a son. I have looked %0a%3c upon the Light from that jewel, and it shines like the light of the sun, and %0a%3c illuminates the entire world." %0a%3c %0a%3c A fully corrected Malchut is called a jewel (usually a pearl). Rabbi Nachum %0a%3c tells Rabbi Pinchas that Rabbi Shimon has already merited complete correction, %0a%3c for a "son" designates the next state, the next Partzuf that emerges or is born %0a%3c from the preceding one. And Rabbi Pinchas sees this while looking (with his %0a%3c spiritual sight, called Ruach HaKodesh—the Holy Spirit) at the Light of this pearl, %0a%3c which shines like the sun emerging from its hiding (Nartik— sheath). This means %0a%3c that after the future correction of Malchut (the moon), her Light will become %0a%3c like that of the sun, and will illuminate the entire world. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the Light of the moon becomes like that of the sun, it will rise to %0a%3c the zenith and illuminate the whole world with a pillar of Light, from Heaven %0a%3c to earth. And it will shine until Rabbi Shimon completes the correction of Ati/c. %0a%3c This speaks to the fact that he has already merited attaining the degrees of the %0a%3c Creator's two revelations, i.e., the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 186. And that Light extends from the Heavens down to the earth and %0a%3c illuminates the whole world until Atik-Keter appears and sits upon its throne, %0a%3c which occurs at the end of correction. And that Light abides entirely in your %0a%3c household (for the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was wife to Rabbi Shimon, and %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar was therefore his grandson). And a tiny ray of Light (called "the %0a%3c son of the household," Rabbi Elazar) separates from the Light that fills the %0a%3c household, comes forth and shines upon the whole world. Happy are those %0a%3c %0a%3c 375 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 376 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c who merit such a destiny! Come out, my son, come out! Go after that jewel, %0a%3c which illuminates the world, for it is a good time to do so! %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the daughter of Rabbi Pinchas was the wife of Rabbi Shimon (Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon and his wife designate two spiritual Partzufim that are below Rabbi %0a%3c Pinchas), Rabbi Shimon (together with his wife) belonged to the household %0a%3c (was included in the Partzuf) of Rabbi Pinchas. This refers to Rabbi Elazar, the %0a%3c Partzuf that emerged from the Light and illuminated the world, which filled %0a%3c the household (ten Sefirot) of Rabbi Pinchas, i.e., came out of the Partzuf called %0a%3c "Rabbi Shimon and his wife." %0a%3c %0a%3c 187. He came out before him and stood waiting to board a ship. Two women %0a%3c were with him. He saw two birds soaring over the water. He raised his voice %0a%3c and said, "Birds, you soar over the sea; have you seen the place where one %0a%3c could find Bar-Yochai?" He waited some and said, "Birds, O birds, fly away." %0a%3c They flew away and disappeared into the sea. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon fled from the authorities that condemned him to death, and %0a%3c hid in a cave with his son. And no one knew where he was. Therefore, Rabbi %0a%3c Pinchas set out to look for him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although everything described here is historically true, it is nonetheless %0a%3c essential for us to understand the words of The Zohar as the actions of Supernal %0a%3c spiritual causes, whose consequences determine all that transpires on earth. %0a%3c The egoistic authorities (forces) of a Partzuf as exalted as Rabbi Shimon's try %0a%3c to overcome his own altruistic aspirations and deprive him of the Light, that %0a%3c is, to kill him. And he hides from them in a cave, i.e., assumes a small state %0a%3c (Katnut) and shines with the Light of Mercy. This is referred to as "hides in %0a%3c a cave"— becomes invisible to egoistic forces, for they desire Ohr Hochma and %0a%3c cannot see Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 188. Before he boarded the ship, the birds approached again, and in the beak %0a%3c of one of them was a letter. It read that Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, had %0a%3c left the cave together with his son, Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Pinchas went to them %0a%3c and found them completely changed: their bodies were covered with sores %0a%3c (like holes in the ground— see the Talmud, Bava Batra, 19:2) from staying in %0a%3c the cave for so long. He wept and said, "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon replied: "O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had %0a%3c you not seen me so, I would not have been what I am!" Rabbi Shimon opened %0a%3c about the Mitzvot of the Torah and said, "The Mitzvot of the Torah that the %0a%3c Creator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon's Departure from the Cave %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 377 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c While staying in the cave (in Ohr Hassadim) for many years (degrees), Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon had no choice but to sit in the sand (the external garment— Levush %0a%3c covering the Partzuf with a particular property, called "earth") in order to cover %0a%3c his naked body (desires) so he could study the Torah (receive the Upper Light in %0a%3c his Partzuf with the intention for the Creator's sake). As a result of being covered %0a%3c with sand, his entire "body" was covered with "rust and sores" (but these were %0a%3c necessary corrections). %0a%3c %0a%3c And not only did the Partzuf called Rabbi Shimon need the correction of %0a%3c concealment in Hassadim (cave) and the cover of an external garment (Returning %0a%3c Light), but his next state, fathered by him, called his son, Rabbi Elazar (a lower %0a%3c Partzuf), also needed these corrections to attain all of the Creator's Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c He wept and said: "Woe that I have seen you so!" Rabbi Shimon replied: %0a%3c "O how happy is my lot that you have seen me so, for had you not seen me so, %0a%3c I would not have been what I am!" In other words, if I would not look as I do, I %0a%3c would not have merited all the secrets of the Torah, for all that I have attained, %0a%3c I have attained during those thirteen years (thirteen successive corrections) of %0a%3c hiding in the cave. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon opened. It is written of the Mitzvot of the Torah: "The Mit^ot %0a%3c of the Torah that the Creator gave to Israel are all described in a general form." %0a%3c All of the Mitzvot of the Torah are described in the passage from the Torah, %0a%3c starting with "In the beginning the Creator created" and ending with "Let there %0a%3c be Light." These are the Mitzvot of fear and punishment, which include all the %0a%3c Mitzvot of the Torah. This is why they are called "in general." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 189. BERESHEET BARAH ELOKIM (In the beginning the Creator created) %0a%3c is the first Mitzva (commandment), the root and foundation of everything. %0a%3c And it is called "fear of the Creator" or Resheet (beginning), as it is written: %0a%3c "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom." Fear of the Creator is the %0a%3c beginning of wisdom, for this fear is called "the beginning." And it is the gate %0a%3c that leads to faith. And the whole world is based on this Mitzva. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is difficult to understand why fear is called "the beginning," and why it %0a%3c precedes wisdom and faith. The Zohar answers: it is because fear is the beginning %0a%3c of every Sefira, and it is impossible to attain any Sefira (property) without first %0a%3c attaining the property of fear. Yet, this implies that fear is merely a means of %0a%3c attaining other qualities or properties. But then, if it is only a means, then why %0a%3c is it included in the list of Mitzvot (plural for Mitzva) as the first Mitzva 7 . Can it %0a%3c be that fear is a kind of prerequisite? %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar says that it is impossible to attain perfect, selfless faith %0a%3c in any way other than through fear of the Creator. And the extent of fear will %0a%3c determine the extent of faith. Hence, the whole world is based on the Mitzva %0a%3c of fear, for the whole world exists only thanks to the Torah and Mitzvot, as %0a%3c the prophet said: "If not for My union with day and night, I would not have %0a%3c appointed the ordinances of Heaven and earth" (Yirmiyahu, 33:25). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since fear is the beginning and the gate to the other Mitzvot (for fear %0a%3c is also the gate to faith), the whole world is based on this property of fear. It %0a%3c is hence written that the Mitzva of fear includes all of the other Mitzvot of the %0a%3c Torah; and were it not for fear, the Creator would not have created anything. %0a%3c %0a%3c 190. There are three types of fear, two of which have no real basis, but one %0a%3c does. If man fears that his children may die, or fears illness or bodily suffering, %0a%3c or fears for his material well-being, this kind of fear (even if constant) is not %0a%3c the basis or root, for only desirable consequences constitute the cause of fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 379 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 380 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is called "the fear of punishment in this world." But there is also another %0a%3c type of fear: the fear of punishment in the world to come, in hell. These %0a%3c two types of fear— the fear of punishment in this world and in the world to %0a%3c come— do not constitute real basis and root. %0a%3c %0a%3c 191. The real fear is the fear of the Creator, for He is great and almighty, for %0a%3c He is the Source of everything, and all else is nothing compared to Him. Man %0a%3c should concentrate all his attention on attaining this kind of fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three kinds of fear before the Creator, but only one of them is %0a%3c considered true fear. If one is afraid of the Creator, and observes His Mitzvot so %0a%3c he and his children will be well and prosperous, this constitutes the first kind, %0a%3c the fear of the various punishments in this world. If he observes the Create %0a%3c Mitzvot because he fears punishments in hell, this is the second kind of fea %0a%3c Zohar says that neither of these two kinds is true, for man observes the Mitz %0a%3c only out of fear of punishment, for the sake of his own benefit, and not beca %0a%3c these are the Creator's Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this case, his personal wellbeing is the cause of his observance, and his %0a%3c r is merely a consequence of his will to receive pleasure. Rather, true fear %0a%3c t stem from the Creator's greatness and omnipotence, for He rules %0a%3c e source of everything. All the worlds emerge from Him, and His %0a%3c testify to His greatness. And all that He created is nothing compared tc %0a%3c for it adds nothing to Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we can plainly see that there is no difference in action: one observes %0a%3c out of the first or second kinds of fear, while the other observes out of the third %0a%3c kind. To an onlooker, they perform the same actions, the Creator's Mitzvot. %0a%3c the enormous difference between them lies only in their intention, %0a%3c y they observe the Creator's decree! %0a%3c %0a%3c possible to discern man's spiritual degree by his %0a%3c itzvot, which is visible to all. Moreover, those who %0a%3c them in order to receive an immediate reward from others usually do so with %0a%3c the utmost outward zeal. But one whose intentions and thoughts are directed %0a%3c inwardly, who seeks true observance, as a rule, does not stand out amidst the %0a%3c masses in any way. %0a%3c %0a%3c One must constantly seek to perfect and complement his intentions only %0a%3c by observing the Mitzvot at an increasingly deeper level, while focusing on inner %0a%3c contemplation and direction of his thoughts. In no way should he engage in %0a%3c excessive "mechanical observance," on which there is a clear prohibition: "Do %0a%3c not exaggerate in the Mitzvot." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 381 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c On the contrary, one must devote all his attention to the attainment of true %0a%3c fear, as the Creator's first Mitzva decrees. As Rabbi Baruch Ashlag said, "Fear %0a%3c of the Creator is the constant, selfless desire that is expressed in the thought: %0a%3c 'Have I done everything I could for the Creator, or is there anything more that %0a%3c I can do for Him?'" %0a%3c %0a%3c 192. Rabbi Shimon started to weep, wailing, "Woe if 1 reveal and woe %0a%3c if I do not reveal. If 1 say, the sinners will know how to work for the %0a%3c Creator's sake, and if 1 do not say, it will not reach my friends." Wherever %0a%3c there is true fear, opposite it and correspondingly below stands an evil fear, %0a%3c which strikes and prosecutes. It is the scourge that whips the sinners %0a%3c (punishing them for their sins). This is why he is afraid to reveal it, for the %0a%3c sinners may learn how to avoid punishment, and punishment constitutes %0a%3c their correction! %0a%3c %0a%3c Here Rabbi Shimon warns that he cannot reveal everything in its entirety %0a%3c (this refers to Avoda Lishma— work "for the Creator's sake"), for he fears it may %0a%3c harm the sinners. Here he wishes to reveal how one can draw nearer and merge %0a%3c with the Tree of Life, and therewith refrain from touching the Tree of Death. %0a%3c However, this refers only to those who have already corrected themselves with %0a%3c regard to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, the sinners (those who have yet to correct their transgressions %0a%3c in the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) are not entitled to know this, for %0a%3c they still need to toil in all the required tasks until they correct themselves in %0a%3c the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus we see that the Torah defines a %0a%3c sinner as one who is yet to correct the Tree of Knowledge in his soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prohibition on revealing the true essence of the work for the Creator's %0a%3c sake is based on the words of the Torah: "Behold, Adam has become as one of %0a%3c us in knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take %0a%3c also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever" {Be.re.she.et, 3:22). %0a%3c %0a%3c After Adam's sin in the Tree of Knowledge, the Creator banished him %0a%3c from the Garden of Eden to prevent Adam from connecting to the Tree of Life %0a%3c and gaining eternal life. This is because then, what he corrupted in the Tree %0a%3c of Knowledge would remain uncorrected. Therefore, to let only the righteous %0a%3c know this wisdom, Rabbi Shimon reveals it by way of allusion. %0a%3c %0a%3c 193. But he who fears the punishment by whippings, the true fear of the %0a%3c Creator cannot descend upon him. Instead, evil fear overtakes him in the %0a%3c form of fearing punishment by whipping. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 382 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 194. Therefore, the place that is named "fear of the Creator" is called the %0a%3c beginning of knowledge. This is why this Mitzva is included here. And it is %0a%3c the foundation and source of all the other Mitzvot of the Torah. And whoever %0a%3c observes the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, thereby observes all the others. But %0a%3c he who does not observe the Mitzva of fear of the Creator, does not observe %0a%3c the other Mitzvot of the Torah, for this Mitzva constitutes the foundation for %0a%3c all the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar repeats that in one place it is written, "Fear of the Creator %0a%3c is the beginning of wisdom," while in another it says, "Fear of the Creator is the %0a%3c beginning of knowledge." And The Zohar explains that where the property of %0a%3c fear ends, another evil fear begins, one that slanders and whips. In this regard, %0a%3c it is said in Kabbalah that the legs of a pure Partzuf Malchut descend to a place %0a%3c of impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, he who observes the Mitzva of fear because the Creator is great %0a%3c and almighty unites with Him (becomes equal to the Creator in his properties), %0a%3c so as to not feel shame in receiving from Him. Besides this correction, no other %0a%3c work exists for the creatures. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is called "fear of the Creator for the sake of life," for as a result of %0a%3c merging with the Creator, creatures are filled with life. Otherwise, they fall %0a%3c under the power of the restriction, as Tzimtzum Aleph (first restriction) restricted %0a%3c the reception of Light in egoistic desires. Such a Kli (desire) becomes a cause %0a%3c of death, for it is an empty place (devoid of Light). Hence, creatures must fear %0a%3c failing to make the corrections that they were entrusted with. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, those who observe the Mitzvot out of fear, rather than out of %0a%3c realization of the Creator's greatness and His decree, are ruled and whipped by %0a%3c the fear of an empty Malchut. And since the end of fear lies in the evil scourge, %0a%3c true fear is called "The beginning of knowledge of the fear of the Creator," %0a%3c which indicates the necessity to aspire only to this kind of fear, and beware of %0a%3c the evil kind. Because of this, Adam's sin is corrected. %0a%3c %0a%3c 195. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (signifying fear) THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. For whoever %0a%3c transgresses here, transgresses all of the Torah Mitzvot. And his punishment %0a%3c is the evil scourge, i.e., the evil fear that whips him. The words, AND THE %0a%3c EARTH WAS UNFORMED AND CHAOTIC, AND DARKNESS WAS %0a%3c UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP, AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR %0a%3c refer to the four punishments of the wicked. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 383 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 196. WITHOUT FORM refers to strangulation. CHAOTIC refers to stoning, %0a%3c i.e., the stones that fall into the great deep to punish the sinners. DARKNESS %0a%3c signifies burning, the fire that falls upon the heads of the wicked to burn %0a%3c them down. THE SPIRIT OF THE CREATOR refers to beheading. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those who observe the Mitzva of fear before the Creator not because such is %0a%3c His decree, but because they are afraid of punishment, fall into the impure force's %0a%3c trap, called "without form." As a result, they are lost, having no understanding %0a%3c of the Creator's thoughts and deeds. And this impure force is defined as a rope %0a%3c on man's neck, blocking the inflow of pure (holy) air to his soul and preventing %0a%3c him from gaining life. And to the extent of man's ignorance, the impure force %0a%3c strangulates him! %0a%3c %0a%3c And when he is caught in the impure force's noose, tightening around his %0a%3c neck, it has the power to control man at its will: to stone, burn, or behead him. %0a%3c Stoning means that impure thoughts befall his head with desired pleasures, %0a%3c thus pulling him down into the deep. There they punish him with darkness %0a%3c (burning), and the impure force turns him on fierce fire until it burns all the %0a%3c pure life-force out of him. %0a%3c %0a%3c 197. The spirit of the Creator means beheading, for the scorching wind %0a%3c (Ruach Se'ara) is a flaming sword— punishment for whoever does not observe %0a%3c the Torah and Mitzvot that are mentioned after the Mitzva of fear, called %0a%3c "foundation," as it includes all the Mitzvot. This is because after the word %0a%3c BERESHEET (BEGINNING), which signifies fear, it is written WITHOUT %0a%3c FORM, CHAOS, DARKNESS and SPIRIT-in all, the four penalties of death. %0a%3c And then follow the rest of the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Following the first sentence of the Torah, the remaining part of the Torah %0a%3c refers to the rest of the Mitzvot, which are particular with regard to the general %0a%3c and all-inclusive Mitzva of fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 198. The second Mit^va (commandment) is inseparably connected with the %0a%3c TAitzva of fear, and it is the M.itzva of love— for man to love his Creator with %0a%3c perfect love. What is perfect love? It is a great love, as it is written, "He walks %0a%3c before the Creator in complete sincerity and perfection" (Beresheet, 17:1), %0a%3c which signifies perfection in love. Thus, it is written, "And the Creator said, %0a%3c 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3)— this is perfect love, called "great love." %0a%3c This is precisely how man should love his Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c There exists conditional love, which appears as a result of all the goodness %0a%3c received from the Creator ("Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot," items %0a%3c 66-74), as a result of which man merges with the Creator with all his heart and %0a%3c soul. Yet, although he merges with the Creator in complete perfection, this %0a%3c love is considered imperfect. It is similar to Noah's love (Beresheet Raba, 30), %0a%3c who constantly needed to reinforce his feeling— to see that the Creator sends %0a%3c him only goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Avraham, however, needed nothing to reinforce his love for the Creator, %0a%3c as it is written: "He walks before the Creator in complete perfection." For the %0a%3c words "walks before" mean that he needs nothing to reinforce his feeling of love %0a%3c for the Creator. And even if he does not receive anything from Him, his love %0a%3c remains constant and perfect, and he wishes to merge with the Creator with his %0a%3c heart and soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c 199. Rabbi Elazar said, "I have heard what perfect love means." He was told, %0a%3c "Tell this to Rabbi Pinchas, as he truly exists on that degree." Rabbi Elazar %0a%3c said, "Perfect love means that it is perfect on both sides; if it does not include %0a%3c both sides, such a love is imperfect." %0a%3c %0a%3c He was told to turn to Rabbi Pinchas, for Rabbi Pinchas had already %0a%3c attained the degree of perfect love and will be able understand him correctly. %0a%3c %0a%3c 385 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 386 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The words "on both sides" refer to both the good side and the evil side. In other %0a%3c words, if the Creator gives him not only goodness, but restrictions, too (which %0a%3c he perceives as unpleasant), and even if He takes his soul away, still man's love %0a%3c for the Creator remains perfect, as though he receives from Him nothing but %0a%3c the very best in the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 200. Therefore, there is he who loves the Creator in order to gain riches, %0a%3c live a long life, have many healthy children, and rule over his enemies— he %0a%3c receives everything he wants, and this is why he loves the Creator. However, %0a%3c should he receive the opposite, should the Creator lead him through a wheel %0a%3c of suffering, he will come to hate the Creator, and will feel no love toward %0a%3c Him whatsoever. Therefore, such a love is baseless. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since his love depends on what he receives from the Creator, when %0a%3c reception stops, so does his love. Clearly, man can love only one or the other— %0a%3c himself or the Creator! %0a%3c %0a%3c 201. Love is considered perfect if it exists on both sides— on the side of judgment %0a%3c and the side of mercy (success in life). As we already mentioned, when one %0a%3c loves the Creator, even if He were to take away his soul, this love would remain %0a%3c perfect on both sides: mercy and judgment. Therefore, the Light of the %0a%3c First Act of Creation was revealed and then concealed. And because of this %0a%3c concealment, strict judgment appeared in the world, and both sides, mercy %0a%3c and judgment, united to form perfection. And this is the desired love. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that was created on the first day of creation (in the verse "Let there %0a%3c be Light") was later concealed, as it is written, for the righteous in the world to %0a%3c come. It was concealed so as to let strict judgment appear in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c This leads to the unification of the two sides (mercy and judgment) into one, %0a%3c for man receives an opportunity to reveal the perfection of love even when the %0a%3c Creator takes his soul away, and he is given an opportunity to supplement and %0a%3c perfect his love. And had the Light not been concealed, strict judgment would %0a%3c not have been revealed, and the GREAT LOVE would have been concealed %0a%3c from the righteous, and there would be no way of revealing it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 202. Rabbi Shimon kissed him. Rabbi Pinchas approached, kissed and blessed %0a%3c him. He said, "It is clear that the Creator has sent me here. This is the tiny %0a%3c ray of Light that was said to be shining in my house, and would later light up %0a%3c the whole world" (item 186). Rabbi Elazar said that fear must certainly not be %0a%3c forgotten from all the Mitzvot; especially in this Mitzva, the Mitzva of love, %0a%3c fear must be attached to this Mitzva at all times. How is it attached? Love is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 387 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c good when it brings goodness, health, sustenance, and life from the Beloved %0a%3c One. And it is here that fear of sinning must be revived, so that the wheel does %0a%3c not turn against him, as it is written, "Happy is the man who always fears," %0a%3c for his fear is contained in his love. %0a%3c %0a%3c 203. This is how fear should be evoked from the perspective of strict judgment, %0a%3c for once man realizes that strict judgment hovers over him, he must evoke %0a%3c within him fear of his Master. Thus, his heart will not be hardened, of which %0a%3c it is written, "He that hardens his heart shall fall into evil," into the other %0a%3c side. This is called evil. Therefore, fear unites with both sides— with goodness %0a%3c and love, as well as with strict judgment, and consists of both. And if fear is %0a%3c united with the good side and love, as well as with the strictness of judgment, %0a%3c such a love is perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mitzva of fear includes all the Mitzvot of the Torah; it is the gateway to %0a%3c faith in the Creator— to the extent of his fear, man acquires faith in the Creator's %0a%3c governance. Hence, he must not forget fear in observing every Mitzva, especially %0a%3c the Mitzva of love, at which time fear needs to be roused even more, for fear %0a%3c must constantly be present in the Mitzva of love. Therefore, man must evoke %0a%3c fear within him in the two states of love: in love from the good side, when he %0a%3c receives good sensations from the Creator, and in love from the evil side, when %0a%3c the Creator sends him harsh restrictions, according to judgment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, it would be incorrect to think that perfect love means a state %0a%3c where one receives bad feelings from the Creator, to the extent of feeling one's %0a%3c soul being taken away. It is incorrect to think that one should not fear the %0a%3c Creator's judgment and strictness, and, despite his feelings to cling unto Him %0a%3c with love, fearlessly and wholeheartedly. %0a%3c %0a%3c First, one must rouse fear within him lest his love for the Creator will %0a%3c weaken. Thus, he combines love and fear. Second, from the other side of love, %0a%3c from the side of feeling the strictness, he must rouse within him fear before %0a%3c the Creator, and not let his heart harden, so it would not stop heeding the %0a%3c unpleasant sensations of punishment. Thus, here, too, he includes fear and %0a%3c love, and if he acts so in both sides of love, his love remains forever connected %0a%3c to fear, thus becoming perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written about the good side's inclusion of fear into love: "Happy is %0a%3c the man who always fears." The word "always" indicates that although man %0a%3c always receives only goodness from the Creator, he fears Him nonetheless, for %0a%3c he fears that he may sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 388 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is written about the evil side's inclusion of fear into love, when man %0a%3c feels punishments and strictness of judgment: "He who lets his heart be hardened %0a%3c shall fall into awe." This means that one should in no way and under no circum- %0a%3c stances let his heart be hardened under the judgment's influence. Otherwise, he %0a%3c will fall into the impure forces, called "evil." In such a case, he must rouse within %0a%3c him even more fear of the Creator, and mingle his fear into the love. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, neither kind is fear for oneself, for one's own well-being. Rather, %0a%3c they both refer to man's fear of diminishing his intentions and actions for the %0a%3c Creator's sake, and his attempts to direct them all towards pleasing Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we have clarified the first two Mitzvot of the Torah— the Mitzvot of fear %0a%3c and love. The Mitzva of fear is the basis for all the other Mitzvot and of the entire %0a%3c Torah. It is contained in the first word of the Torah, BERESHEET (IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING), and in its first sentence, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. Fear is called BEGINNING, %0a%3c from which THE HEAVENS and THE EARTH are born, meaning ZON and %0a%3c their descendants, the worlds of BYA. And the second sentence in the Torah %0a%3c refers to punishment in the form of four kinds of spiritual death: WITHOUT %0a%3c FORM means strangulation, CHAOTIC means stoning, DARKNESS means %0a%3c burning, and SPIRIT means beheading. The Mitzva of love is described in the %0a%3c Torah in the verse: AND THE CREATOR SAID, 'LET THERE BE LIGHT' %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sides to this Mitzva, which are called "kindness and longevity" %0a%3c and "with all one's soul." This implies that man should feel love even under the %0a%3c worst kinds of circumstances, i.e., when the Creator takes his soul away, just as %0a%3c he feels it when everything is well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just to reveal this perfect love, the Light of creation was concealed. Fear must %0a%3c also be included in both sides of love: in the part where man must fear to commit %0a%3c a sin, thereby reducing his love for the Creator, and in the part where he must fear %0a%3c because of the concealment and the Creator's judgment. Yet, to understand these %0a%3c spiritual categories, we must clarify them in a slightly different manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c Calls for love are used repeatedly in the Torah: "Love thy neighbor...," "Do %0a%3c not do what you hate to another," and so on. But the basis of all this is love %0a%3c between man and the Creator; this is where our requests are directed: "Draw us %0a%3c nearer with love...," "He who chooses Israel with love..." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 389 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c We can take as an example the natural love between father and son. Parents %0a%3c naturally love their only son more than anything in the world. Accordingly, the %0a%3c son should hold the same kind of love for his parents. Yet, we see that this is not %0a%3c so: if the son feels unconditional love from his parents, then, in accordance with %0a%3c nature's law and regardless of himself, his love for them will decrease. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because the father's love for his son is natural; and just as the %0a%3c father wants his son to love him, his son wants to be loved by his father. This %0a%3c reciprocal desire gives rise to fear in both their hearts: the father is afraid that %0a%3c the son may hate him (even a little), and the son fears the same. %0a%3c %0a%3c This constant fear begets good deeds between them: each of them aspires %0a%3c to show his love to the other, so as to promote reciprocity. Yet, when their love %0a%3c reaches peaks, and there is nothing else that can be added to it, the beloved son %0a%3c discovers absolute and unconditional love in the heart of his loving father. %0a%3c %0a%3c The loved one immediately stops fearing that he will be loved less; neither %0a%3c can he hope that the love for him will grow. And this leads to a situation where %0a%3c the son grows lazy and stops expressing his love with good deeds. And as they %0a%3c lessen, his love lessens, too, until it is reversed into its opposite— hatred, for he %0a%3c deems everything his father does as worthless and insufficient in comparison %0a%3c with what the father's actions out of "absolute" love should be. Therefore, the %0a%3c union of love and fear within man brings him to the state of perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four letters HaVaYaH (Yod + Hey + Vav + Hey) correspond to Sefirot %0a%3c H-B-ZA-M. The Zohar calls them, FEAR, LOVE, TORAH, COMMAND- %0a%3c MENT, respectively. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YOD - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - HOCHMA - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c FEAR %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEY - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - BINA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LOVE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c VAV - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TORAH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEY - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - MALCHUT - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c COMMANDMENT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf AA is the main Partzuf, and includes the entire world of Atzilut It %0a%3c shines upon all the other worlds through its garments, called AVI, YESHSL7T and %0a%3c ZON, where AVI and YESHSUT clothe AA from its Peh to Tabur, while ZON %0a%3c clothe AA from Tabur down to its Slum Raglairn (end of legs) that stand on Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c AA is called "the concealed Hochma," as its Ohr Hochma is concealed in %0a%3c its Rosh and does not shine upon the other Partzufim and worlds, and only its %0a%3c Bina shines below. Thus, it is Bina (and not AA) that is called BERESHEET— %0a%3c BEGINNING, for she is the foundation and the source of all the worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 390 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And she is also called FEAR OF THE CREATOR, i.e., fear of His greatness, %0a%3c "for He is the only Master and the root of all, and all that exists is as nothing %0a%3c compared to Him." And ZON (called HEAVEN AND EARTH) emerge from %0a%3c Bina. It is therefore written in the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING (with fear) AVI, %0a%3c THE CREATOR CREATED HEAVEN (ZA) AND EARTH (Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said: "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom (Hochma)" %0a%3c and "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." Ohr Hochma %0a%3c stems not from the Sefira Hochma de AA, but from Bina de AA alone. For when %0a%3c Bina de AA ascends to Rosh de AA, it turns to the Sefira Hochma and then passes the %0a%3c Light downward. It follows that the Sefira Bina, fear of the Creator, is the source of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; hence, it is said, "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of Hochma." %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, fear is the beginning of knowledge, for the Sefira Daat is the beginning %0a%3c of ZON: ZON raise their request to Rosh de AA in order to receive Hochma. %0a%3c And this request of ZON regarding reception of Ohr Hochma, which is received %0a%3c and felt by AA, is called Daat, knowledge. This is why it is written: "Fear of the %0a%3c Creator is the beginning of knowledge (Daat)." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar also tells us that afterwards fear and love unite so as never to part %0a%3c again, for Hochma is called "love." Indeed, the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH %0a%3c is Bina, i.e., GAR de Bina (AVI) that wants only Ohr Hassadim, whereas Ohr %0a%3c Hochma is concealed within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the place of revelation of Ohr Hochma is ZAT de Bina, called YESHSL7T, %0a%3c the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH. Therefore, this place is called love, %0a%3c and it is the second Mitzva that follows the first Mitzva of fear, which shines in %0a%3c ZON, for this Ohr Hochma does not stem from Hochma de AVI, but from Bina, %0a%3c and Bina is known as fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c And The Zohar says that fear unites with love so as to never let it go. This %0a%3c means that Bina forever unites with Hochma and does not part with it. And %0a%3c wherever there is Bina, Hochma is there alongside her. And although it seems to %0a%3c write that one Mitzva is fear and another is love (that these are separate Mitzvot), %0a%3c they are nonetheless always together and are never apart: just as the first Mitzva %0a%3c includes the first, so the first includes the second. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason they have separate names is that we distinguish them by their %0a%3c dominance: in the first Mitzva, it is AVI, GAR de Bina, Bina herself along with her %0a%3c property. Hence, it is called "fear." However, in the second Mitzva it is Hochma %0a%3c that is dominant; hence, it is called "love." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the words of the Torah, IN THE BEGINNING THE CREATOR %0a%3c CREATED constitute concealment, and the revelation of these words begins %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 391 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, designating the ascent of Bina %0a%3c (BEGINNING) to Rosh de AA, where Bina becomes like Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c The combination of Hochma and Bina is then called GREAT LOVE. This %0a%3c is the meaning of the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, for Bina ascends to AA %0a%3c and passes the Light to all the lower worlds with GREAT LOVE, i.e., by means %0a%3c of two Lights: Hassadim and Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that the CREATOR'S LOVE IS CLARIFIED FROM %0a%3c TWO SIDES, as it is written: LET THERE BE LIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND %0a%3c IN THE WORLD TO COME. Because the Creator saw that this world cannot %0a%3c receive the Light, He concealed His Light and raised it above Parsa de AA, called %0a%3c (according to its corrected properties) "the world to come," above Chazeh de AA, %0a%3c where AVI or GAR de Bina reside. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa is located below Chazeh de AA, and it separates the Supernal Waters %0a%3c (AVI) from the lower waters (YESHSL7T + ZON). Since Ohr Hochma does not %0a%3c shine below Chazeh de AA, it is said that the Light is concealed from Partzufim %0a%3c YESHSUTand ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we see that Bina is divided into two parts: GAR de Bina (AVI), located %0a%3c above the Chazeh (Parsa de AA or the Supernal Waters), upon whom the Upper %0a%3c Light shines, meaning that secrets are revealed within them. He who ascends to %0a%3c this degree receives its Light, thereby meriting "wealth (Hochma) and longevity %0a%3c (Hassadim). His sons (his future corrections) are like olive sprouts (olive oil %0a%3c symbolizes Hochma), they gather round his table (Hassadim), and he rules over %0a%3c his enemies (impure forces), and whatever his wish may be, he succeeds in it %0a%3c (for Ohr Hochma is clothed in Ohr Hassadim)." ZAT de Bina are the lower waters, %0a%3c located below Chazeh de AA. The Light is concealed from them, and those who %0a%3c receive from them must love the Creator with the kind of love called "even if He %0a%3c takes away his soul." %0a%3c %0a%3c These are the two degrees of love for the Creator. That is to say, love for %0a%3c the Creator is not the desire and decision of man alone. Rather, like any of our %0a%3c other desires, it appears only by attaining a particular degree: if one attains the %0a%3c degree of YESHSUT, it allows him to love the Creator "even if He takes away %0a%3c his soul." However, an even more perfect love emerges within him who reaches %0a%3c the degree of AVI: he receives such Light from it that his love for the Creator %0a%3c becomes perfect on both sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, fear must be included in both kinds of love. For at the degree of AVI, %0a%3c one needs fear so as to not sin while in a state of spiritual ascent in AVI. And %0a%3c while at the degree of YESHSUT, one must fear lest his heart be hardened, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 392 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for Hochma and Bina correspond to love and fear in a state of eternal unity. %0a%3c Therefore, one must include the properties of Bina (fear) into GAR de Bina %0a%3c (AVI), as well as into ZAT de Bina (YESHSUT). %0a%3c %0a%3c Only then will love be perfect on both sides, in both forms: GAR and ZAT %0a%3c de Bina. Love cannot possibly be perfect only on one side, but only if fear exists %0a%3c on both sides, for Hochma (love) cannot exist without Bina (fear). %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that conditional love is the degree of AVI, whereas unconditional %0a%3c (perfect) love is the degree of YESHSLT. Yet, YESHSLT is below AVI. The thing %0a%3c is that man first receives Higher Sefirot of his emerging Partzuf, in the order %0a%3c KHB-ZA-M, but the Light enters them in the reverse order of NRNHY: first, he %0a%3c receives the Sefira Keter with the Light of Ne/esh, and in the end he receives the %0a%3c Sefira Malchut, though the Light of Yechida enters Keter. Therefore, if we measure %0a%3c according to the Sefirot (Kelim), the degree of AVI = GE = K-H (conditional love) %0a%3c is smaller than the degree of YESHSLT = AHP = B-ZA-M (unconditional love). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 204. The third M.itzva is to know that there is an Almighty Lord who governs %0a%3c the world, to unite this every day in the six Supernal limbs: HQT NHY of %0a%3c Zeir Anpin, and to unify them in the six words of the prayer "Hear O Israel," %0a%3c and with it to direct our desires upwards. Therefore, we must prolong the %0a%3c word "one" in the six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the %0a%3c Lord is one." %0a%3c %0a%3c In correspondence with the instruction to prolong the word "one," he who %0a%3c utters this verse should pronounce this word lengthily, as ooone. However, The %0a%3c Zohar obviously alludes not to a simple utterance of one's mouth, but rather to %0a%3c our true heartfelt intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c What is indicated here is that one needs to know and make a union. First, %0a%3c one must know the two sides of love, AVI and YESHSUT. AVI are called the %0a%3c "big and great ones in Hassadim," whereas YESHSUT is called "the Master of the %0a%3c World," for it contains judgment and restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c After man has attained both degrees of love and merited perfect love, he %0a%3c needs to know that there is a great Master who governs the entire world, and %0a%3c to unite this knowledge every day by using the six Supernal limbs, sides, that is, %0a%3c to raise MAN to ZON de Atzilut, and ZON will raise their MAN to YESHSUT. %0a%3c As a result, ZON and YESHSUT will ascend and unite with Partzuf AVI. This %0a%3c common Partzuf has six Supernal sides-limbs, for they all clothe VAK, the six %0a%3c lower Sefirot of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of this unity, YESHSUT ascends above Parsa de AA, to the place %0a%3c from the Peh down to the Chazeh, the place of the Supernal Waters. This is the %0a%3c permanent place of AVI, and the place where Light is revealed. When YESHSUT %0a%3c is filled with this Light, it passes it to ZON, which pass it on to the lower worlds, %0a%3c leading to the revelation of Ohr Hassadim in all the worlds. This is the secret of %0a%3c the union of "Hear, O Israel." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 394 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The six words: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One" %0a%3c constitute the six sides of ZON, which need to be united so as to unite them %0a%3c with the six Supernal sides, that is, AVI and YESHSUT. And man must direct %0a%3c his intentions and NRN upwards, so they, too, would unite with Supernal unity, %0a%3c just as MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c To achieve unity in VAK de ZA, in its six sides, the word "one" must be %0a%3c prolonged, meaning to receive Ohr Hochma within it, for Ohr Hochma descends %0a%3c from Ein Sof (infinity) to Supernal VAK, i.e., to AVI and YESHSUT, and unites %0a%3c VAK de ZA with the Light of Ein Sof. This is because the Gematria (numerical %0a%3c value) of the Hebrew word Echad (one) is Aleph + Chet + Dalet =1 + 8 + 4= 13, %0a%3c which indicates reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, while pronouncing the word "one," one should intend to draw %0a%3c Ohr Hochma to VAK de ZA. However, this unity lacks the intention to receive %0a%3c the Light of GAR in ZA, but only to enlarge its VAK through unity with the %0a%3c Supernal VAK, and to receive VAK de Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 205. It is therefore written, "Let the waters under the Heavens be gathered %0a%3c together onto one place." This means that all the degrees under the Heavens %0a%3c will gather onto one place, to become perfect in the six ends. Therewith, fear %0a%3c must be attached to the unity of the words: "Hear, O Israel," which is done by %0a%3c prolonging the pronunciation of the letter Dalet in the word Echad. This is %0a%3c why the letter Dalet in the word Echad is written larger than the other letters. %0a%3c It is written, "Let the dry land appear," to let the letter Dalet (designating dry %0a%3c land) be attached to that unity. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already explained, the unity contained in the words "Hear, O Israel" %0a%3c refers to the reception of Gadlut by VAK. This is because "one place" signifies %0a%3c the Supernal VAK, where the Light of Ein Sof shines within Ohr Hochma, under %0a%3c the Heavens (Bina), with regard to the earth (ZA). The words "onto one place" %0a%3c imply the unification of all the six Upper and lower sides, so the lower Partzufim %0a%3c will receive Ohr Hochma and unite with VAK de ZA, but only as VAK de Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we have already clarified, there are two kinds of fear and two kinds of %0a%3c love: the Upper fear and love are called AVI, whereas the lower fear and love are %0a%3c called YESHSUT. However, perfection is attained only by attaining both degrees %0a%3c together. Hence, the Light is concealed in YESHSUT, so the lower kind of love %0a%3c ("even if He takes away the soul") will be revealed. But even in this case, fear %0a%3c must cling to love and prevent the hardening of the heart; only then does one %0a%3c reveal perfect love, merges with AVI and YESHSUT, and receives the complete %0a%3c Creator's goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 395 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the unity of "Hear, O Israel," and after ZON ascend and unite with their %0a%3c properties in the six Upper sides to receive within them the "Great Love" in the %0a%3c word "one," they receive the Light that was made on the first day of creation, of %0a%3c which it is written: "And the Creator said, 'Let there be Light'" (Beresheet, 1:3). %0a%3c %0a%3c And to all of this unity one must attach fear, since he needs to reveal and %0a%3c receive the Light that is deliberately concealed in YESHSUT, so as to unite the %0a%3c lower love and fear, for they still cannot be considered perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is said that one should prolong the pronunciation of the Dalet %0a%3c in the word Echad (one) when reciting the prayer, Shema Israel, Adonay Eloheinu, %0a%3c Adonay EchaD-D-Dl (Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our Creator, the Lord is One). %0a%3c In this case, the letter Dalet is written in large font. This is because big letters %0a%3c refer to Tvuna, and the big Dalet in the word Echad indicates that its place is in %0a%3c Tvuna, and that the Light is concealed there. By attracting it, not by utterance, %0a%3c of course, but by the spiritual action, man unites its concealment with the lower %0a%3c fear and love. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THE DRY LAND APPEARED means that there is no perfection %0a%3c in the Upper fear and love, expressed in the six words of the prayer "Hear, %0a%3c O Israel" with the help of the word "one." These words correspond to "Let %0a%3c there be Light," until the unity of fear and love is achieved below. This unity is %0a%3c revealed in the Light that is concealed in Tvuna, designated by the letter Dalet %0a%3c (D) in the word Echad. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the WATERS GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE %0a%3c PLACE, signifying the descent of Ohr Hochma into the six parts of ZA, DRY %0a%3c LAND APPEARED. It denotes the letter Dalet in the word Echad, which should %0a%3c be pronounced with (spiritual) prolongation, with the aim to turn it into land %0a%3c through the concealment of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of this is essential in order to unite the D, Tvuna, with AVI, resulting in %0a%3c the descent of the Light to VAK de ZON, so that love could be made perfect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 206. After Mcdchut unites with ZA Above (in VAK de ZON), they must %0a%3c now be united below, in the masses, i.e., in all six sides of Malchut, in %0a%3c the words, BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED %0a%3c (Blessed be the great name of His kingdom for ever and ever), which contain %0a%3c six other words of unity. And then, what was dry land will become fertile %0a%3c soil, yielding fruit and plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c After the Supernal union is achieved, when the letter Dalet in the word %0a%3c Echad becomes whole Above, in AVI, it is essential to unite the Dalet in the %0a%3c word Echad below, in VAK, in the six aspects of Nukva de ZA (Rachel), who %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 396 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c stands from Chazeh de ZA and below. All 600,000 souls of Israel, called "the %0a%3c inhabitants of Nukva," are included in Rachel. %0a%3c %0a%3c After ZA unites in the Light of AVI, and the concealment of Tvuna (in the %0a%3c words DRY LAND APPEARED or in the letter Dalet) is revealed in him, Nukva %0a%3c must be filled with these two revelations. This is designated by the six words, %0a%3c BARUCH SHEM KVOD MALCHUTO LEOLAM VAED, corresponding to the %0a%3c six Sefirot HGT NHY of Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already explained that the Light was concealed in order to reveal %0a%3c both sides of love— good and evil. Yet, neither side of love, good or evil, can %0a%3c be revealed through concealment, but only through revelation of judgment. %0a%3c Before judgment was revealed, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was DRY %0a%3c LAND— utterly useless. This is because it emerged from the Light due to the %0a%3c concealment. Even fear to unite in the lower fear and love, which supplement %0a%3c the Upper fear and love was absent from it, for the judgment that reveals the %0a%3c lower fear and love was not yet revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Strictness and judgment are located in the legs of Partzuf Leah, which are %0a%3c included in the Rosh of Partzuf Rachel. ZA has two Nukvaot (plural for Nu/cva): %0a%3c Leah (above his Chazeh) and Rachel (below his Chazeh). Leah's legs end at the %0a%3c Chazeh de ZA and touch Rachel's Rosh. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NukvaotofZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Leah: Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Body %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mouth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Rachel: Head %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Body %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Legs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Feet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Worlds of BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c Our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 397 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since strictness and judgment are located at the end of the legs of Partzuf %0a%3c Leah, this affects only Partzuf Rachel, as each spiritual property acts only from %0a%3c the place of its manifestation and below. Therefore, the concealment in the %0a%3c lower love and fear manifests only in the place in Rachel where the force of %0a%3c strictness and judgment is manifested. %0a%3c %0a%3c Prior to the revelation of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad was %0a%3c dry land, a place that is unfit for living. Now, however, after the descent of Partzuf %0a%3c Rachel into VAK, below Chazeh de ZA, the dry land became fertile, suitable for %0a%3c settlement and cultivation of fruits. In other words, the lower love and fear %0a%3c were revealed in it in completion and perfection. And they complement the %0a%3c Upper love and fear, so that all are perfect on both sides, for that is when all the %0a%3c goodness is revealed in AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said, THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH- %0a%3c ERETZ (the word Eretz is derived from Ration— desire), for it is the property of %0a%3c the letter Dalet in the word Echad in the six Sefirot (sides) of Nukva de ZA (where %0a%3c the property of strictness and judgment is already revealed). The letter Dalet that %0a%3c was in DRY LAND and made its property inanimate and unfit to live on turns %0a%3c into EARTH in Nukva de ZA (as a result of a Zivug with ZA), can now be settled %0a%3c and cultivated; hence, the Creator called it "earth." %0a%3c %0a%3c 207. It is written, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH. %0a%3c This refers to the same unity below, by the words, BLESSED BE HIS GREAT %0a%3c NAME FOR EVER AND EVER, when the earth, called "desire," became %0a%3c what it should be. For the word "earth" (Eretz) means desire (Ratzon). Hence, %0a%3c the expression IT WAS GOOD appears twice on the third day of creation: %0a%3c once for the Upper unity and once for the lower. For Malchut merges with %0a%3c both sides of ZA— with VAK de ZA and with her own VAK. Henceforth, the %0a%3c earth brings forth grass, for it has been corrected to yield fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper unity (described by the words, WATERS GATHERED %0a%3c TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE) passes the Light that was created on the %0a%3c first day of creation from Above downwards, from the six Upper sides of AVI %0a%3c to VAK de ZA. This is called by the first word, IT WAS GOOD, uttered by the %0a%3c Creator on the third day of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then occurs the lower unity, designated by the verse, BLESSED BE HIS %0a%3c GREAT NAME FOR EVER AND EVER. This means that the letter Dalet in %0a%3c the word Echad attains perfection only from the six sides of Nu/cva, as described %0a%3c by the verses, AND THE CREATOR CALLED THE DRY LAND EARTH and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 398 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE EARTH SHALL BRING FORTH GRASS, for in VAK de Nukva, DRY %0a%3c LAND turned to EARTH, yielding fruits. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to this unity of VAK de Nukva, the Creator said, IT WAS %0a%3c GOOD, for the second time on the third day of creation. It follows that when %0a%3c IT WAS GOOD is said for the first time, it refers to the Upper unity. And the %0a%3c second time refers to the lower. Because of the lower unity, both sides of love %0a%3c achieve perfection, and the Light of AVI descends to VAK de Nukva, and bears %0a%3c fruit for the 600,000 souls of Israel that inhabit her. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 208. The fourth Mitzva is to know that HaVaYaH (the Creator) is Elokim %0a%3c (Lord), as it is written; KNOW THIS DAY AND LAY IT IN YOUR HEART %0a%3c THAT HaVaYaH-CREATOR IS ELOKIM— LORD. That is, the name %0a%3c Elokim is included in the name of the HaVaYaH, and there is no distinction %0a%3c between them. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH is ZA, and Elokim is Nukva de ZA. It is essential to unite ZA with %0a%3c Nukva by making their properties similar, so there is no distinction between %0a%3c them. Thus, the name Elokim of Nukt/a will be included in the name HaVaYaH %0a%3c of ZA, so that Nukva herself will become as HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c This union signifies the reception of Ohr Hochma (GAR) in ZON, for the %0a%3c union implied by the words HEAR, O ISRAEL is the reception of the Light of %0a%3c VAK from AVI in ZON. The unity in question here is the reception from AVI in %0a%3c ZON of the Light of GAR (Hochma). One can never receive an entire degree in %0a%3c one go: first VAK is received, and only then GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c 209. Hence, it is written, "Let the stars in Heaven shine upon the earth." %0a%3c This means that both names, HaVaYaH and ELOKIM, are as one. This way, %0a%3c Malchut (Elokim) should merge with the name HaVaYaH (ZA). The black Light %0a%3c (Malchut) with the white Light (ZA), as one, without distinction. The white %0a%3c cloud by day (ZA) with the pillar of fire by night (Malchut)', the property of day %0a%3c (ZA) merged with the property of night (Malchut), so they shine as one star. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva is called "a small star." Initially, there were two stars, ZA and Malchut, %0a%3c and both were the same size. But the moon (Malchut) complained that two stars %0a%3c cannot use one crown (source of Light). The Creator reply to Malchut was, "Go %0a%3c and diminish yourself (Talmud, Hulin, 60:2). %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut descended below the Parsa to %0a%3c the world of Beria, and only one Sefira, Keter de Malchut, remained in the world %0a%3c %0a%3c 399 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 400 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of Atzilut. The task of the righteous is to elevate the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut %0a%3c from the world of Beria to the level of ZA, to correct her distinction from ZA, %0a%3c i.e., to grow and make her equal to ZA once more, so she will make a Zivug with %0a%3c ZA face to face. Thus, they shall correct the detachment of Malchut from ZA that %0a%3c was born of the moon's complaint. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moon complained because it was unable to receive the Light directly %0a%3c from Ima, but only via ZA. Hence, the Creator gave it His advice: diminish %0a%3c yourself to a point (the Sefira Keter) and lower the nine Sefirot from Hochma to %0a%3c Malchut below the Parsa. Then, through the unity of "Hear, O Israel," rebuild %0a%3c Malchut in VAK, in the lower unity of "Blessed be His great name for ever and %0a%3c ever," for the power of judgment within it corrects the letter Dalet in the word %0a%3c Echad, turning the DRY LAND into the fruit-yielding EARTH. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the now black point of Malchut that caused its fall became as %0a%3c important as Light, for it is precisely the strictness of judgment that builds the %0a%3c letter Dalet in the word Echad and makes it fruit-bearing. And if Malchut had not %0a%3c had this power of judgment, the letter Dalet in the word Echad (Tvuna) would %0a%3c have remained DRY LAND. Hence, when the Light spreads inside her, the %0a%3c power of judgment and restriction becomes more important than Light itself, %0a%3c for it becomes the cause, the source of the Light of VAK, Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it is now possible to receive Ohr Hochma in VAK de Malchut, while %0a%3c elevating ZON to AVI. For now, just like ZA, Nulcua can unite with AVI in her %0a%3c properties. This was the basis of her previous complaint, for the Light-restricting %0a%3c power within her turned into the cause of the Light's diffusion. Hence, ZA and %0a%3c Malchut are considered a single whole: each of them constitutes the source of %0a%3c Light for the other, whereas previously, Malchut was completely dependent on %0a%3c ZA, and therefore felt humiliated. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the union between ZA and Nukva in AVI, ZA connects to Aba, %0a%3c and Nukva to Ima. ZA turns into white clouds in the daylight and Nukva turns %0a%3c into a pillar of fire in the Light of night, i.e., the properties of day and night %0a%3c merge into one property, as it is written: AND THERE WAS EVENING AND %0a%3c THERE WAS MORNING, ONE DAY. Together they illuminate the earth and %0a%3c those who inhabit Nukva in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c 210. This is the sin of the primeval serpent that unites below but separates %0a%3c Above; hence, it caused what it caused to the world. What should be united %0a%3c Above, should be separated below. The black light, which is Malchut, %0a%3c should be united Above with ZA into a single whole and then separate it %0a%3c from the "evil side." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 401 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The union and fulfillment of ZON with Ohr Hochma occurs only when %0a%3c they ascend to AVI, above Chazeh de AA, where ZA merges with Aba and Nukva %0a%3c merges with Ima. As a result, they unite, and ZA passes Ohr Hochma to Malchut. %0a%3c However, in the permanent place of ZON, below Chazeh de AA, they cannot %0a%3c form a union and allow ~Nukva to receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is exactly what provoked Adam's sin and allowed the Serpent to bring %0a%3c death into the world (cause the disappearance of Ohr Hochma from Malchut), by %0a%3c compelling Adam and Chava (Eve) to make a Zivug (union) in the permanent %0a%3c place of ZON, below Chazeh de AA. As a result, the Upper Zivug stopped in AVI, %0a%3c as ZA started passing Ohr Hochma from AVI down to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, all the parts (souls) of Malchut existing in the world stopped receiving %0a%3c Ohr Hochma from AVI. This is regarded as death, for as soon as the impure forces %0a%3c approach ZON to draw their Ohr Hochma, AVI immediately terminate their Zivug %0a%3c for the sake of ZON, to prevent the impure force from clinging to ZON. And as %0a%3c soon as Ohr Hochma departs from ZON, the impure force leaves them at once, %0a%3c for it approaches ZON with the sole purpose of feeding on Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after being in Ima and receiving Ohr Hochma, Malchut descends to %0a%3c her permanent place and passes this Light to the souls of the righteous, called %0a%3c the "inhabitants of Malchut." She unites with them via equivalence of their %0a%3c properties, for in the absence of unity with ZA below, Malchut draws far from %0a%3c the evil side and the impure forces cannot receive from her. %0a%3c %0a%3c 211. Nevertheless, one should know that Elokim and HaVaYaH are one, %0a%3c without distinction. HaVaYaH is Elokim. If man knows that all is one and %0a%3c does not cause any separation, then even the opposite, impure forces disappear %0a%3c from the world, instead of descending below. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although there is fear that a Zivug will occur in ZON in their place below, %0a%3c this is no cause to stop aspiring for a Zivug Above, in AVI. Moreover, one must %0a%3c attain that HaVaYaH is Elokim, which is achieved by uniting ZA with Nukva. %0a%3c And if man raises his MAN, thereby causing ZON to ascend to AVI and unite %0a%3c there, the impure forces are completely rejected by the Light, weaken and finally %0a%3c disappear from the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 212. The secret behind the word h/le'orot, which consists of the words %0a%3c Mavet (death) and Ohr (Light), is that the impure forces follow knowledge, %0a%3c understanding, and thought. And this is Light, which is the opposite from %0a%3c death— Mavet, for the Light (Ohr) is inside death— Mavet (spelled as Me'ot) in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 402 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word ME'ohrOT. This alludes to the fact that Light separates death, but %0a%3c when Light disappears, the letters unite and form the word "death." %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces follow reason (knowledge, understanding, and thought). %0a%3c Reason signifies "Light," and the impure force is "death," where Light connects %0a%3c the letters, while death separates them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here is the explanation of this: the power of restriction in Malchut is the %0a%3c source of the emergence of the impure forces. Because ZON united with AVI %0a%3c so as to receive the Light of VAK and GAR, the power of restriction in Malchut %0a%3c turned into Light by receiving the Light of VAK in the union below. Then, it %0a%3c ascended to AVI once more, and Malchut merged with ZA at the degree of AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c This union Above is designated by the word Me'orot = Ohr + Mavet. As a %0a%3c result of the Light of VAK and GAR descending to Nukva in the union with ZA %0a%3c at the level of AVI, the power of restriction in Malchut turns into Light, and all %0a%3c the impure forces that were created by this restriction disappear, for their root %0a%3c turns to Light. Consequently, the letters of the word Mavet of the impure forces %0a%3c disappear, and the words Me'ohrot Ohr appear instead. %0a%3c %0a%3c 213. Chava started with these letters, and brought evil into the world. As it %0a%3c is written, the woman SAW that it was good to bring the letters of the word %0a%3c Me'ohrot back. From there she took the letters Vav-Tav-Reish-Aleph, leaving %0a%3c only the letters Mem and Vav. And they took with them the letter Tav, thus %0a%3c forming the word Mem- Vav- Tav (Mavet— death). And they brought death %0a%3c into the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thanks to the unity of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, designating the %0a%3c reception of Ohr Hochma in ZON, in the unity of ZON Above, the received Light %0a%3c separates the letters of Mavet in AVI, for it shines within them and forms a new %0a%3c combination of the letters Me'ohrot. And if ZON make a union below, at their %0a%3c permanent place, the Light disappears from the combination of letters Me'ohrot, %0a%3c and the word Mavet (death) remains. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THE WOMAN SAW THAT THE TREE WAS GOOD (Beresheet, %0a%3c 3:6). The Hebrew equivalent for the words "and saw" is Vetir'e = Vav-Tav-Reish- %0a%3c Aleph. These are the letters that depart from the word Me'ohrot (stars), leaving %0a%3c only Mem- Vav. They attach the letter Tav (Nukva of the impure forces) and form %0a%3c the word Mavet— the name for Klipot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chava drew these letters from the word Me'ohrot, meaning she followed the %0a%3c serpent's advice to unite ZON at their place below. In doing so, she violated %0a%3c the holy union of the letters in the word Me'ohrot, for the union of ZON below %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 403 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c immediately causes the separation of AVI and the word Me'ohrot into Ohr %0a%3c (Light) and Mavet (death). %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces, called "death," contain a male part, called "Sam," and a %0a%3c female part, called "Lilit." The letter Mem is the male part of the word MaveT, %0a%3c called "Sam," and the letter Tav is its female part, called "Lilit." Thus, there was %0a%3c a Zivug between the male and female parts, the letters Mem, Tav and Yesod (Vav), %0a%3c forming the word MaVeT, as the name of the impure force. %0a%3c %0a%3c This signifies the appearance of the serpent before Chava, and the %0a%3c transference of impurity from it to her. As she followed its advice, the letter Tav %0a%3c entered her, splitting the word Ohr (Light) and combining the letters into the %0a%3c word Vetir'e (AND SAW). Then, the male part of the impure force (Mem-Vat;) %0a%3c appeared and made a Zivug with Tav, which was already present in Chava; thus, %0a%3c death (MaVeT) appeared in the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c 214. And look: said Rabbi Elazar: "My father, I have learned that after Chava %0a%3c had removed the letters VeTiR'E from the word Me'ohrot, the letters Mem %0a%3c and Vav did not remain. Only the letter Mem remained, for the letter Vav, %0a%3c which is the letter of life, turned into death. This occurred because it attached %0a%3c the letter Tav to itself, thus forming the word MaVeT." He replied: "Blessed %0a%3c are you, my son!" %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Elazar answered that the letter Mem remained alone, without the %0a%3c letter Vav, for Vav designates Yesod, whereas Sam (the male part of the impure %0a%3c forces) lacks Yesod; hence, it is written that it is unable to procreate offspring, %0a%3c akin to a castrated man. The letter Vav designates Yesod, the place of a Zivug, the %0a%3c union of the male and female parts of ZON. The letter Vav always designates %0a%3c life, Yesod of the pure forces, whose Zivug bears fruit, for it is made on the screen %0a%3c that stands in Yesod. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, the pure letter Vav became impure and turned into Yesod of the impure %0a%3c force, MaVeT. After Vav received from Yesod of the pure forces, it united in a %0a%3c Zivug with Tav, and the word MaVeT was formed. This was precisely the sin of %0a%3c Adam, which defiled the pure Vav. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 215. The fifth Mitzva. It is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH %0a%3c SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES (Beresheet, 1:20). This verse contains %0a%3c three Mitzvot. The first is to study the Torah, the second is to procreate and %0a%3c multiply, and the third is to remove the foreskin on the eighth day. And it is %0a%3c necessary to study the Torah on all the days, at all times, in order to correct %0a%3c one's soul and spirit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four previous Mitzvot originate in the first four days of creation, and are %0a%3c intended for the correction of the degrees H-B-ZA-M of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The First Mitzva originates from the word BERESHEET (Bina, fear of the %0a%3c Great and Mighty Creator, who rules over all), referring only to GAR de Bina %0a%3c that is located in AVI. The position of AVI is from Peh to Chazeh de AA, Yod of %0a%3c the name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Second Mitzva originates from the words LET THERE BE LIGHT, %0a%3c and is meant for the correction of ZAT de Bina (called YESHSLT), located from %0a%3c Chazeh to Tahur de AA, i.e., below its Parsa. However, when it is said, LET THERE %0a%3c BE LIGHT, this means that YESHSLT ascended and united with AVI, forming %0a%3c one Partzuf above Chazeh de AA. And from there they ascended to Rosh de AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a state (degree) is called "Great love," designated by the first letter %0a%3c (Hey) of the name HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey, and the Light passes from it to %0a%3c ZON. However, ZON cannot receive Ohr Hochma from AVI, for they are GAR de %0a%3c Bina and will always remain only with Ohr Hassadim, unwilling to receive, hence %0a%3c their name, "fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON, however, receive Ohr Hochma from ZAT de Bina (YESHSLT), which %0a%3c ascended above Parsa de AA, called "Great love." However, YESHSLT, which %0a%3c stand below Parsa de AA, cannot pass Ohr Hochma to ZA, for Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c concealed within them. Also, their Tvuna is called DRY LAND. %0a%3c %0a%3c 405 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 406 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Third Mitzva originates from the two stars that were created on the %0a%3c third day of creation, of which it is written: LET THE WATERS UNDER THE %0a%3c HEAVENS BE GATHERED TOGETHER ONTO ONE PLACE, AND LET %0a%3c THE DRY LAND APPEAR... and LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH GRASS. %0a%3c This Mitzva is intended for the correction of VAK de ZON, whose union Above %0a%3c stems from the verse, LET THE WATERS, referring to ZA, whereas the union %0a%3c below stems from the verse, LET THE EARTH PUT FORTH GRASS, and %0a%3c refers to VAK de Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourth Mitzva originates from the verse, LET THE STARS, and is %0a%3c meant for the correction of GAR in ZA and Malchut. Thus, all the corrections %0a%3c necessary for AVI, YESHSUT and ZON de Atzilut have already taken place in the %0a%3c first four days of creation. ZON received GAR (Ohr Hochma), and, being of equal %0a%3c height, can now make a Zivug face to face. Therefore, the rest of the Mitzvot are %0a%3c intended for this Zivug of ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Mitzva is LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES. Now there is a need to bring ZON to a perfect face-to- %0a%3c face Zivug, i.e., (i) to receive Ohr Neshama onto this Zivug, so that Adam, too, %0a%3c will receive this Light and make a holy and pure Zivug, which is attained by %0a%3c man's efforts in the study of the Torah; (ii) to give birth to holy souls; and (iii) %0a%3c to correct the holy covenant by circumcision and rejection. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's efforts lie in that he studies the Torah, although he realizes that he %0a%3c does not attain it (receives nothing in his corrected desires, called Guf, body). He %0a%3c merely utters its words with his "mouth" (not yet able to receive the Light (Torah) %0a%3c in his body for the Creator's sake), but as a result, he attains Ohr Nefesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's efforts should correspond to his readiness to do everything in his %0a%3c power to attain and understand the Torah, which causes him to attain Ohr %0a%3c Ruach. However, he must not limit himself to such attainments, but rather %0a%3c multiply his efforts so as to attain Ohr Neshama. Thus, every day he must aspire %0a%3c to correct his Nefesh and Ruach, and by increasing them, attain Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c 216. Because man labors in the study of the Torah, he corrects the other holy %0a%3c soul, as it is written, SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES, referring to the %0a%3c life-giving holy soul, Malchut. For when man does not study the Torah, he %0a%3c lacks the holy soul and the holiness that descends from Above. Yet, when he %0a%3c does study the Torah, he merits its Light, just like holy angels. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva de ZA that makes a face-to-face Zivug with ZA in the state of Gadlut is %0a%3c called "living," for ZA is then called the "Tree of Life." Consequently, Nukva is %0a%3c called "Life." By raising MAN during the study of Torah for the Creator's sake, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 407 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c man causes ZON to make a Zivug and receives Ohr Ne/esh from it. And if he does %0a%3c not study the Torah for the Creator's sake, he cannot even attain Ohr Ne/esh, for %0a%3c he fails to bring about the Creator's Zivug with the Shechina. And a Zivug can be %0a%3c attained only by raising MAN. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES, for the Torah is called "water." If man raises MAN with %0a%3c the help of the Torah, he merits Ohr Ne/esh (holy spirit) from Ohr Haya (Life). %0a%3c Moreover, he merges with the Creator only after he attains Ne/esh, Ruach, and %0a%3c Neshama from HAYA (Supernal holy life). He unites Ohr Ne/esh with Ohr Ruach, %0a%3c Ohr Ruach with Ohr Neshama, and Ohr Neshama with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c 217. It is written, "Angels of the Creator shall bless Him." This refers to those %0a%3c who study the Torah, as they are called His angels on earth. It is also written, %0a%3c BIRDS SOARING OVER THE EARTH. This refers to this world. However, %0a%3c in the world to come, as it is said, the Creator will make them wings like those %0a%3c of an eagle so they may soar in the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Why does The Zohar mention angels? Because angels are spiritual forces- %0a%3c mechanical enactors of the Creator's will. They were repeatedly compared to %0a%3c animals in our world (e.g., a horse) that fulfill man's will. Angels are spiritual %0a%3c forces without freedom or egoism; hence, they never sin and have no need for %0a%3c the Torah, which is why they are spiritually inanimate, motionless— they do not %0a%3c grow spiritually. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man is created in such a way that before he carries out any task, he needs to %0a%3c realize what he is supposed to do. But angels carry out their assignments even %0a%3c before they hear and understand what the Creator wants from them, for His %0a%3c desire rules over them. Hence, nothing prevents them from instant fulfillment %0a%3c of His will. They always follow the Creator, just like man's shadow follows him. %0a%3c This is why they are believed to act before they even hear. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man can therefore act like an angel (even though his desires are of egoistic %0a%3c nature) if his desires become like those of angels, whose actions precede their %0a%3c understanding (hearing). Just like an angel, such a person fulfills all the Creator's %0a%3c desires before he realizes, hears and understands them, for he follows the Creator %0a%3c as a shadow follows man. %0a%3c %0a%3c This can be illustrated by the following example: when a strong wind throws %0a%3c dust in one's eyes, he quickly shuts them, even before his brain and thoughts %0a%3c feel and realize the need to do so: the action (shutting the eyes) precedes the %0a%3c actual realization of the thought of dust. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 408 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the physical body of such a person exists together with us in this %0a%3c world, his spiritual body (desires) becomes angel-like, and his actions precede %0a%3c his hearing. He does not need to hear in order to fulfill the Creator's will, but %0a%3c observes any Mitzva even before his brain realizes what he is doing. Therefore, %0a%3c he is regarded as an angel. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, The Zohar says that in the future the Creator will provide him with %0a%3c wings to enable him to soar over the whole world. For until man attains the holy %0a%3c soul (Ohr Ne/esh— the smallest spiritual Light), the impure force rules over him, %0a%3c as the prophet said: "The souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as from %0a%3c the hollow of a sling" (Shmuel I, 25:29). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, one cannot merge with the Creator and observe His desires (Mitzvot) %0a%3c until he has acquired faith in the Creator's names and knows that He is absolutely %0a%3c good to all and bestows only goodness. And if one has not yet attained the holy %0a%3c soul, and the impure force still rules over him, when his thoughts soar above %0a%3c the world, it seems to him as though the Creator's rule is not quite as good as it %0a%3c should be according to His names. This feeling of his brings corruption to the %0a%3c Creator's holy names, and he cannot find a quiet place for himself, cannot have %0a%3c faith in His names and draw closer to Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he stains himself with such impurity that it leads him toward %0a%3c lack of faith in the Creator and in His names. However, nothing of this affects %0a%3c the spiritual; it occurs simply because man has not yet attained the spiritual %0a%3c realm, and is making no effort to do so. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as he receives the holy soul (Ohr Ne/esh), his body (desires and %0a%3c thoughts) instantly becomes angel-like: his actions precede realization. It is written %0a%3c about such a person: "And the birds shall soar above the earth," for in the future, %0a%3c the Creator will give him wings, and he will soar above the whole world. %0a%3c %0a%3c For he soars mentally above the whole world and sees how the Creator %0a%3c governs all. Yet, not only does he not err when seeing the manifestation of this %0a%3c governance, he receives the strength to raise MAN to increase his spiritual anti- %0a%3c egoistic powers. By looking upon all the forms of the Creator's rule over this %0a%3c world and, seeing the harshness of the external manifestations of this rule, such %0a%3c a person is given an opportunity to ask for the strengthening of his faith. And %0a%3c owing to his faith in the Creator's unity and absolute kindness of His rule, he %0a%3c raises MAN and receives increasingly greater Light for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c 218. It is written in this regard: LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, %0a%3c for the Torah, called THE WATERS, will SWARM WITH SWARMS OF %0a%3c LIVING CREATURES from its place of life, Malchut, and all will descend %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fifth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 409 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c down below. This is what King David referred to, when he said, THE %0a%3c CREATOR CREATED IN ME A PURE HEART to study The Torah, and %0a%3c A HOLY SPIRIT WAS RENEWED WITHIN ME. %0a%3c %0a%3c So as to continue to explain the aforementioned text, The Zohar compares %0a%3c the Torah to water— just as living creatures emerged from water, in the same %0a%3c way the Light of life descends from Malchut (called "life") upon the entire %0a%3c world. This is the Light for which King David asked the Creator. He begged %0a%3c for a pure heart in order to study the Torah and raise MAN, for this would %0a%3c lead him to the reception of the holy spirit of renewal— the strength to merge %0a%3c with the Creator even more. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sixth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 219. The sixth Mitzva is to procreate and multiply, for he who does so turns %0a%3c the stream, called Yesod de ZA, into an inexhaustible fountain. And the sea, %0a%3c Malchut, shall be filled from all directions, and new souls shall come forth %0a%3c from that tree, and a multitude of forces shall appear together with those %0a%3c souls, to guard them. Hence, it is written: LET THE WATERS SWARM %0a%3c WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES. This is the mark of the holy %0a%3c Covenant. The stream grows stronger, turns into a river, and thus brings more %0a%3c and more new souls to life. %0a%3c %0a%3c An awakening from below causes an awakening from Above: raising MAN, %0a%3c the prayers and requests of the lower ones to receive strength so they can perform %0a%3c spiritual, altruistic actions, stimulate a Zivug Above between the Creator and the %0a%3c Shechina. As a result, the stream, Yesod de ZA, fills with water and descends to %0a%3c Nukva de ZA, filling her on all sides, wishing to both revive all the worlds (to %0a%3c bestow Ohr Hassadim) and bear new souls (pass Ohr Hochma downward, for birth %0a%3c is possible only in Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds of Zivugim de ZON: (i) a "Zivug of existence" on Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, from which Ohr Hassadim descends to provide the lower souls with %0a%3c what they need for their existence. This Zivug on Ohr Hassadim also gives birth %0a%3c to angels, (ii) A "Zivug of birth" on Ohr Hochma, which leads to the creation of %0a%3c new Partzufim, new human souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c These new souls emerge from the Tree (ZA). However, although they are %0a%3c called new, the genuinely new souls originate in the world of Ein Sof (Infinity), %0a%3c whereas these souls were already within Adam, and fell into the impure forces %0a%3c as a result of his sin. Now they are revived with the help of the Tree of Life (ZA); %0a%3c hence, they are called "new souls." A multitude of other forces, called Heavenly %0a%3c %0a%3c 411 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 412 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c hosts or armies, descends along with them. But completely new souls descend to %0a%3c the world only after the correction of Adam's sin has been completed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod de ZA is called a "covenant," because we (Malchut, souls) feel and %0a%3c receive from it all the Light of our life. It constitutes the source of our life, %0a%3c descending to us from the Tree of Life (ZA). ZA ascends to AVI (called "garden") %0a%3c in order to take the waters from them and fill Malchut, his Nukva. A Zivug on %0a%3c VAK {Hassadim) is called WATERS SWARM, and a Zivug on GAR {Hochma) is %0a%3c called LIVING CREATURES. %0a%3c %0a%3c 220. A number of birds (angels) that soar above the whole world enter %0a%3c Malchut along with those souls. When a soul comes into this world, the bird %0a%3c that came from that tree along with that soul accompanies it. How many %0a%3c angels leave with each soul? Two: one on the right, and one on the left. If %0a%3c one so merits, they guard him, as it is written: FOR HE WILL GIVE HIS %0a%3c ANGELS CHARGE OVER YOU. Yet, if he does not merit, they report and %0a%3c accuse him. Rabbi Pinchas said: "There are three angels that guard man, %0a%3c if he so merits, as it is written, IF THERE BE AN ANGEL OVER HIM, %0a%3c A DEFENDER, ONE AMONG A THOUSAND THAT WARNS MAN. If %0a%3c there be an ANGEL— is the first; A DEFENDER— is the second; one among a %0a%3c thousand THAT WARNS man-is the third." %0a%3c %0a%3c 221. Rabbi Shimon said: "In all, there are five angels, for the verse continues: %0a%3c 'there is one after the giver and two more, so in all there are five.'" He replied: %0a%3c "This is not so. 'The giver' refers solely to the Creator Himself, and not to an %0a%3c angel, for only the Creator is permitted to give, but no one else." %0a%3c %0a%3c A number of angels come forth together with the begotten souls. These %0a%3c angels are called "soaring" or "flying." They help the souls to sentence to the %0a%3c scale of merit, or, conversely, complain to the Creator about these souls, and %0a%3c push them toward the scale of sin, which entails punishments. These angels soar %0a%3c above the world, see how the Creator rules over all, and report all this to the %0a%3c soul. If the soul so merits, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of %0a%3c merit; if not, it sentences itself and the entire world to the scale of sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Rabbi Pinchas does not dispute Rabbi Shimon when he says %0a%3c that only two angels are born with a soul. Rather, he says that as long as there %0a%3c are only two angels in man, he cannot sentence to the scale of merit completely, %0a%3c and keeps moving between the scales of sin (punishment) and merit (reward). %0a%3c However, through one's good deeds, the third angel is born within him, which %0a%3c enables man to sentence everything to the scale of merit. Hence, only with the %0a%3c help of the three angels can he achieve his correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sixth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 413 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 222. And he who abstains from procreating and multiplying belittles (so to %0a%3c speak) the form that includes all other forms, the form of man, causes that %0a%3c stream, Yesod of ZA, to dry out, and harms the holy Covenant (Yesod of %0a%3c ZA) from all sides. It is written of such a man, "Go forth and look upon %0a%3c the corpses of those that have transgressed against the Creator." Of course, %0a%3c those who transgress against Me. This is said about the body, as the soul never %0a%3c even enters the screen, i.e., the Creator's domain. And such a man shall be %0a%3c banished from the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called a "form," a "property" that contains all of the other %0a%3c properties, for all the forms of NRN of the righteous and of the angels in the %0a%3c three worlds of BYA originate from her. They constitute all the hosts and armies. %0a%3c And those that do not procreate and multiply thereby diminish the form of %0a%3c Malchut and prevent her from using all of her hosts and armies. For with the %0a%3c help of MAN that the lower ones raise, the Light descends from Above and %0a%3c stimulates a Zivug between the Creator and the Shechina. This Zivug creates %0a%3c NRN— the souls of the righteous and the angels in the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And those that impede this Zivug cause the stream (Yesod of ZA) to dry out %0a%3c and stop the flow of its male waters into the holy Shechina, Malchut. In doing so, %0a%3c they harm the holy covenant in all of its properties, for they delay the two parts %0a%3c of the Zivug: VAK (on Ohr Hassadim) and GAR (on Ohr Hochma). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is because the Mitzva of procreation and multiplication constantly %0a%3c develops the soul. As a result, man defeats his body forever, so it can rise again %0a%3c during the resurrection from the dead. And he who abstains from procreating %0a%3c and multiplying turns his body into a corpse, of which it is written: GO FORTH %0a%3c AND LOOK UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE, for his soul will not %0a%3c be able to enter the Creator's domain and merge with Him. Thus, he is rejected %0a%3c from the world to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Seventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 223. The seventh Mitzva is to perform circumcision on the eighth day, and thus %0a%3c remove the impurity of the foreskin, for Malchut constitutes the eighth degree %0a%3c of all the degrees, beginning with Bina. And the soul that soars from her must %0a%3c appear before her on the eighth day; hence, she constitutes the eighth degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nukva de ZA is called Haya if she rises and clothes Ima-Bina, the eighth %0a%3c degree from Malchut (provided that you count all ten Sefirot from below upwards). %0a%3c Malchut is hence called "the eighth," for she ascended eight degrees, from her %0a%3c own place to that of Bina. And when she reaches Bina, she receives the name %0a%3c Haya, just like Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, man's soul, which is born in Malchut (that ascended to Bina), %0a%3c must appear before Malchut in all the appropriate corrections of circumcision, %0a%3c removal of the foreskin and the rolling up of its remains, on the eighth day from %0a%3c its birth in Malchut. This is because then it becomes clear that it is a soul that %0a%3c was born from none other than the holy degree of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of the force of circumcision and rolling up, man's soul sloughs the %0a%3c impure force, and the soul can receive the perfection of Ohr Haya. LET THE %0a%3c WATERS SWARM— thus Malchut receives the Supernal male waters from ZON, %0a%3c and is filled with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c 224. It then becomes clear that the type of this soul is Haya. That is, belonging %0a%3c to that holy degree of Haya (Malchut), and not to any other degree. And this %0a%3c is implied by, LET THE WATERS SWARM, as is explained in the book of %0a%3c Hanoch, the waters of the holy seed merge in the properties of the soul of %0a%3c Haya. And it is the property of the letter Yod, marked on the sacred flesh, %0a%3c more than any other mark that exists in the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because of the circumcision, the Supernal male waters fill man's soul the %0a%3c way they were received in Nukva (called "the soul of Haya"). The Upper World, %0a%3c %0a%3c 415 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 416 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c called Bina, is designated by the letter Yod, and the lower world, Malchut, is %0a%3c designated by the letter Hey— its property. However, as Malchut ascends to Bina, %0a%3c the letter Hey disappears from her, and, just like Bina, turns into Yod. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, through man's observance of the Mitzva of spiritual circumcision, %0a%3c the letter Hey disappears, and just like in the Nukva that ascended to Bina, the %0a%3c property of the letter Yod appears in him instead. And if man's body acquires the %0a%3c property of Yod, he can receive the soul of Haya from Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c 225. The verse, LET BIRDS SOAR OVER THE EARTH, refers to Eliyahu, %0a%3c who flies across the whole world in four flights in order to be present in the %0a%3c place, where the Holy Covenant is made. And a chair must be prepared for %0a%3c him, and it must be said out loud, THIS IS THE CHAIR OF ELIYAHU. For %0a%3c this is not done so, he will not appear in that place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Angels originate from AVI; hence, they remain exclusively in the sky and %0a%3c consist of HGT NHY Therefore, when they appear in this world to fulfill their %0a%3c tasks, they are said to make six flights, for they clothe in six Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, Eliyahu stems from Malchut (not from AVI). Hence, he is %0a%3c constantly connected to the earth. And since Malchut contains only four Sefirot %0a%3c of ZA, for her position is parallel to the Sefirot TNHY (Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod, %0a%3c pronounced, Tanhi) from Chazeh de ZA downward, it is written that Eliyahu %0a%3c flies on four flights, i.e., by clothing in Sefirot TNHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Under no circumstances should one interpret the words about Eliyahu's %0a%3c presence at every rite of circumcision literally. Yet, if he is obliged to be there, %0a%3c why should he be invited? %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar explains this in another place (Shlach, 18): there are four impure %0a%3c forces, called "Stormy Wind," "Great Cloud," "Blazing Flame," and Noga. The %0a%3c lowest of them, Stormy Wind, is at the center, as though clothed by Great %0a%3c Cloud, which is in turn clothed by Blazing Flame. And they are all clothed from %0a%3c the outside by Noga. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the worlds, forces, and everything that was ever created exists within man. %0a%3c And these are our spiritual forces, by which we can attain the goal of creation. %0a%3c The first three impure forces are completely impure (egoistic). Whereas ~Noga is %0a%3c half good and half evil. But how is that possible if the spiritual is always true? %0a%3c How can it be half good (altruistic) and half evil (egoistic) at the same time? %0a%3c %0a%3c In fact, this is impossible. Noga is a neutral force that can be used by the %0a%3c pure force (then Noga is considered good) or by the impure force (and then it %0a%3c is considered evil). Hence, Noga is called "half good and half evil" although %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Seventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 417 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c neutral in itself. It may be attached to either pure or impure forces, and this %0a%3c depends entirely on man. %0a%3c %0a%3c MAN'S SPIRITUAL FORCES %0a%3c Pure - altruistic %0a%3c %0a%3c Noga - neutral %0a%3c %0a%3c Blazing Flame - egoistic %0a%3c Great Cloud - egoistic %0a%3c Stormy Wind - egoistic %0a%3c %0a%3c These four impure forces are located at the end of each spiritual Partzuf, in %0a%3c its Sefira Yesod. The Sefira Yesod has two layers of skin, one atop of the other. One %0a%3c layer is called Orla, and contains the three impure forces. The other is called %0a%3c Preia, and this is Noga. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first man, Adam, was born circumcised, meaning that he did not %0a%3c have the three impure forces at all— he was completely unaware of his egoistic %0a%3c desires. In other words, they could not cling to him. Noga prevailed in him, %0a%3c in his sensations. Yet, since it was separated from the three impure forces and %0a%3c attached to the pure force (Adam's altruistic desires), Noga itself was considered %0a%3c completely good. %0a%3c %0a%3c The three impure forces are collectively called the Serpent. These three %0a%3c impure desires were roused in Adam and tempted him to use them. In so doing, %0a%3c Adam attracted the Orla to himself, as it is described in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, %0a%3c 38:2). As soon as he attached Orla to himself, his pure soul (the Light of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut) immediately disappeared, for his desires became egoistic, and %0a%3c he fell with his properties (desires) to the world of Assiya, to its lowest degree, %0a%3c called "this world," and was condemned to death (disappearance of the Supernal %0a%3c spiritual Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written about him that since he violated the prohibition of %0a%3c not eating the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge, he attached the Orla to himself. %0a%3c Consequently, the impure desires acquired both layers of skin on the Sefira %0a%3c Yesod of Partzuf Adam, and Preia, called Noga, became impure, too, because %0a%3c of its contact with the Orla, with the three impure forces. However, there is a %0a%3c distinction between them, which lies in the fact that prior to Adam's sin, Preia %0a%3c was pure, and all of its impurity stems from its contact with the Orla. %0a%3c %0a%3c Accordingly, there are two types of correction: circumcision and rolling up %0a%3c of the remaining skin. The Orla must be cut off and cast in the dust, since only %0a%3c thus can man free himself from these egoistic desires. Preia, however, can be left %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 418 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c attached to Yesod. But the skin around the Sefira Yesod must be rolled up. This %0a%3c is a special spiritual action that frees the Preia from the impure forces remaining %0a%3c in it. Hence, this action causes the Light to return to the Partzuf. This Light %0a%3c previously disappeared because of the egoistic desires that ruled in the Partzuf %0a%3c before the spiritual circumcision took place. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this is still insufficient for the fulfillment of the spiritual Partzuf, %0a%3c Adam, with the Light, as it was before he sinned, i.e. used the Serpent's impure %0a%3c forces and tasted the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge (received Ohr %0a%3c Hochma in egoistic desires). For now, after Adam's sin and fall, a special angel by %0a%3c the name of SAM makes accusations and complaints against man. %0a%3c %0a%3c To neutralize the power of SAM, Eliyahu took upon himself his role of a %0a%3c prosecutor, and was thereby granted an opportunity to defend Israel (one who %0a%3c aspires to the Creator) when he circumcises himself (his egoistic desires). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is said that Eliyahu must be present at each rite of circumcision %0a%3c (Hebrew, Brit Mila— the Covenant with the Creator). For since it is he, rather than %0a%3c SAM, who complains to the Creator about Israel's neglect of their Covenant, he %0a%3c can also testify that when Israel aspires to the Creator, it is loyal to the covenant. %0a%3c As a result, the Light returns to the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why, besides the chair occupied by the man who holds the baby %0a%3c (Sanda/c-godfather), one more chair must be prepared for the prophet Eliyahu. %0a%3c For the chair designates the beginning of correction, the influence of the Upper %0a%3c One on the lower one. The first chair, on which the Sandak sits, belongs to %0a%3c the Creator, for the filling of Light as the result of the circumcision and the %0a%3c rolling up of the impure forces. The second chair is saved for Eliyahu, so he can %0a%3c neutralize the impure forces' complaints to the Creator against man, so they %0a%3c would not be able to accuse man. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, to make Eliyahu appear, one must say out loud: THIS IS THE %0a%3c CHAIR OF ELIYAHU. The thing is that a male baby is circumcised on the %0a%3c eighth day after Shabbat (Malchut with the Light of AVI, called "holy") has passed %0a%3c over him. Since the sloughed desires (Orla) are cast away, the impure force sees %0a%3c that it is given a part of the Creator's Covenant. Because of this gift, it stops %0a%3c complaining and accusing man. On the contrary, it begins to advocate him %0a%3c before the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual desires (objects) pass their properties from one to another. %0a%3c Since the Orla was attached to Yesod, after the circumcision (separation from %0a%3c Yesod) it takes part of the pure desires with it. And since we throw it to the dust, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Seventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 419 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the impure forces, they draw from it that weak Light, which they can receive %0a%3c from the circumcision and the rolling up. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the impure forces stop complaining against Israel, and no longer %0a%3c wish to destroy this Light, for in so doing they will lose the part that they draw %0a%3c from it. Thus, they become defenders of the pure forces, to allow the pure forces %0a%3c to be filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, Eliyahu cannot bear this correction, for although the Klipa stops %0a%3c impeding and slandering Israel, it takes part of the Light for itself in return. To %0a%3c correct this, Eliyahu takes upon himself all the accusations against Israel, and %0a%3c refuses to give anything from the pure to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, although the impure force stopped complaining against Israel, and %0a%3c actually became its defender, Eliyahu himself continues to accuse in order to %0a%3c wrest all the power from the impure forces and fully separate them from the %0a%3c pure. Hence, a chair must be prepared for Eliyahu, for it is he who fully separates %0a%3c the impure forces from the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c One must therefore verbalize the words: THIS IS THE CHAIR OF %0a%3c ELIYAHU. For after the circumcision, part of the Light still remains in the %0a%3c impure forces, and the mention of Eliyahu completely deprives them of any %0a%3c contact with the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, if man does not express his desire to detach himself completely from %0a%3c the impure forces, through his own effort (by the screen positioned in Peh), it %0a%3c does not happen, even though the first chair belongs to the Creator. This is %0a%3c because the Creator starts the process of creation (makes His foundation in %0a%3c the form of a chair), and man continues and corrects his nature by performing %0a%3c altruistic deeds. %0a%3c %0a%3c 226. And the Creator created great Leviathans. They were two: Orla and %0a%3c Preia, male and female forces, and all living creatures. This is the mark of %0a%3c the Holy Covenant, the soul of the holy Ohr Haya, as it is written, LET THE %0a%3c WATERS SWARM, the Supernal Waters that descend to this Covenant. %0a%3c %0a%3c Leviathan and his wife designate that which is opposite from Orla and Preia. %0a%3c They are also called Nachash (Serpent) and Alcaton (his wife). Orla is the Serpent, %0a%3c and Nachash is the male part that must be cut off and committed to dust. Preia %0a%3c is the correction, liberation from the Serpent's female part, Alcaton. Through %0a%3c these corrections, Ohr Haya of AVI descends from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c 227. The reason why Israel below is marked in the holy form, similar to its %0a%3c form from Above, is to separate the pure part from the impure, to distinguish %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 420 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c between the holiness of Israel and the other nations that originate from the %0a%3c other side. And just as Israel was marked, so were the animals and birds— to %0a%3c determine which of them belong to Israel, and which belong to the nations of %0a%3c the world. Happy is the lot of Israel! %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's attitude toward all the living creatures in our world is similar to the %0a%3c attitude of the general spiritual creation, called "man," toward his parts. This %0a%3c is because Adam includes absolutely everything within his spiritual body. And %0a%3c e is nothing except for this spiritual Partzuf, called "man" or "Adam." %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 spiritual objects, angels, souls, both pure and impure forces are part %0a%3c 's body. All that is described in Kabbalah speaks only of the spirit %0a%3c world, of one creature called "man," Adam. Adam's various parts, his varic %0a%3c desires— are called "Israe %0a%3c animals," and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that man must do in our world (for every one of us was created in the %0a%3c image of Adam, recreating Adam's entire Partzuf within him) is build a pure, %0a%3c ruistic Partzuf within him. This is done by cutting off all of the egoistic desires %0a%3c arating the pure from the impure in all his desires, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eighth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 228. The eighth Mitzva is to love an outsider from another nation, who desires %0a%3c to come under the wings of the Shechina, M.alchut, who takes under her %0a%3c wings those who separate themselves from the other, impure side, and draw %0a%3c near her, as it is written: LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH A LIVING %0a%3c SOUL AFTER ITS KIND. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, Nukva de ZA, is called the Shechina, for she does not distance from %0a%3c us even when our properties are distant from her, as it is said: WHEREVER %0a%3c YOU ARE BANISHED, THE SHECHINA WILL BE WITH YOU, and %0a%3c ABIDES IN THEM, IN THEIR IMPURITY. ZA is called Shochen (dweller) and %0a%3c Nulcva is called Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The revelation of the Creator in Malchut, of the Shochen in the Shechina, of %0a%3c ZA in Malchut of the world of Atzilut is possible only by a face-to-face Zivug of %0a%3c ZON in Gadlut. This is because the Light of this Zivug is so great that it reveals %0a%3c unity even in the most remote and concealed places, in the most opposite and %0a%3c uncorrected desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the creation of Gadlut de ZON occurs gradually: first, a Partzuf %0a%3c of ZON in Katnut is created with the Light of VAK, and only then does it %0a%3c grow to reach Gadlut. Moreover, this process takes place in each state of ZON. %0a%3c Furthermore, even as ZON in Gadlut make a Zivug and receive Ohr Hochma, the %0a%3c Light from their previous state of Katnut does not disappear, but facilitates a %0a%3c Zivug in Gadlut. And this Light of Katnut is called the "Wings of Shechina." %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written in the Torah: "And the cherubim shall spread out their %0a%3c wings on High, screening the ark-cover with their wings" (Shemot, 25:20). For the %0a%3c main thing is to cover the Light of the great Zivug with their wings, so that even %0a%3c the most distant ones would receive the Light, and, at the same time, keep it out %0a%3c of the reach of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 421 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 422 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because those who have yet to completely purify their egoistic %0a%3c desires are rejected by the Light for fear that the Light may fall to the impure %0a%3c forces. But now the wings guard the Light so vigilantly that even the closest ones %0a%3c will not err and let the Light through to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, an outsider is one who decides to join the people of Israel (to %0a%3c correct his egoistic desires and make them altruistic), and to be circumcised %0a%3c (reject his egoistic desires), for his body (collection of desires) still retains the %0a%3c properties of the Orla, as his ancestors (previous spiritual states) did not stand %0a%3c at the foot of Mount Sinai (did not receive the Light, called the Torah, and were %0a%3c not corrected by it), i.e., have not yet rid themselves of the serpent's impurity %0a%3c (have neither revealed all the impure egoistic desires within them nor recognized %0a%3c them as evil). Nevertheless, other altruistic desires have the power to elevate him %0a%3c to the level of Supernal purity. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs through raising MAN, by evoking the great Zivug of ZON (where %0a%3c the Wings of Shechina rule and cover the Light of this Zivug). We can also elevate %0a%3c the outsider's soul (his yet uncorrected desires) to that level and sanctify it in the %0a%3c Light of this Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c And although this soul is not yet completely pure, it can receive the Light %0a%3c from this Zivug, for the wings protect it and do not allow its Light through %0a%3c to the impure forces (desires), even though they are very close to it. And it %0a%3c is said, UNDER THE WINGS OF SHECHINA, for this soul can receive the %0a%3c Light only from the wings of Malchut-Shechina, i.e., receive only the small, %0a%3c outer Light of Malchut. This is not the Light in the body of Malchut (Shechina) %0a%3c herself, let alone that of ZA (the Creator, Shochen). Rather, it is merely the %0a%3c Light of the Wings of Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The outsider's soul (his egoistic desires) can be corrected (made altruistic) %0a%3c only during the great Zivug, for only then is the Light protected by the Wings %0a%3c of Shechina. Hence, we (altruistic desires) must first raise MAN for the great %0a%3c Zivug, and receive its Light in our souls (desires corrected by the screen). Then, %0a%3c the Shechina spreads her wings, protects this Zivug, and takes the outsider's soul %0a%3c under them. It follows that initially, we elevate the outsider's soul with the help %0a%3c of our MAN, and then the Shechina takes it under her wings. %0a%3c %0a%3c 229. One might say that the soul of Haya exists in Israel and is ready for %0a%3c anything. He specified, "After its kind," which refers to both Israel and to an %0a%3c outsider. Like chambers and passages between them, the same exists in the %0a%3c land called Haya, under the wings. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eighth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 423 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar tells us that although the new soul (the corrected properties %0a%3c called the "outsider") receives the Light, just like the properties called "Israel," %0a%3c Israel receives from the inner Light, whereas the outsider receives from the %0a%3c outer. It was already mentioned that wings designate the Light of VAK, received %0a%3c during the great Zivug, but from the previous state of Katnut, so as to cover the %0a%3c Light of the great Zivug. %0a%3c %0a%3c This VAK includes Sefirot HGT NHY, where HGT are called "chambers," in %0a%3c which one can abide and sit (sitting means Katnut as opposed to standing, which %0a%3c is Gadlut). The Sefirot NHY are called "passages," entrances to the chambers, and %0a%3c it is impossible to sit there; their only role is to allow access to the chambers. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this lies in the property of Tifferet, the main Sefira in HGT. %0a%3c Tifferet is their middle line, a complete Kli for the reception of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c And the main Sefira in NHY is Yesod, which constitutes their middle line. It %0a%3c contains no property of the receiving Kli, and is used only for passing the %0a%3c Light onto Malchut, for the creation of the Returning Light. Hence, NHY are %0a%3c called "entrances." %0a%3c %0a%3c As for the outsiders (to purify from egoistic desires) from the seventy nations %0a%3c of the world (seventy egoistic properties), the chambers in HGT of the wings, %0a%3c as well as the passages in NHY of the wings are prepared for them. They receive %0a%3c Ohr Ne/esh from the passages (NHY) and Ohr Ruach from the chambers (HGT). %0a%3c %0a%3c 230. The right wing of Malchut has two passages, which are split from this %0a%3c wing in two so as to let in two nations that are close to Israel. And under the %0a%3c left wing there are two additional passages, called Amon and Moav. And they %0a%3c are all called the souls of Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Previously, The Zohar mentioned that there are many entrances-passages, %0a%3c yet now it speaks of only two. This is because it speaks in general: there are two %0a%3c entrances for the nations belonging to the right line, and two entrances for the %0a%3c nations belonging to the left line. There are also two nations in all of the right %0a%3c line, which include all the nations of the right side, and there are two nations of %0a%3c the left line, which include all the nations of the left side. %0a%3c %0a%3c The nations of the right side refer to the two general passages in the right %0a%3c wing. And The Zohar does not reveal what these nations are. And as for the %0a%3c nations of the left side, generally called "Amon and Moav," there are two passages %0a%3c in the left wing that are meant for them. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the souls of the outsiders that come from all the nations are collectively %0a%3c called Ne/esh Ha^a, for they can receive only from the great Zivug of ZON when %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 424 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON are inside AVI. Thus, Malchut is called Nefesh Haya, for she receives Ohr %0a%3c Haya from AVI. And since the souls (Nefashot) of the outsiders receive from the %0a%3c wings of Nefesh Haya, they are named after the received Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c 231. Each wing contains a multitude of closed chambers and halls. From %0a%3c them, spirits emerge and are divided among all the outsiders, called Ne/esH %0a%3c Haya, but each "after his kind." And they all come under the wings of the %0a%3c Shechina, but no further. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each wing includes VAK (HGT NHY), called "passages" and "chambers." %0a%3c Each nation has its own chamber in HGT and its own passage in NHY. Each %0a%3c receives Ne/esh in the passages and Ruach in the chambers. It is written that the %0a%3c chambers are closed, since HGT de VAK have only Ohr Hassadim without any %0a%3c Ohr Hochma; hence, they are called "closed." %0a%3c %0a%3c 232. However, the soul of Israel stems from the body of that tree (ZA), and %0a%3c from there the souls fly off to this land (Malchut). Therefore, Israel is the %0a%3c darling son of Malchut, and is sustained by her womb, and not by the wings %0a%3c that are on the outside of the body. Moreover, the outsiders have no part in %0a%3c the Holy Tree (ZA), especially not in its body. They refer only to the wings %0a%3c of Malchut, and no further. The outsider's place is under the wings of the %0a%3c Shechina, and no further. The righteous among the outsiders also refer to %0a%3c the outer side, and not to the inner. It is hence written: LET THE EARTH %0a%3c BRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL (Ne/esH Haya) AFTER ITS KIND. All %0a%3c receive Ne/esH from that Haya, but each according to its kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA is referred to as the "Tree of Life" and his Nulcva is called the "Land of %0a%3c Life." For in the state of Gadlut, they both ascend and clothe AVI, who have Ohr %0a%3c Haya (the Light of Life). Therefore, it is said that the soul of Israel stems from %0a%3c the body of that tree, meaning from ZA himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the souls from that tree fly off to the Land of Life: as a result of a Zivug %0a%3c between the tree (ZA) and the land (Malchut), ZA gives the souls of Israel into %0a%3c Nukva, and Israel receives these souls from her, as opposed to the outsiders, who %0a%3c receive their souls from the wings of Malchut, but not from Malchut herself, not %0a%3c from what ZA passed to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Nukva has three Partzufim, which clothe one %0a%3c another. They are called Ibur (embryo), Yenika (nursing), and Mochin (adulthood, %0a%3c Gadlut). The big (Mochin) Partzuf is the innermost of the three, and is clothed by %0a%3c Partzuf Yenika, which is in turn clothed by Ibur. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eighth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 425 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Israel receives from the innermost Partzuf (Gadlut of Nukva); hence, it is %0a%3c called the "darling son," for it stems from the inner part of Malchut, and not %0a%3c from her outer part (wings). %0a%3c %0a%3c NHY de Malchut are called "womb," for it is the place where the souls of %0a%3c Israel are conceived and grown. However, this does not refer to the NHY of %0a%3c the two outer Partzufim, called Vour and Yenika, as they are the wings of the %0a%3c Shechina-Malchut. Here The Zohar refers to the NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, the %0a%3c innermost Partzuf (the womb of Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is what the words of the prophet refer to: "Is Ephraim a darling son %0a%3c unto Me? Is he a child that is dandled? For as often as I speak of him, I do %0a%3c earnestly remember him still; therefore, My heart yearns for him, I will surely %0a%3c have compassion upon him" (Yirmiyahu, 31:19). Because the souls of Israel stem %0a%3c from the inner part of Malchut, The Zohar says that they appeared from Malchut's %0a%3c womb, from NHY of the Partzuf in Gadlut, and not from NHY of the two outer %0a%3c Partzufim, called "wings." %0a%3c %0a%3c The outsiders (desires for correction) have no part in the Supernal Tree, %0a%3c especially not in its body. Their place is under the wings of the Shechina, and no %0a%3c further. The outsiders that come (to correct themselves) are called righteous, for %0a%3c the Shechina is also called the "righteous one." They come under her wings and %0a%3c unite within her. Yet, they have no place above the Shechina, and receive from %0a%3c Ne/esh Haya, from a Zivug of Malchut with ZA in Gadlut. But they only receive the %0a%3c portion of the Light called "wings"; hence, they are said to be under the wings %0a%3c of the Shechina, where each receives according to his properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ninth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 233. The ninth Mitzva is to show mercy to the needy and supply them with %0a%3c food, as it is written: LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR %0a%3c LIKENESS, and this man will consist of two parts, male and female. IN OUR %0a%3c IMAGE refers to the rich; AFTER OUR LIKENESS refers to the poor. %0a%3c %0a%3c 234. For from the male side, they are rich, but from the female side, they are %0a%3c poor. And as they are united together, merciful to each other, and help each %0a%3c other, so below should the rich and the poor be united as one, and should %0a%3c share with each other, and show mercy to one another. %0a%3c %0a%3c 235. We see this in the book of King Shlomo (Solomon): he who shows %0a%3c mercy to the poor with all his heart, his image never differs from that of %0a%3c Adam, the first man. And since he was created in the image of Adam, he %0a%3c therefore governs all the creatures on earth by his image, as it is written: %0a%3c "And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the %0a%3c earth" (Beresheet, 9:2), all fear that image, existing in him. For this Mitzva, %0a%3c to show mercy to the poor, is the most important of all the M.itzvot for %0a%3c elevating man to the image of Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c 236. How do we know this? From Nebuchadnezzar. Even though he dreamt %0a%3c a dream, as long as he had mercy upon the poor, that dream did not come %0a%3c true. However, as soon as he started looking badly upon the poor, his image %0a%3c changed at once, and he distanced from people. Hence, it is written, LET US %0a%3c MAKE MAN. It is said in the form as it was said of charity in another verse. %0a%3c Therefore, MAKE— is the same as charity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rich and the poor correspond to the male and the female principles, to %0a%3c ZA and his Nukva. However, there is nothing here that hints at the obligation of %0a%3c the rich to be merciful to the poor and provide for his needs. But this instruction %0a%3c differs from the rest in that in all the others, the Creator's command is separated %0a%3c %0a%3c 427 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 428 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the action that follows it, as it is written, AND THE CREATOR SAID: %0a%3c 'LET THERE BE LIGHT AND THERE WAS LIGHT;' and also, AND THE %0a%3c CREATOR SAID: 'LET THE WATERS BE GATHERED...' AND IT WAS SO; %0a%3c and so on in all the Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c And none of the other Mitzvot contain the Creator's instruction mixed with %0a%3c action. This is so because the entire creation originated from AVI, where Aba %0a%3c spoke and Ima acted— Aba gave the Light to Ima, and after he gave it to her, he %0a%3c started acting on it himself. For only with the property of Aba could creation %0a%3c not have manifested in action, as there are no boundaries in creation, in which %0a%3c actions could be revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Aba issues a command that designates the passage of Light from %0a%3c him to Ima. However, since this is merely a command, and not an action (like a %0a%3c force instead of an action), the future tense is used. The same language is used %0a%3c in the description of man's creation: AND THE CREATOR SAID, "LET US %0a%3c CREATE MAN." Note that the plural form is used: LET US CREATE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Before the creation of the world of Atzilut (called the world of correction), %0a%3c an action known as Shevirat HaKelim (the breaking of the vessels in the world %0a%3c of Nekudim) took place in the spiritual worlds. It is written: "The Creator %0a%3c kept creating and destroying worlds, until He created this world (Atzilut), and %0a%3c He told it to stop spreading below the boundaries in which it was created" %0a%3c (Beresheet Raba, 3:7). %0a%3c %0a%3c The breaking of the vessels was essential, for it was the only opportunity to %0a%3c mix the egoistic properties (desires) with the altruistic ones; after all, distance %0a%3c in the spiritual is determined by the disparity of properties (desires). And that %0a%3c is why egoism and altruism are infinitely remote from each other. Yet, if this %0a%3c is so, how can egoism possibly be corrected? How can such properties or even %0a%3c notions of the existence of altruistic desires be introduced to man? %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, to allow egoistic desires to be corrected, the Creator performed the %0a%3c breaking of the vessels— the striking impact between opposite desires, egoistic %0a%3c and altruistic. It is called "striking," for it is impossible to unite these desires by %0a%3c any means other than an "explosion." %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of this explosion, the altruistic, pure Kelim (desires) penetrated %0a%3c the egoistic, impure ones, and gave man an opportunity for free will and self- %0a%3c correction. After the destruction of the pure Kli and the descent of its parts into %0a%3c impurity, the world of Atzilut was formed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of all the mixed desires, the world of Atzilut selected only altruistic %0a%3c ones, attached them to itself, corrected them and filled them with Light. Out %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ninth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 429 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of these corrected parts, it made the worlds BYA with everything that exists %0a%3c within them. %0a%3c %0a%3c These corrections of the broken and mixed Kelim by the world of Atzilut %0a%3c are depicted in the first chapter of the Torah, which speaks of creation. It uses %0a%3c the instructions of exposing and separating the egoistic Kelim from the altruistic %0a%3c ones, as, for instance, in the following verses: AND THE CREATOR DIVIDED %0a%3c LIGHT FROM DARKNESS; THE CREATOR DIVIDED WATERS FROM %0a%3c DRY LAND; THE CREATOR DIVIDED DAY FROM NIGHT, and so forth. %0a%3c All these examples speak of the separation of the pure forces from the impure %0a%3c ones, of good from evil. And all that diverged became part of the pure system. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the entire act of creation is contained in the depiction of the first %0a%3c day of creation, in the words, LET THERE BE LIGHT, as this is when Light was %0a%3c separated from darkness. This is because, on the whole, purity is called "Light" %0a%3c and impurity is called "darkness." And all the other definitions of purity and %0a%3c impurity are only particular names designating their various manifestations. %0a%3c %0a%3c The world of Atzilut made only a partial correction: it only separated %0a%3c altruistic desires from egoistic desires, Light from darkness, and thus created %0a%3c the system of creation, described in the beginning of the Torah. However, this %0a%3c does not complete the correction, as darkness and impurity are simply detached %0a%3c from participating in creation, but remain utterly uncorrected. They are simply %0a%3c separated as an entirely unnecessary part, and this completely defies the perfection %0a%3c of the Creator, who created everything (including darkness) for His final goal. %0a%3c Moreover, correction ends specifically with the correction of darkness, as it is %0a%3c said: "Night shines as day; darkness as Light." (Tehilim, 139:12). %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct this, man was created containing everything, and consisting of %0a%3c all the properties of creation: from the absolute goodness to total evil. This %0a%3c enables man to execute the correction and achieve complete perfection. In other %0a%3c words, he must turn evil to good, bitter to sweet, and darkness to Light. As a %0a%3c result, death will disappear forever, and the Creator will manifest as the King of %0a%3c all creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, there is a great difference between the description of man's creation %0a%3c and that of all the other creatures and parts of creation. Here, the action itself %0a%3c was mixed with the instructions, for the instructions, descriptions come from %0a%3c Ima, not from Aba, who said, LET US CREATE MAN— together with Malchut %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that Malchut includes everything, for she also gives the %0a%3c Light of sustenance to the impure forces to keep them from disappearing from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 430 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the world, as, like all the other elements of creation, the impure forces cannot %0a%3c exist without Light, and immediately disappear. It is written in this regard: HER %0a%3c FEET DESCEND TO DEATH, for the impure forces receive a tiny spark of %0a%3c Light to sustain their existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Malchut is called Assiya (action), for she spreads and rules in the %0a%3c whole of creation. She is also called "darkness," for she shines with a spark of %0a%3c Light, to sustain the darkness and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when Ima unites with Malchut and their properties mix, she receives %0a%3c the properties of darkness, of which it is said: LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR %0a%3c IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS, for Light is called "image," and darkness is %0a%3c called "likeness." Indeed, after Ima mixes with Malchut, these two forces, IMAGE %0a%3c and LIKENESS, appear in her as well. As a result, man, who was created by her, %0a%3c contains these two forces— IMAGE and LIKENESS, too. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the phrase, LET US MAKE, it follows that Ima consists of two parts, %0a%3c male and female. Although Ima is a male part (giving is a male property), she is %0a%3c connected to Malchut. Besides, the male property suggests the presence of Light, %0a%3c while the property of Nukva (the female part) is poverty and darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Ima accepted Malchut as her partner with the purpose of creating %0a%3c man (accepted the properties of Malchut), she is now filled with poverty and %0a%3c darkness. It follows that man consists of the properties of Ima (wealth and Light), %0a%3c as well as of the properties of Malchut (poverty and darkness). %0a%3c %0a%3c And it is this precise combination of the properties of Ima and Malchut that %0a%3c enables man to correct Malchut, fill her with Light, and spread spiritual purity %0a%3c and holiness throughout the entire earth (Malchut). It is written that at the %0a%3c end of correction, "the Creator and His Name shall be one," for the darkness %0a%3c in Malchut will be transformed into Light, as in the male part, HaVaYaH. %0a%3c Everything will be as one in the male property, as it is said, "There will be no %0a%3c poor in your nation." %0a%3c %0a%3c This Mitzva says that as Ima united with Malchut so as to correct her, which %0a%3c is why Ima includes Image and Likeness, man needs to correct his qualities in %0a%3c order to correct the parts of darkness within him. To this end, he must diminish %0a%3c his properties, just like Ima, and give his part (charity) to the poor Malchut, who %0a%3c is deprived of Light. He must show mercy to the LIKENESS (poverty) within %0a%3c him, and provide it with everything it needs. %0a%3c %0a%3c By observing this Mitzva, man receives IMAGE and LIKENESS from Ima, %0a%3c the Upper Light that was received by Adam, created in IMAGE and LIKENESS. %0a%3c This is why he has the power to rule over all the animals in the world (all of his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Ninth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 431 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c animal desires) to such an extent that no impure force (desire) remains within %0a%3c him, which he cannot defeat and correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar gives the example of Navuchadnetzar (Nebuchadnezzar): although %0a%3c the Supreme verdict with regard to him was reached, his dream did not come %0a%3c true as long as he was merciful to the poor. However, as soon as he allowed his %0a%3c evil eye to look badly upon the poor, the sentence was immediately executed, %0a%3c and his image changed (those who are interested can turn to The Book of Daniel). %0a%3c Thus we see that this Mitzva is greater than all the others, and that it can overrule %0a%3c the Supreme verdict made against man. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Charity" signifies the union of Bina and Malchut. Similarly, the story %0a%3c about the marriage of Rut (Ruth) the Moavite, King David's grandmother %0a%3c (Malchut), and Boaz, who was merciful to her (this marriage started Israel's %0a%3c Royal Dynasty), describes the correction of Malchut by Bina (See Megilat Rut— %0a%3c The Book of Ruth). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 237. The tenth Mitzva obliges man to put on Tefillin and to attain the Supernal %0a%3c properties, as it is written, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN %0a%3c IMAGE. He opened and said, "Your head upon you is like the Carmel." This %0a%3c text refers to the Supernal head— the Tefillin worn on the head of the Holy, %0a%3c Supernal King HdVaYaH, written in separate letters. Each letter in the holy %0a%3c name HdVaYaH corresponds to a certain paragraph in the Tefillin. Thus, the %0a%3c Holy, Supernal Name is written in the scrolls of Tefillin, in the secrets of the %0a%3c letters. For THE NAME OF THE CREATOR IS UPON YOU, AND THEY %0a%3c SHALL BE AFRAID OF YOU refers to the head Tefillin, which contains the %0a%3c Holy Name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c By being merciful to the poor, one merely begins to receive the Creator's %0a%3c Supernal image. Bina absorbs the properties of Malchut, described by the verse, %0a%3c LET US CREATE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, AFTER OUR LIKENESS. By %0a%3c unifying Bina's properties with those of Malchut, AHP de Bina (the letters ELEH) %0a%3c fell to ZON, and only the letters MI (GE) remained in Ima. AHP de Bina that %0a%3c fell to ZON consist of Aba and Ima: Aba assumes the properties of ZA, and Ima %0a%3c assumes the properties of Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since AVI descended to the place of ZON, they became like ZON. And from %0a%3c them ZON receive the state of Katnut, called TZELEM Elokim, likeness to Bina %0a%3c (VAK), for Ima lost the GAR of her own state, that is, since her AHP fell to ZON, %0a%3c she lost the Light of GAR (see diagram on next page). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, only the letters MI = GE = K-H remained in Ima, whereas her %0a%3c B-ZA-M = AHP = ELEH fell to ZON. Thus, of the five Lights NRNHY that were %0a%3c inside Ima, she retained only Ohr Ruach in Keter and Ohr Ne/esh in Hochma. %0a%3c Thus, Ima can only give ZON the Light of VAK = Ruach + Nefesh, but not the %0a%3c Light of GAR = NRNHY. Also, ZON are considered to have acquired likeness to %0a%3c %0a%3c 433 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 434 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Upper One only upon receiving the Lights NRNHY. And this is achieved by %0a%3c the fulfillment of the Mitzva of Tefillin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Light of %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaya %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, a question arises: we have already learned that to create the Partzuf of %0a%3c lower man out of ZON, ZON must ascend to AVI and receive the Light of GAR, %0a%3c for a small Partzuf without Ohr Hochma cannot beget. So why is it said that Ima %0a%3c is in a state of Katnutl %0a%3c %0a%3c When ZON attain reception of the Light of AVI, they thereby ascend to AVI %0a%3c and become similar to AVI in their properties, for each lower one that ascends %0a%3c to the Upper One becomes like it. Indeed, only the magnitude of the screen %0a%3c distinguishes between spiritual objects, as only the magnitude of the screen %0a%3c determines all of the object's properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, upon ascending and clothing AVI, ZON become like AVI, and all the %0a%3c properties of AVI are now naturally adopted by ZON. Just as AVI create ZON, %0a%3c ZON in AVI beget and pass the Light into the Partzuf of lower man. Hence, there %0a%3c is no need to even change names, for everything occurs at the degree of AVI. %0a%3c And upon ascending there, ZON are already called AVI, and the Light that they %0a%3c pass to man is regarded as the Light intended for ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written: THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. %0a%3c The Hebrew word "image" that is used in the Torah is T?eLeM, and is formed by %0a%3c three letters: Tzadi-Lamed-Mem. In item 2, we said that there are no Kelim for Ohr %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 435 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya and Yechida; rather, there are only Kelirn Bina-ZA-Malchut for the Lights %0a%3c NRN: 'Nefesh-Ruach-Neshama. %0a%3c %0a%3c So even when we say that there is a Kli called Keter, we imply that the %0a%3c count starts with Bina de Keter, not with Keter de Keter. Bina and ZON, the %0a%3c Kelim that remained in the Partzuf, are divided into three lines: the line of %0a%3c Bina—HBD, the line of ZA-HGT, and the line of Malchut— NHYM. This is %0a%3c characteristic of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Daat Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura - Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Hod - Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when Ohr Hochma is transferred, Partzuf Bina divides into two %0a%3c Partzufim: AVI and YESHSUT. These constitute HBD = three and HGT = three. %0a%3c Along with ZAT = seven Sefirot, from Hesed to Malchut, and form the Gematria %0a%3c of thirteen (3 + 3 + 7) of the word Echad, which alludes to the complete name, %0a%3c state, and attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that Sefirot Keter and Hochma are concealed in AA, and only its %0a%3c Sefira Bina sends her Light down. This Sefira Bina de AA is divided into two Partzufim, %0a%3c AVI and YESHSUT: her GAR shines in AVI and her ZAT shines in YESHSUT %0a%3c These two parts of Bina are called M (Mem) and L (Lamed) of the word T^eLeM: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. AVI are called M of the word TzeLeM, as they form a closed ring %0a%3c guarding Ohr Hochma, preventing it from reaching the other, lower %0a%3c Partzufim. This Ohr Hochma is referred to as "concealed" (from all the %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut), and only Ohr Hassadim, Ohr Ruach, %0a%3c descends from them to all the Partzufim of the world of Atzilut during %0a%3c the 6,000 years until the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. YESHSUT is called L of the word TzeLeM, as it bows its head (GAR) %0a%3c and resembles a tower. It is written about this tower: "The Tower of %0a%3c Oz (strength) of the Creator's name." This is because YESHSUT is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 436 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c called a "tower," and ZA is known as the "righteous one." After all, %0a%3c YESHSUT is ZAT de Bina, the properties of ZON that are included in %0a%3c Bina; hence, it passes its Ohr Hochma to ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c If ZON in Katnut are filled with Ohr Hassadim (Ruach called Avir— air), then %0a%3c during the reception of Ohr Hochma from YESHSUT, the letter Yod in the word %0a%3c Avir exits, and Avir turns into Ohr (Light). Hence, YESHSUT is called a "tower," %0a%3c i.e., a Partzuf in Gadlut that contains Hochma, soaring in the air (Avir). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this state in ZON is inconstant. YESHSUT intermittently returns %0a%3c to Katnut and to Gadlut; therefore, such a state is called "soaring." ZA is called %0a%3c Tz (Tzadi) of the word T^eLeM, for such is his property inside this tower. Thus: %0a%3c %0a%3c - AVI— M (Mem)— Hochma that is concealed inside a ring. %0a%3c %0a%3c - YESHSUT— L (Lamed)— Bina, though as she ascends to AA, she becomes %0a%3c Hochma (tower) and passes Ohr Hochma down. %0a%3c %0a%3c - ZON— Tz (Tzadi)— Daat, receives the Light from YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one should not confuse the three letters Tz-L-M with the three %0a%3c lines called HBD: T^eLeM consists of three Partzufim, one inside the other. %0a%3c Partzuf Hochma (M of the TzeLeM, AVI) is the innermost Partzuf; Partzuf Bina %0a%3c (YESHSUT, L of the TzeLeM) clothes it from Chazeh de AVI downward; and %0a%3c from Chazeh de YESHSUT downwards, Partzuf Bina is clothed by Partzuf Daat, %0a%3c ZA, Tz of the word TzeLeM. %0a%3c %0a%3c The words, THE CREATOR CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE %0a%3c (TzeLeM), mean that with the help of the spiritual observance of the Mitzva of %0a%3c Tefillin, Ohr Hochma is received in accordance with the ascending order of the %0a%3c letters Tz-L-M. This is the Light that Adam received after his creation, whereas we %0a%3c first stimulate the reception of this Light in ZON, and from ZON we stimulate %0a%3c its reception into ourselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE HEAD TEFILLIN CONTAINS THE NAME OF THE HOLY KING, %0a%3c INSCRIBED IN THE LETTERS HaVaYaH-the head Tefillin is the name of %0a%3c the Supernal King, inscribed in the letters HaVaYaH. The Tefillin are called the %0a%3c Carmel (Car Maleh-all goodness), as it is written: YOUR HEAD UPON YOU %0a%3c IS LIKE THE CARMEL. This is because when the heads of ZA and Malchut put %0a%3c on the head Tefillin (the Upper Light of TzeLeM), they become like the Carmel %0a%3c (Car Maleh— all goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light is called "The name of the Supernal, Holy King," the four %0a%3c letters of HaVaYaH, where each letter is written separately: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey . %0a%3c And the reason why man feels that the letters are written separately is that each %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 437 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf contains the four letters of HaVaYaH, and each of them designates an %0a%3c independent Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every letter constitutes a separate passage on the parchment (in the %0a%3c Tefillin); four separate passages correspond to the four letters of HaVaYaH. A %0a%3c passage (Hebrew— Parashah) represents a separate and complete Partzuf, and its %0a%3c corresponding letter in HaVaYaH symbolizes the Light in this Partzuf. The order %0a%3c of Partzufim corresponds to the order of the letters of HaVaYaH: Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a%3c Hey. Such a Tefillin is called the Tefillin of Rashi. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, there is a Tefillin with the order of passages (Partzufim) Yod-Hey- %0a%3c Hey-Vav, called Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn. The passages that are written on fragments %0a%3c of parchment are identical, but the order of putting them into the boxes of %0a%3c Tefillin Rabeinu Tarn is different: Yod-Hey-Hey-Vav. %0a%3c %0a%3c 238. The first passage in the Tefillin corresponds to the letter Yod of the %0a%3c name HaVaYaH (Hochma) and refers to the Mitzva, "Sanctify to Me all the %0a%3c firstborn." This is because Hochma is the firstborn of all the Supernal Ones. %0a%3c It opens the place of conception for the future firstborn with the help of %0a%3c a thin line of Light that emanates from Yod, which opens the womb and %0a%3c impregnates it. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI are designated by the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH, where Yod %0a%3c signifies Aba and the filling of Yod (according to its pronunciation: Yod = Yod + %0a%3c Vav + Dalet), i.e., Vav + Dalet constitutes lma. Partzuf AVI is called "holy" and %0a%3c "first born," for Partzufim YESHSUT and ZON are called holy only when they %0a%3c receive holiness (Ohr Hochma) from AVI. All the holiness in the world of Atzilut %0a%3c comes from AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is so because Ohr Hochma is called "holiness" and AVI is Mem of the %0a%3c word T^eLeM (Hochma de Atzilut), for the Supernal Hochma of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c is concealed within them. AVI themselves are defined as Bina in the property %0a%3c of Hassadim, as Hochma is concealed within Rosh de AA, and the lower ones can %0a%3c receive it only if Bina ascends to Hochma, to Rosh de AA, where Bina unites with %0a%3c Hochma of Rosh de AA and assumes the name Hochma. However, she is not the %0a%3c ordinary Hochma; she is called "Hochma of the thirty-two paths" of descending %0a%3c Ohr Hochma, and only this Hochma bestows Ohr Hochma upon all the Partzufim %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why The Zohar says that this thin ray of Light, called the "path of %0a%3c Light," opens the womb and conceives the future offspring. Yod consists of three %0a%3c parts: (i) the upper "spike" of the letter Yod, a small line above the point, which %0a%3c is called Rosh and designates Partzuf AA that is concealed in AVI; (ii) the body of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 438 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Yod, which forms PartzufAVl; and (iii) the lower "spike" of the letter, which %0a%3c designates Yesod, the end of Partzuf AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Through the continuous Zivug between Yesod de Aba and Yesod de Ima, the %0a%3c great waters descend onto all the lower worlds with all that inhabits them. This %0a%3c Zivug on Ohr Hassadim is called a "Zivug that revives the worlds." Yesod de Ima %0a%3c is also called Rechem (womb), for all Rachamim (mercy) stems from this part of %0a%3c Its Partzuf. Yet, if AVI do not make a Zivug, this part of Ima is closed, and mercy %0a%3c does not descend below. Only Yesod de Aba can open Yesod de Ima, whereupon %0a%3c Ima passes her great waters to the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c 239. The second passage in the Tefillin, WHEN YOU COME, corresponds %0a%3c to the first letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH, the hall (Bind) that opens up %0a%3c under the influence of the letter Yod (Aba) in fifty entrances, passages, and %0a%3c chambers concealed within it. The revelation that Yod made in that hall was %0a%3c done so as to hear the voice of the Shofar (a ram's horn), Bind. The Shofar %0a%3c is closed on all sides, but the letter Yod came and opened it so that its sound %0a%3c could be heard. And since it opened the Shofar and derived sound from it, %0a%3c Yod led all to freedom. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Hey of the name HaVaYaH is YESHSUT, L in the word TzeLeM. It %0a%3c is called a "tower soaring in the air," a hall with fifty entrances, for the concealed %0a%3c AVI are designated by the M of TzeLeM, by the ring that surrounds Ohr Hochma %0a%3c and prevents it from shining outside. And they shine only with Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, by rising to Rosh de AA, where Bina turns into Hochma, YESHSUT %0a%3c can pass Ohr Hochma to ZON. Bina, who turns into Hochma in order to receive %0a%3c Hochma for ZON, is called the "fifty gates of Bina," for she consists of five Sefirot %0a%3c KHB-ZA-M, ten in each. Each of these fifty Sefirot consists of a chamber and %0a%3c an entrance: HGT are called a "chamber" and NHY are called an "entrance," %0a%3c a "passage," implying the absence of a Kli for reception. Instead, it serves for %0a%3c transferring the Light into, or out of the chamber. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the second passage used in the Tefillin: AND WHEN YOU %0a%3c COME designates the letter Hey in the name HaVaYaH, YESHSUT of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut, which ascends to accept Ohr Hochma and pass it on to ZON below. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod opened this hall so as to hear the voice that comes from the ram's horn, %0a%3c for this horn is closed on all sides. As was already mentioned, YESHSUT (Bina) %0a%3c united with Malchut by lowering her three Sefirot ELEH (Bina and ZON) to %0a%3c ZON, while YESHSUT remained with only two Sefirot KH, MI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, as a result of raising MAN, Malchut descends from the Eynaim (eyes), the %0a%3c Eynaim of YESHSUT open up, Malchut descends to her own place in the Peh, and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 439 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the three letters ELEH reunite with MI to form the name ELOKIM. GE = KH de %0a%3c ZON ascend to Bina along with these ELEH. However, although ELEH ascended %0a%3c and joined MI, the name ELOKIM is still considered closed, for it has only Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, and Ohr Hochma cannot shine in ELEH without Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c These three letters ELEH are therefore defined as a horn (Shofar), and ZON %0a%3c that ascended to Bina along with ELEH are concealed within them. And these %0a%3c ZON in ELEH are referred to as a "voice." This voice sounds in the hall with the %0a%3c help of the letter Yod, for Yod designates AVI that bestow the Light from Above, %0a%3c which facilitates the lowering of Malchut from Nikvey Eynaim de YESHSUT to %0a%3c her place in the Peh, and raising ELEH back to Bina. Hence, Yod opens up the %0a%3c hall of Light in YESHSUT in order to pass this Light to ZON from the Shofar %0a%3c (the ascended letters ELEH). %0a%3c %0a%3c ZON, too, ascend to Bina along with ELEH and there receive Hochma. This %0a%3c great Light in ZA is called a "voice," and its reception is known as "listening to %0a%3c the voice." However, this horn is closed on all sides, on the sides of Hochma and %0a%3c Hassadim, for the letters ELEH (called a "horn") fall to ZON, where they remain %0a%3c closed and inaccessible both to Ohr Hochma and to Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, two corrections are needed: (i) to elevate and unite them %0a%3c with Bina, enabling them to once more attain their Ohr Hochma; (ii) to provide %0a%3c them with Ohr Hassadim so it can serve as a garment for Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c First, Yod (AVI) pass the Light to Hey (YESHSUT), whereupon ELEH rise %0a%3c above Malchut, to Bina, together with ZON, and there receive Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c However, this Ohr Hochma is called concealed or closed, for it cannot shine %0a%3c without being clothed in Ohr Hassadim. This means that the voice has not yet %0a%3c emerged— ZA has not yet been born. %0a%3c %0a%3c After that, Yod enters into the word Light = Ohr; hence, it turns into Avir %0a%3c = air (Ohr Hassadim). And since the horn (the letters ELEH) received air (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), they can beget ZA (the voice of the Shofar), for being clothed in Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim, Ohr Hochma can enter ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The general Light that ZA receives is called "voice." And this voice frees %0a%3c all the slaves that were enslaved by the egoistic desires in all the worlds, for ZA %0a%3c shines down on all the lower ones. Thus, the sons of Israel (man's spiritual %0a%3c aspirations) merit the Light of deliverance (defeat the earthly, egoistic ones). %0a%3c %0a%3c 240. At the sounds of the Shofar, the sons of Israel were delivered from Egypt. %0a%3c And so shall the Shofar be blown in the future, the next time at the end of %0a%3c days. And all deliverance originates from this Shofar, which is Bina. This is %0a%3c why the deliverance from Egypt is mentioned in this chapter of the Torah, for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 440 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c this Shofar stems from the force of the letter Yod, which opens the womb and %0a%3c delivers the captives to freedom. And this is the letter Hey, the second letter %0a%3c of the name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the Light in ZON comes from the horn (ELEH), including the great %0a%3c Light that delivers Israel from Egypt, and the Light that is destined to be revealed %0a%3c in the future, at the end of days (complete deliverance from egoism). This is why %0a%3c the Tefillin contain a passage that refers to the exodus from Egypt, for the Light %0a%3c delivering from Egypt comes from the horn, which is inside YESHSUT. This is %0a%3c done by the power of AVI, called Yod de HaVaYaH, which open the womb of %0a%3c YESHSUT (ELEH) and free the voice (ZA) from its captivity. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Light has sufficient power to deliver Israel from slavery. Only after the %0a%3c attainment of this Light (Ohr Haya), and not a degree lower, can ZA and Nukva %0a%3c be called "voice" and "speech." All deliverance comes only from Ohr Haya (only %0a%3c upon ascending the spiritual degree of Ohr Haya can man liberate himself from %0a%3c egoism and become free). %0a%3c %0a%3c 241. The third passage in the Tefillin is the secret of the Unity in "Hear O %0a%3c Israel," the letter Vav in HaVaYaH, which includes all and designates ZA, %0a%3c who contains the unity of all. Everything merges in unity within him, and %0a%3c he receives all. The fourth passage that reads, "You shall hear," includes two %0a%3c sides, Hesed and Qevura, which unite with the Assembly of Israel, called %0a%3c the lower Qevura or Malchut. And this is the last letter Hey of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, which takes and includes them all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third passage in the Tefillin (Hear O Israel) is Partzuf ZA, the letter Vav %0a%3c in HaVaYaH, which includes all four passages contained in the Tefillin. Although %0a%3c the first two passages (AVI and YESHSUT) represent Hochma and Bina, they do %0a%3c not really constitute Hochma and Bina themselves, but rather, their part, which %0a%3c clothes in Rosh de ZON, called M and L of TZeLeM de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the fourth passage, Malchut of ZA, does not imply that this is %0a%3c Malchut herself. Rather, it refers to her part that is included in ZA and is called %0a%3c Mochin (brain) de Gevura. There are three parts of Mochin in ZA: Hochma, Bina, %0a%3c and Daat, which are accordingly called M, L and Tz of T^eLeM de ZA. They are %0a%3c the same HB-ZA-M as in Mochin de ZA. This is because Daat (Tz) includes Hesed %0a%3c and Gevura. And this Hesed in Daat is defined as ZA himself, and Gevura is %0a%3c defined as the inclusion (of the properties) of Nukva in ZA. And these H-B-ZA-M %0a%3c constitute the four passages contained in the Tefillin. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why ZA, the letter Vav in the name HaVaYaH, includes all four %0a%3c passages. And all the unions that come from AVI and YESHSUT are done within %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 441 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him, i.e., for his sake. For all the Higher Partzufim that precede ZA are united %0a%3c (with the Creator), and need no MAN from the lower ones to reach the state of %0a%3c unity. Whereas all the MAN raised by the lower ones to the Upper Partzufim are %0a%3c meant solely for the unification of ZA, and in no way affect the constant unity %0a%3c of the Higher Partzufim with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The unification of Hochma with Bina, as a result of which Bina becomes %0a%3c like Hochma, occurs only on account of ZA being raised to Bina in the form of %0a%3c MAN. For when ZA is raised to Bina as MAN, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA and %0a%3c there receives Hochma for ZA. Since Bina aspires only to mercy (Ohr Hassadim), %0a%3c she never receives Ohr Hochma for the Creator's sake, but only if the lower ones %0a%3c are in need of it. Her role, her properties are only to bestow, and not to receive. %0a%3c (Note that in the spiritual, "reception" is always for the Creator's sake.) %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Bina ascends to Rosh de AA only for the sake of ZON. And it is ZA %0a%3c alone that ascends to Bina and stimulates her to ascend to Rosh de AA, where she %0a%3c makes a Zivug with Hochma and passes this Light to him. It is therefore said that %0a%3c ZA receives all, as Bina passes everything that she receives in Rosh de AA to him. %0a%3c And Ohr Hochma is revealed only in the place of ZA (not Bina), as he descends %0a%3c back to his place below Chazeh de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer "Hear O Israel" designates ZA, the letter Vav of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, the Supernal unity (item 207) that reveals love only from the good %0a%3c side. And since it refers only to "Love your Creator...," it contains no restrictions %0a%3c or strictness of judgment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, in the fourth passage, "You shall hear," the last Hey of the name %0a%3c HaVaYaH, Nukva de ZA that is included in him, Gevura in Rosh de ZA, reveals %0a%3c both sides of love— good, as well as evil (item 206), reflected in the words of this %0a%3c passage. It ends with the words: "Blessed be His great name for ever and ever," %0a%3c which corresponds to the inclusion and unity of Nukva in ZA, meaning not %0a%3c Nukt/a herself, but her part in ZA, i.e., Mochin de Daat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura in Daat is the second Hey in HaVaYaH. It accepts all the Light of %0a%3c the Supernal unity contained in "Hear O Israel," and includes all. And since it %0a%3c contains all the perfection of unity, it reveals all the Light and both sides of love, %0a%3c for the property of judgment that complements love to perfection exists only %0a%3c within it, and not Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written: "Your head upon you is like the Carmel, " des ignating %0a%3c the head Tefillin. Indeed, after ZA is clothed in all four Lights, designated by %0a%3c the four paragraphs of the Tefillin, which are the three letters Tz, L, and M of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 442 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the word T^eLeM, his head is defined as the Carmel (Car Maleh— completely %0a%3c filled with goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c 242. Tefillin are the letters of the holy name. Therefore, "Your head upon %0a%3c you is like the Carmel" refers to the head Tefillin. The letter Dcdet refers to %0a%3c the hand Tefillin, Malchut, who is depleted of Light, compared to the head %0a%3c Tefillin, ZA, but she contains the perfection of the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c The hand Tefillin designates Malchut. And she is poor in comparison with %0a%3c Bina, the Upper World. Yet, she has her own perfection, for she now receives it %0a%3c from Bina thanks to the unity between Nukva and ZA in "Blessed be His great %0a%3c name for ever and ever." %0a%3c %0a%3c And since she is not the Nukva that is included in ZA (his body), but a %0a%3c separate Nukva of ZA, she takes all four passages from him, H-B-ZA-M of ZA, for %0a%3c she has a separate, complete Partzuf. However, these four passages of the Torah %0a%3c are in the same place; they are not separated from each other by partitions, as %0a%3c in the Tefillin of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that a passage of the Torah is the Light, and the place %0a%3c where it dwells is a Kli (the Tefillin in our world is a box made of a "pure" animal's %0a%3c skin, into which four parchment scrolls are placed, and the corresponding %0a%3c passages from the Torah are written on each). As we know, every Zivug emanates %0a%3c Light. Since ZA receives four Lights H-B-H-G in four Kelim, as a result of four %0a%3c Zivugim, he contains four compartments for four passages, each compartment %0a%3c containing a particular passage from the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, no Zivug is made on Malchut herself. Everything that Malchut has, %0a%3c she receives from ZA. Malchut receives all four Lights (four passages from the %0a%3c Torah that result from one Zivug with ZA); hence, she has only one place for all %0a%3c four passages (Lights). %0a%3c %0a%3c 243. "The King is held captive in the tubs" means that he is tied down and held %0a%3c in those four compartments of the Tefillin for the purpose of being properly %0a%3c united with that holy name. And he who makes this correction, exists in image %0a%3c and likeness, TZELEM, with the Creator. Just as the holy name is united in %0a%3c the Creator, the holy name is united in him. "Male and female he created %0a%3c them" refers to the head and the hand Tefillin. And it is one. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The King is held captive in the tubs" signifies ZA, who is bound and %0a%3c unified in those compartments of the Tefillin. The compartments of the Tefillin, %0a%3c which contain the passages from the Torah, are called "tubs" or "troughs," just %0a%3c like the tubs from which sheep drink water, for the waters of Ohr Hochma and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Tenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 443 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohr Hassadim are bound and restricted by these Kelim, the compartments of the %0a%3c Tefillin. And it is the Creator who is bound tight and held in these Kelim, so as %0a%3c to be unified in the holy name. %0a%3c %0a%3c The compartments of the Tefillin are the TNHY of Tvuna, the lower part of %0a%3c YESHSUT (Israel-Saba and Tvuna, where Israel-Saba is the male part and Tvuna %0a%3c is the female). This part of Tvuna is called the big letter Dalet of the word Echad %0a%3c (one) in the verse, "Hear O Israel, our Creator is one." It is written about this %0a%3c letter: "Let the dry land appear." %0a%3c %0a%3c As was already mentioned in the third Mitzva, because this "dry land" was %0a%3c revealed in ZA, he can pass the Light to Malchut. Thus, were it not for these four %0a%3c places in ZA, the dry land within him, he would have been unable to give the %0a%3c Light to Nukva. Hence, it is said that ZA "is tied down and held in those places" %0a%3c that stem from dry land so as to enable him to unite and pass the revelation of %0a%3c the Creator's Light into the holy name, Nukva. As a result, the dry land becomes %0a%3c fertile and produces fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, he who has completed the corrections of these four passages %0a%3c from the Torah acquires the image and likeness (T^eLeM) of the Creator. In %0a%3c other words, when man "below" (below the world of Atzilut, in the worlds BYA) %0a%3c "puts on" the Tefillin (attains the level of this degree), he receives the Light of H- %0a%3c B-H-G from ZA. This Light is called TzeLeM, since Hochma and Bina are called M %0a%3c and L, whereas Hesed and Gevura are called Tz. And just like Elokim, Bina unites %0a%3c with the holy name of Malchut, thereby uniting the holy name within man, for %0a%3c man is a part of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two parts— male and female— in the Light of Hochma and Bina %0a%3c (called TzeLeM): TzeLeM of ZA and TzeLeM of Nukva, the head Tefillin and the %0a%3c hand Tefillin. Hence, it is said that the Creator created a man and a woman, %0a%3c referring to the head Tefillin and the hand Tefillin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eleventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 244. The eleventh Mitzva is to give a tithe of the fruits of the earth. Here %0a%3c there are two M.itzvoU to separate a tithe of the fruits of the earth, and to %0a%3c bring the first fruits of the trees, as it is written, "Behold, I have given you %0a%3c every herb-yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth" (Beresheet, %0a%3c 1:29). Here it is written, I HAVE GIVEN YOU. Elsewhere it is written, "And %0a%3c to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel" (Bamidbar, %0a%3c 18:21). It is also written, "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of %0a%3c the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Creator's" (Vayikra, 27:30). %0a%3c %0a%3c These verses say that the Creator gave everything to Adam. Yet, why does %0a%3c that oblige us to separate a tithe, to bring the first fruits of the earth, and why are %0a%3c we forbidden from eating them? After all, this contradicts the aforesaid. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the process of (spiritual) nourishment includes exposure, %0a%3c selection, and separation of the holy sparks of the Light from the impure forces. %0a%3c In the process of feeding (reception of Light), the sparks of the Light (Nitzotzin) %0a%3c that are contained in the food unite with man's soul, with his very flesh, and the %0a%3c waste, except for the sparks, leaves the body. This continues throughout man's %0a%3c life (6,000 degrees of ascent); he gradually accumulates within him all the holy %0a%3c sparks, with which he complements his soul. Without them, the soul cannot %0a%3c attain completeness and perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c I think that the reader already understands that The Zohar in no way speaks %0a%3c about the process of feeding, digestion, and secretion of our physical body. As %0a%3c the whole of the Torah, The Zohar speaks only of the goal of creation and the %0a%3c ways of its attainment. Therefore, I call upon the reader (in defiance of what his %0a%3c mind suggests to him after the first reading) to realize that these texts are written %0a%3c in the language of branches, when spiritual objects are described in the language %0a%3c of our world; yet, despite the corporeal language, the objects remain spiritual! %0a%3c %0a%3c 445 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 446 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in the weekly portion Lech Lecha that Adam was forbidden to %0a%3c eat meat: "I have given you every herb..." (Beresheet, 1:29). However, since Adam %0a%3c sinned, and egoism, impurity entered his body, it was said to Noah: "Every %0a%3c moving thing that lives shall be for food for you; as the green herb have I given %0a%3c you all" (Beresheet, 9:3), that is, including meat. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Adam was created in absolute perfection, everything was sorted and %0a%3c corrected within him, which corresponds to the animate part of creation, as it %0a%3c is written (Beresheet, 2:19): "Out of the ground the Creator formed every beast %0a%3c of the field," and also, "whatsoever the man would call every living creature, %0a%3c that was to be the name thereof." This means that Adam attained every name %0a%3c (spiritual level) of the animal souls, for the pure forces were already separated %0a%3c from the impure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Adam was not given the task of exposing, sorting, and correcting %0a%3c animals by eating them, for even before the creation of man, the Creator %0a%3c corrected this in the world of Atzilut. And only the inanimate and vegetative %0a%3c (parts of the soul) remained uncorrected, containing both pure and impure %0a%3c forces. Therefore, Adam was instructed to expose the sparks that his soul lacked %0a%3c in the inanimate and vegetative food. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, as a result of Adam's sin, pure and impure desires (forces) were %0a%3c mixed once more. And as Adam's soul was shattered into many parts, all %0a%3c of which fell into the impure forces, all the animals (animate desires) were %0a%3c corrupted along with him (with the human level of desire). Thus appeared the %0a%3c need to expose, sort, and correct them. Therefore, after the sin the Creator %0a%3c ordered Adam and the subsequent generations to eat animals, and thus extract %0a%3c the sparks from impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said that Adam was created IN THE IMAGE AND AFTER LIKENESS, %0a%3c i.e., with the help of the T^eLeM Elokim, the Light of Bina, by the four passages %0a%3c from the Torah in the Tefillin. And this is his soul. However, after he was born %0a%3c with this holy soul, thanks to his good deeds, he merited raising MAN and %0a%3c receiving Ohr Haya, and then, on Shabbat, attaining Ohr Yechida as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Adam was left to correct the creation with the help of only a tithe %0a%3c and offerings. And by feeding on tithe and offerings, he attained the revelation %0a%3c of his desires and raised MAN to the level of Ohr Haya and Yechida. Yet, after %0a%3c he sinned, all of his corrections and everything that had filled his soul was %0a%3c corrupted, mixed, and egoism took over the body. %0a%3c %0a%3c Due to our egoism, tithe and offerings are forbidden for us, for fear that we %0a%3c will desire Supernal purity. Instead, we are obliged to extract and pass them on %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Eleventh Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 447 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to the Cohanim and Levi'im (parts of the soul). And if we observe this Creator's %0a%3c Mitzva of spiritually separating a tithe of the fruits of the earth and the offerings %0a%3c (as He commanded), we will receive the strength to raise MAN and receive Ohr %0a%3c Haya on Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds is called Shabbat) in the same way that %0a%3c Adam attained this state while feeding on tithe and offerings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, after man receives Ohr Neshama by putting on the Tefillin, he can raise %0a%3c MAN with the help of the two Mitzvot (tithe and offerings) in order to receive %0a%3c Ohr Haya. As it is explained, Adam was receiving Ohr Haya by feeding on tithe %0a%3c and offerings. However, we are forbidden to feed on them (to try to receive %0a%3c this Light for the Creator's sake) because of the egoism that acts in our body %0a%3c (desires). Instead, we are bid to give a tithe and the offerings to the Cohanim and %0a%3c the Levi'im. As a result, we receive the strength to receive this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Twelfth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 245. The twelfth Mitzva is to bring the first fruits of the trees as an offering, %0a%3c as it is written, "And every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed" %0a%3c (Beresheet, 1:29). All that is worthy of Me shall not be eaten by you. I have %0a%3c given you My permission and I have given you all the tithe and offerings of the %0a%3c trees. "To you," and not to the subsequent generations. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid, it becomes clear that we, the subsequent generations, are %0a%3c forbidden to feed on tithe and offerings. The Light called "tithe" and "offerings" %0a%3c is so great that until all the Kelim (desires) of Adam's soul have been corrected, it %0a%3c is impossible to receive it for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is forbidden to even try, lest we sin, as it happened to Adam. There %0a%3c is a Mitzva to not receive this Light, which refers to Maichut de Malchut. Every %0a%3c time the sparks are revealed, it is sufficient to let this Light be, to refrain from %0a%3c receiving it during the 6,000 years. Herein lies its actual correction until, at the %0a%3c end of correction, the Creator's great Light, called Mashiach (Messiah), manifests %0a%3c and gives us the strength to receive tithe and offerings for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 449 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Thirteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 246. The thirteenth hlitzva is to perform the redemption of a first-born son so %0a%3c as to strengthen him in life. For there are two appointed angels in charge— one %0a%3c over life and one over death. And they both rule over man from Above. And %0a%3c when man redeems his son, he redeems him from the angel in charge of death, %0a%3c so that the angel can no longer govern the first-born son. Hence, it is written, %0a%3c AND THE CREATOR SAW EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD MADE-this %0a%3c is in general, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS... VERY GOOD alludes to the angel %0a%3c of life, while the word VERY alludes to the angel of death. Therefore, by this %0a%3c act of redemption, the angel of life is strengthened and the angel of death is %0a%3c weakened. Life is purchased by this redemption, for the evil side leaves him be %0a%3c and clings to him no more. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ascent of the worlds occurred on the sixth day of creation: ZA ascended %0a%3c to the place of AA, Malchut ascended to AVI, and Adam attained Ohr Haya. As %0a%3c a result, the angel of death (egoism) lost his power completely. On the contrary, %0a%3c he became very good, for upon being corrected, egoism becomes a great and %0a%3c holy Kli, the one Kli that can receive the greatest Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a state will come at the end of the general correction, when, due to the %0a%3c revelation of this great Light, death (egoism) will disappear forever. This is the %0a%3c meaning of the verse: "when the Creator saw EVERYTHING that He had made %0a%3c (i.e., at the end of all creation), He saw that it was very good." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since Adam's sin, the worlds can no longer ascend as high. This %0a%3c is why we need special Mitzvot in order to perform special preparations and %0a%3c actions for the reception of Ohr Haya, at least in a state called Shabbat. This %0a%3c is precisely the Mitzva to redeem one's first-born son, when we weaken the %0a%3c powers of the angel of death and strengthen the angel of life, much like what %0a%3c the Creator did to Adam by the preliminary ascents of all the worlds, for %0a%3c %0a%3c 451 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 452 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c during such an ascent, called Shabbat, the angel of death becomes very good. %0a%3c Such is the power of that Mitzva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, it is not observed as fully as previously, when the angel of death lost %0a%3c all of his power. Now, by observing the Mitzva of redemption of the first-born %0a%3c son, we merely distance from the angel of death without actually destroying the %0a%3c impure forces, and they no longer cling to him. And after preventing the impure %0a%3c forces from clinging, accomplished with the help of this Mitzva, he can receive %0a%3c life, i.e., Ohr Haya of the state of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 247. The fourteenth Mitzva is to observe Shabbat, which is a day of rest from %0a%3c all the actions of creation. There are two Mitzvot here: to observe the day of %0a%3c Shabbat and to adorn its holiness, namely to receive Ohr Hochma, called %0a%3c "holiness;" and to observe Shabbat as a day of rest for all the worlds, in which %0a%3c all actions are multiplied and realized even before this day is sanctified. %0a%3c %0a%3c Shabbat is a state of the spiritual worlds where the Light descending from %0a%3c Above elevates ZA to AA, Nukva to AVI, the worlds of BYA to YESHSUT, and %0a%3c ZON of the world of Atzilut. As a result, man's NRN (whoever has it, whoever is %0a%3c spiritually present in the worlds of BYA) also ascends to Atzilut with the worlds %0a%3c of BYA, and there receives Ohr Haya. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA- %0a%3c %0a%3c M- %0a%3c %0a%3c BYA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that there are two Mitzvot: to refrain from working and carrying %0a%3c things from one household to another. This is so because when all the worlds %0a%3c are completely freed from the impure forces, we must guard against the impure %0a%3c forces, so they do not return and mingle with the holiness of Shabbat. And he %0a%3c who works causes the impure forces to mingle with the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second Mitzva is to adorn the day of Shabbat: through the pleasures of %0a%3c Shabbat (the ascent of the worlds of ABYA), man receives (in his spiritual desires %0a%3c existing in the world of BYA) the Light of the world of Atzilut from Above. This %0a%3c Light of Atzilut is called "holiness" (Hochma); hence, man becomes sanctified by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c 453 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c AA %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI %0a%3c %0a%3c YESHSUT + ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsaofthe World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 454 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All purifications and corrections take place only in our work and struggle %0a%3c with the impure forces, preventing us from drawing nearer and merging with the %0a%3c Creator in our properties. It is precisely in the wars with the impure forces that %0a%3c we extract the sparks of the Light that they swallowed up, and each extraction of %0a%3c a spark of the Light from the impure forces and its ascent to the world of Atzilut %0a%3c is defined as independent, individual work. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the beginning, these sparks were sorted and extracted from the impure %0a%3c forces by the Creator Himself. This is described in His actions in the six days of %0a%3c creation. And when all the extractions of the Light sparks ended, the work was %0a%3c considered finished, and the corrected state, called Shabbat, arrives; and it is the %0a%3c day of rest, for there is nothing else to correct. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Shabbat is the day (the state when the Light shines in the worlds) %0a%3c when all the correction work in all the worlds ceases. For every Sbabbat (the %0a%3c state of ascent in the spiritual worlds to the level of correction of all the impure %0a%3c forces), the same state of the perfection of creation's first Sbabbat returns and %0a%3c brings rest to all the worlds of ABYA. All the impure forces become detached, %0a%3c remote, and return to their place (Tebom Raba— great abyss), and all the worlds %0a%3c ascend to the world of Atzilut, defined as perfect unity. And we are destined %0a%3c to receive this holiness, the Light of the world of Atzilut; it descends upon us %0a%3c through our observance of the two Mitzvot: REMEMBER AND GUARD THE %0a%3c DAY OF SHABBAT. %0a%3c %0a%3c 248. Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodiless spirits was to be %0a%3c completed. Asks: "Was the Creator unable to delay the sanctification of that %0a%3c day until the bodies for those spirits were created?" And answers: "The Tree %0a%3c of Knowledge of Good and Evil contained an evil side that wanted to govern %0a%3c the world. And many spirits separated and went forth, armed, to clothe in the %0a%3c bodies of this world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Because that day was sanctified, the creation of bodies for the spirits was to %0a%3c be completed. This means that the day had been sanctified before the Creator %0a%3c had time to create bodies for those spirits. It is written about this on the first %0a%3c Sbabbat of creation: "And on the seventh day the Creator finished His work, %0a%3c which He has made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work, which %0a%3c He has made." %0a%3c %0a%3c This passage from the Torah is unclear. For if the Creator completely %0a%3c finished all His work by Himself, then He left nothing for us to do. After all, %0a%3c He finished everything Himself. However, the Creator sorted the Light sparks %0a%3c and separated the pure forces from the impure ones precisely to enable us to do, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 455 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i.e., to complete this work by making our own efforts in the observance of the %0a%3c To rah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the rest that is mentioned here refers only to what the Creator Himself %0a%3c had to do. Therefore, the Torah says that the Creator finished His work, for %0a%3c He has completed all the preparations for us, and nothing else is required of %0a%3c Him, for the rest HE HAS MADE for us to do. This enables us to do and to %0a%3c complete creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it is written that the Creator did not have time to create bodies for %0a%3c the spirits before the arrival of Shabbat. These bodiless spirits constitute all of %0a%3c our impure and evil forces that drive man to transgressions. And the Creator %0a%3c intentionally left them this way, for it is precisely because they are present within %0a%3c us that we have freedom of will in our work with the Torah and Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Adam's sin in Malchut, called "The Tree of Knowledge of %0a%3c Good and Evil," pure and impure forces were mixed. At that, the impure forces %0a%3c wished to rule over the forces of good in the world, so the forces of good would %0a%3c never prevail over them. Thus, a number of armed spirits went forth, intending %0a%3c to attack the bodies, capture them, and clothe in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two points merged in Malchut: one was corrected by receiving the properties %0a%3c of Bina, mercy, and the other is the strictness of judgment, the result of %0a%3c restrictions within Malchut herself. When Malchut is united with the pure forces, %0a%3c her property of restriction is concealed, and the point of mercy is revealed (item %0a%3c 123). Then man is said to merit only goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if man transgresses, he attacks the good point and thereby reveals %0a%3c the point of restriction in Malchut. Thus, the forces that wish to harm and destroy %0a%3c the corrected part and to rule over man become revealed, and this is evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if he merits for the point of mercy to reveal itself and dominate, %0a%3c he can elevate Malchut to Bina, thereby causing Supernal mercy and Light to %0a%3c descend. However, if he does not merit, and the point of restriction is revealed %0a%3c in Malchut, not only does he thereby harm Malchut, but he also harms the point %0a%3c of Bina that unites with Malchut. Thus, this point turns from good to evil, %0a%3c from mercy to judgment, as restriction is revealed in Malchut herself, and every %0a%3c revealed property dominates. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the point of judgment was revealed in Malchut after Adam's sin. %0a%3c By this, Adam damaged the point (property) of Bina that united with Malchut, %0a%3c too, turning it from mercy to strictness, judgment. Yet, the correction of Malchut %0a%3c is possible only with the help of this point, for it is called "goodness." And when %0a%3c this point of Bina is revealed within her, Malchut is called "goodness," too. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 456 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But now that the very point of Bina in Malchut was damaged and turned %0a%3c from good to evil, the impure force thought that the time has come for it to %0a%3c dominate the world and clothe human bodies, meaning Adam and his sons %0a%3c (spiritual Partzufim). In other words, the body (desires) of the impure force %0a%3c inherits the place of Adam's body. Thus, the correction of Malchut from the %0a%3c good point becomes impossible, for no more goodness comes to Malchut from %0a%3c Bina, and this property has become evil, strictness, and judgment, due to the %0a%3c restricted reception in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c And many armed and destructive impure forces went forth to attack so %0a%3c as to clothe human bodies (desires) in this world, and rule over them. For the %0a%3c impure force thought that nothing could protect and save the pure forces from %0a%3c it because of the harm that Adam's sin brought to the system of governance and %0a%3c the point of mercy in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c 249. However, as the Creator saw this, He roused the wind from within the %0a%3c Tree of Life, ZA, and struck the other Tree, Malchut. And the other, good %0a%3c side was awakened, and the day was sanctified. For the creation of bodies and %0a%3c the awakening of spirits on that night of Shabbat stem from the good side, %0a%3c and not from the evil one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Creator saw the strengthening of the power of judgment and %0a%3c the impure forces, their ability to clothe the bodies in this world (completely %0a%3c excluding the possibility of correcting the world in the future), He roused the %0a%3c wind within the Tree of Life and struck the other Tree (made a Zivug with it), %0a%3c Malchut. Due to this Zivug, the Tree of Life passed the spirit of life to the other %0a%3c Tree, Malchut, thus enabling Malchut to tear away from the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, the good side reappeared in Malchut, as it was prior to Adam's %0a%3c sin, and the sanctity of Shabbat descended to the world. That is, although the %0a%3c impure forces had the strength to clothe in bodies, and were more powerful %0a%3c than the pure forces, and, according to the law, they were supposed to prevail, %0a%3c at that moment the Creator intervened, disregarding the destruction caused %0a%3c by Adam's sin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consequently, ZON (the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good) %0a%3c united in a Zivug, as before Adam's sin, and the Light of sanctity of Shabbat %0a%3c descended into the world. This action of the Creator caused Shabbat (the Light %0a%3c of Shabbat) to descend into the world, and the impure forces lost the opportunity %0a%3c to clothe in human bodies in this world. The impure force remained as a bodiless %0a%3c spirit, which enables man to draw closer to the Creator (with his properties). %0a%3c This is referred to as his return (Teshuva). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 457 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The creation of bodies and the arousal of spirits on that night of Shabbat %0a%3c stems from the good side, and not from the side of the impure forces, for the %0a%3c Creator's action remains in creation forever. Just as on the first Shabbat of %0a%3c creation, the Creator completely disregarded the damage of Adam's sin, instead %0a%3c compelling ZON to make a Zivug, and the day was sanctified as before the sin, %0a%3c for He destroyed all the power of the impure forces, despite the fact that they %0a%3c had the strength to rule. %0a%3c %0a%3c The same applies to all Sbabbatot (plural for Sbabbat)— the spiritual ascents %0a%3c for those who exist in the worlds of BYA— during the 6,000 years. Although %0a%3c man is still full of impurity, for he has yet to correct the sins of the Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge, when he makes a Zivug (of the Light with a screen) on the night of %0a%3c Sbabbat (in a spiritual state of that name), the impure forces (of man) have no %0a%3c power over him (his altruistic desires). In this Zivug, man assumes the body and %0a%3c spirit of a newborn, as though he was unharmed by Adam's sin, as though he %0a%3c himself corrected the Tree of Knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c And despite the fact that man has yet to merit liberation from his egoism, %0a%3c the impure forces have no power over him on that night. Thus, he can receive %0a%3c the bodies and spirits in his Zivug on the side of the Tree of Good, but not from %0a%3c the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c 250. And had he hastened on that night to put forward the other side, before %0a%3c the good side came forward, he would not have been able to withstand it for %0a%3c even an instant. But the Creator provided the remedy in advance. And He %0a%3c sanctified the day beforehand. And He warned to appear before the other %0a%3c side. And the world exists. And that the opposite side thought to rule in the %0a%3c world, i.e., in defiance of it, the good side was created and strengthened on %0a%3c that night. And the good, holy bodies and spirits were created on that night %0a%3c from the good side. Therefore, the delight of sages who know this spans from %0a%3c Shabbat to Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 251. However, when the other (impure) side saw that what it had planned %0a%3c to do was already done by the holy side, it started to check its own forces %0a%3c and properties, and saw all those who perform a Zivug naked and in the %0a%3c candlelight. Therefore, all of the sons born from that Zivug are enslaved by %0a%3c the spirit of the other side. And these naked spirits of the wicked are called %0a%3c "harming," and they are ruled and killed by Lilit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 252. And since the day was sanctified, and holiness rules in the world, the other %0a%3c side diminishes itself and hides on each Shabbat day and on each Shabbat %0a%3c night. With the exception of Asimon and his group, who walk secretly in the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 458 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Candlelight, to observe the naked Zivug. And then they hide inside the cave, %0a%3c called Tehom Raba (the great abyss). And as soon as Shabbat ends, many %0a%3c hosts fly and prowl in the world. As a result, everything is corrected by the %0a%3c song of the sufferers, "He who dwells in concealment," to prevent impurity %0a%3c from governing holiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the law, the impure force was supposed to rule in the world, for %0a%3c it was stronger than the pure one, and it was to clothe in human bodies. But then, %0a%3c the earth would have been given over to the wicked, and all the generations in the %0a%3c world originating from man would have stemmed from the side of the impure %0a%3c forces. And there would have been no chance of correction, for impurity would %0a%3c have dominated over all the generations to such an extent that there would have %0a%3c been no opportunity to get hold of the good side even for a moment. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator provided a remedy, thereby forestalling the defect, for %0a%3c He elevated Shabbat and removed the impure forces, which caused the Light of %0a%3c peace and rest to be revealed in all the worlds. And all the impure forces were %0a%3c thrown into Tehom Raba (the great abyss). Thus, the world was revived, as this %0a%3c enabled the creation of bodies and spirits from the pure side in a Zivug of the %0a%3c Shabbat night, and the world advances toward the desired goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c So what does it mean to forestall the defect via a remedy? The whole of %0a%3c creation is based on a cause and effect sequence, and all that transpires not %0a%3c according to the worlds' development is called "forestalling" (skipping several %0a%3c degrees, bypassing some of the causes and effects in this chain). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the sanctity of Shabbat came as an awakening from Above, from the %0a%3c Creator's desire, without any desire or request from below, for Adam had yet to %0a%3c make any corrections and draw closer to the Creator in order to merit Shabbat (when %0a%3c the Creator Himself prevented the defect by providing a remedy for the correction %0a%3c of the world), this action on the Creator's behalf is called "forestalling." %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as the impure force planned to assume power over the world, the good %0a%3c side forestalled its actions on that night. For this night that followed the sin %0a%3c in the Tree of Knowledge was given entirely to the impure forces. Hence, they %0a%3c thought that they would obviously rule over the world. However, the opposite %0a%3c had happened— sanctity took their place: pure bodies and spirits were created %0a%3c on that night by the good side. This is because such a preparation took place %0a%3c that all the Zivugim on that night created bodies and spirits from the good side, %0a%3c without any participation of the impure force. In other words, what transpired %0a%3c was exactly the opposite of the impure force's expectations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the time of sages who know this spans from Shabbat to Shabbat— %0a%3c for at this time, bodies and spirits are created from the pure, good side. And %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 459 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when the impure force sees that what it wanted to create was created by the %0a%3c opposite side, it collects its evil powers and searches through the whole world, %0a%3c and sees all those who make a Zivug in the candlelight, exposing their naked %0a%3c bodies. And ill sons are made from this Zivug. The impure side sends these %0a%3c sons its evil spirits of the wicked, called "wreckers." As a result, they are ruled %0a%3c and killed by Lilit. Garments refer to Ohr Hassadim, the garments of Ima, the %0a%3c intention "for the sake of the Creator." %0a%3c %0a%3c When the sanctity of Shabbat comes into the world, and Shabbat rules in the %0a%3c world, the power of the impure force dwindles and hides on the night and on %0a%3c the day of Shabbat. Hence, this is the time of sages. %0a%3c %0a%3c And only the wreckers, called "Asimon and his group," walk secretly in the %0a%3c candlelight, to observe those who expose their Zivug. Afterward, they hide in %0a%3c the ~Nukva of Tehom Raba. Thus, although Asimon has the power to see the Zivug %0a%3c in the candlelight and on Shabbat, he cannot do harm on Shabbat, but must %0a%3c immediately return to the Nukva of Tehom Raba. Only after Shabbat is over can %0a%3c he resume causing harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Shimon felt the difficulty of explaining the words regarding Shabbat %0a%3c being the time of sages. For each day (not only on Shabbat night), starting at %0a%3c midnight, the Creator walks around the Garden of Eden and makes Zivugim with %0a%3c the sages. The Zohar asks the same question (Veyikahel, item 194), and answers %0a%3c that there is a difference between a Zivug on a week night and one that is made %0a%3c in the candlelight on Shabbat. On weekdays, the impure force has the power to %0a%3c inflict maladies on the newborns, and Lilit has the power to kill them. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, on Shabbat nights, although the wrecker Asimon and his group are %0a%3c present, he has not the power to harm, but only after Shabbat is over. However, %0a%3c opposite his opportunity to cause harm after Shabbat there exists a correction, %0a%3c called Havdalah, the separation of Shabbat from the weekdays through a blessing, %0a%3c a prayer, and a cup of wine, which completely annul the power of this wrecker. %0a%3c Hence, there is a significant difference between a Zivug on a week night and a %0a%3c Zivug on the night of Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that there is a source of Light, ZA, Supernal unity, and a source %0a%3c of fire, Malchut, lower unity (item 209). Also, there are three details in the %0a%3c candle flame (this refers to a spiritual candle, designated in corporeality by a %0a%3c wick floating in olive oil): %0a%3c %0a%3c - White Upper flame; %0a%3c %0a%3c - Lower flame; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The coarse part— wick and oil, supporting the lower flame. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 460 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This lower flame is called "devouring flame." It designates judgment, the %0a%3c power of restriction in the candle. Thus, it devours everything below it, the wick %0a%3c and the oil. And the Upper white flame signifies mercy contained in the candle, %0a%3c for white means mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c And he who makes a Zivug in the candlelight will see his children damaged, %0a%3c and Lilit will be able to kill them, for the candle contains the strictness of %0a%3c judgment, and the impure forces can therefore cling to such a Zivug. Due to the %0a%3c strictness of judgment, their bodies (the impurities contained in the bodies that %0a%3c participate in a Zivug, each of which finds what suits them) become revealed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, a Zivug is permitted only at midnight, i.e., only in the darkness, %0a%3c when there is absolutely no Light, when Malchut is said to "awaken at night," and %0a%3c mercy is revealed. However, if there is some candlelight, it reveals the impurity %0a%3c in the bodies, and the impure forces cling to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the candlelight, the impure force sees impurity in the bodies of those %0a%3c making a Zivug, and it informs on them and clings to their bodies. However, all %0a%3c the restrictions of strictness and judgment disappear on the night of Shabbat, %0a%3c and the coarse lower flame becomes like the white Upper flame. This means %0a%3c that even candlelight is permitted. Moreover, under the influence of the sanctity %0a%3c of Shabbat, all the impurity disappears from man's body, hence there is no fear %0a%3c to reveal the body in the candlelight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, even on Shabbat, when the coarse flame turns white and the judgment %0a%3c of restrictions disappears, the white flame of the candle nonetheless requires %0a%3c the light's coarse part, so it would act as foundation. And the coarse foundation %0a%3c designates an indispensable presence of judgment and restrictions, for coarseness %0a%3c constitutes restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, these restrictions do not appear on Shabbat. This resembles %0a%3c a coin without any image, so its denomination is unknown. Therefore, the %0a%3c wrecker, this coarse, detrimental part of the candle that supports the white %0a%3c flame, is called Asimon (Hebrew, Token), signifying a coin without image. %0a%3c %0a%3c The coarse part of the candle secretly ascends along with the white %0a%3c candlelight, as the candle cannot burn without it. Hence, this coarse part sees %0a%3c the exposed Zivug and can therefore do harm after the end of Shabbat. Although %0a%3c the revelation (exposure) of bodies does no harm on the night of Shabbat (the %0a%3c impurity of the body remains concealed during Shabbat), as soon as Shabbat is %0a%3c over, the impure force can reveal itself and harm. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since, after Shabbat, Asimon and his group return to their forms %0a%3c (properties) and rise up from the Great Abyss (Tehom Raba) to the place of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 461 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c settlement, they soar above the world and can cause harm. There is a song: %0a%3c "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One," for man saves himself from %0a%3c harmful forces by praying and returning to the Creator: %0a%3c %0a%3c "He who sits in the shadow of the Supernal One (dwells under the shelter of %0a%3c the Supernal One) dwells in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord: %0a%3c 'my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you %0a%3c from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with %0a%3c his feathers, and under his wings will you find refuge; his faithfulness will be %0a%3c your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that %0a%3c flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that %0a%3c destroys at midday. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right %0a%3c hand, but it will not come near you. You will only observe with your eyes and %0a%3c see the punishment of the wicked..." (Tehilim, 91:1-8). %0a%3c %0a%3c 253. What places do they visit on the night of the end of Shabbat 7 . When they %0a%3c come out in haste and wish to govern the holy nation, they see it standing in %0a%3c prayer and singing this song: "He who sits in the shadow (concealment) of the %0a%3c Supernal One," first separating Shabbat from the weekdays in his prayer, and %0a%3c then over a cup of wine, these forces flee thence and fly away to the desert. %0a%3c May the Merciful One save us from them and from the evil side. %0a%3c %0a%3c Here the question concerns only the night of the end of Shabbat, but not %0a%3c the night of weekdays, as the night of the end of Shabbat still contains some %0a%3c force of the sanctity of Shabbat. Hence, although the impure forces rise from %0a%3c Tebom Raba and fly to conquer Israel, when they see Israel's actions in song of %0a%3c prayer and in the blessing over a cup of wine, they fly away to the wasteland, an %0a%3c unpopulated place. Thus, people escape their reach. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that impure forces dwell in three places: %0a%3c %0a%3c - On Sbabbat, they dwell in Nukva of Tebom Raba and have no power to %0a%3c cause harm; %0a%3c %0a%3c - When Sbabbat is over, they are kept in the wasteland with the help %0a%3c of prayer, Havdalah, separation of Sbabbat from weekdays, and the %0a%3c blessing over a cup of wine. They have the power to cause harm, but %0a%3c can't, as they are in an unpopulated place; %0a%3c %0a%3c - On other nights they are also present in populated places. %0a%3c %0a%3c 254. The three that cause evil to themselves: a) he who curses himself; b) he %0a%3c who throws away bread or bread crumbs bigger than an olive; c) he who lights %0a%3c the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel attains sanctity in the prayer, %0a%3c "And You are holy." And the light from that candle ignites hellfire. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 462 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 255. There is a place in hell for those who transgress Shabbat. And as they are %0a%3c punished in hell, they curse him who lit the candle before its time, and they %0a%3c say to him, "Behold: the Creator will thrust you about with a mighty throw, %0a%3c and He will seize you firmly. He will violently roll and toss you like a ball into %0a%3c a large land; there shall you die" (Yeshayahu, 22:17-18). %0a%3c %0a%3c One wrecker is called the "evil eye." And he loves cursing, as it is said; %0a%3c "Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, %0a%3c and it is far from him" (Tehilim, 109:17). When man curses himself, he thereby %0a%3c empowers the evil eye to love cursing, and it rules over him— thus, man brings %0a%3c harm to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is nothing in this world that does not have an Upper Root Above. %0a%3c Especially bread, on which man's life depends, has its own special root Above. %0a%3c Therefore, he who neglects his bread brings harm to the root of his life Above. %0a%3c Everyone understands this, but only to the extent of the portion that satiates %0a%3c him, giving him life. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if a piece of bread and crumbs are smaller than an olive, there %0a%3c are those who neglect and throw them away, as such amount cannot satiate %0a%3c man. Yet, the sages instructed us to bless as a meal even an olive-sized amount %0a%3c of bread, obliging us to treat such portion as satiating, so we have no right to %0a%3c neglect such an amount. And he who neglects it brings harms to himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is explained in the Talmud: "They asked the Creator: %0a%3c Master of the world, it is said in your Torah that one should not turn his face %0a%3c and accept bribes. Yet, You turn Your face to Israel..." The Creator replied: %0a%3c "How can I help turning my face to Israel if they observe the law 'down to the %0a%3c size of an olive...'" (Berachot, 20:2). In other words, by accepting an olive-sized %0a%3c bread crumb as a satiating meal, we merit revealing the Creator's face, even %0a%3c though we are unworthy of it. Therefore, those who neglect the amount of bread %0a%3c the size of an olive and do not consider it a satiating meal do not merit revealing %0a%3c the Creator's face; hence, they bring harm to themselves. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who lights the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel has reached %0a%3c sanctity in the blessing, thereby ignites hellfire. This is because prior to that %0a%3c moment, it was Shabbat; its sanctity prevailed, and hellfire has no power on %0a%3c Shabbat. Hence, he who transgresses Shabbat and lights the candle prematurely, %0a%3c Ignites hellfire and brings harm to himself, for the transgression of Sbabbat is %0a%3c regarded as the gravest transgression. Hence, there is a special place in hell for %0a%3c those who transgress Sbabbat. And they who are punished in hell curse the %0a%3c sinner for igniting hellfire prematurely. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Fourteenth Commandment %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 463 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 256. For he should not light the candle at the end of Shabbat before Israel %0a%3c separates Shabbat from the weekdays in their prayer and over a cup of wine, %0a%3c as until that time, it is still Shabbat, and the sanctity of Shabbat still rules %0a%3c over us. And during the separation by means of blessing over a cup, all those %0a%3c hosts and legions that the rulers appointed to govern the weekdays return %0a%3c each to their place to resume the work for which they are responsible. %0a%3c %0a%3c The main prohibition remains in effect only until the blessing in the prayer. %0a%3c Nevertheless, one should beware of lighting a candle before the actual separation %0a%3c of Shabbat from the weekdays in the blessings over a cup, as it is still Shabbat. %0a%3c Of course, one can light a candle for the actual separation of Shabbat from the %0a%3c weekdays, i.e., for the blessing over a lit candle. %0a%3c %0a%3c 257. As soon as Shabbat starts and the day is sanctified, holiness awakens %0a%3c and rules over the world; the power of weekdays disappears and returns only %0a%3c when Shabbat ends. However, although Shabbat is over, other forces do not %0a%3c regain their power until Israel says the prayer, "He who separates holiness %0a%3c from the weekdays." Only then does holiness disappear, and the legions that %0a%3c govern the weekdays awaken and return to their places, each to its above- %0a%3c appointed post. %0a%3c %0a%3c 258. Nevertheless, the impure forces do not assume control until the flame %0a%3c of the candle is lit, for they all come from the root (element) of fire, from %0a%3c which everything originates, and they descend to rule over the lower world. %0a%3c All this happens if one lights the candle before Israel has finished the blessing %0a%3c in the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called the "pillar of fire" (item 209), and the forces that exist in %0a%3c the candlelight are the restrictions in Malchut. It is impossible to use these forces %0a%3c before the candle is lit. %0a%3c %0a%3c 259. Yet, if he waits until they complete the blessing, the wicked in hell justify the %0a%3c Creator's justice over them, and they bring upon him all the blessings, recited %0a%3c by the congregation: "Therefore, the Creator gives you of the dew of Heaven," %0a%3c "Blessed shall you be in your town," and "Blessed shall you be in the field." %0a%3c %0a%3c By reciting the blessings, we evoke the descent of the great Light, and its %0a%3c power saves us from hell. And since the wicked in hell see this, they regret %0a%3c committing their sins and justify the Creator's judgment brought upon them %0a%3c by seeing their punishment. And since man evoked such justification of the %0a%3c Creator's judgment, all the blessings, recited at the end of Shabbat by the %0a%3c congregation become fulfilled in him. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 464 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 260. "Blessed is he who considers the poor; the Creator will deliver him in the %0a%3c day of disaster" (Tehilim, 41:2). What do the words "in the day of disaster" %0a%3c mean? This refers to the day when evil gains power and wants to take his soul %0a%3c away from him. The word "poor" alludes to someone very sick. "He who %0a%3c considers" refers to one who realizes the need to be cured from transgressions %0a%3c before the Creator. Another explanation is that this is the Day of Judgment in %0a%3c the world. "He who considers" signifies one who knows how to save himself %0a%3c from it, as it is written: "The Creator will deliver him in the day of disaster," %0a%3c meaning that on the day when the judgment against man dominates the %0a%3c world, the Creator will deliver him. %0a%3c %0a%3c "The day of disaster" is a state when the impure forces, called "evil," govern %0a%3c man and take his soul away. "He who considers the poor" is one who tells %0a%3c the sick to return to the Creator to correct himself. It is him who the Creator %0a%3c delivers from the rule of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar continues by saying that there are three sources of evil for the soul %0a%3c of a man that attracts it onto himself. Hence, it advises one who considers and %0a%3c is compassionate to the poor, to appeal to the sick man's heart (he who feels %0a%3c sick in his own evil, egoism) to return to the Creator. Then the Creator will cure %0a%3c him. And on this day of disaster, which man caused to his soul, the Creator will %0a%3c deliver him through this reward. %0a%3c %0a%3c Even if judgment dominates the world, the Creator will deliver him, for %0a%3c he taught the sick to return to the Creator and explained to them the need for %0a%3c correction. And the difference in the explanations is that the first refers to an %0a%3c individual who discovers evil within himself, and the second refers to the evil %0a%3c of the entire world. And here, the Creator, too, will deliver man as a reward for %0a%3c fulfilling this Mitzva. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written in The Zohar (Veyikahel, pp. 32-52): "Each day a voice calls upon %0a%3c all people in the world, 'This depends on you. Separate a part of yourself and %0a%3c devote it to the Creator.'" At some point in life, thoughts and desires to draw %0a%3c closer to the spiritual come to every person, and it depends on us whether or %0a%3c not we heed that inner call. The voice reassures man that by casting aside his %0a%3c needless, transient, and earthly desires, by ceasing his endless chase for their %0a%3c appeasement, he will attain true and eternal happiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we can understand the secret meaning of prayer: he who fears %0a%3c the Creator and directs his heart and desires in his prayer, carries out great %0a%3c and exalted corrections. If one wishes to enter the spiritual realm and feel the %0a%3c eator, the only thing he must do is pray, i.e., ask the Creator to correct %0a%3c , to transform it from the nature of our world (egoistic) into the n %0a%3c iritual realm (altruistic). He will then enter eternity and trans %0a%3c e boundaries of our world. Being completely enslaved by his egoism, man %0a%3c nable to change himself on his own. %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct himself, man needs to receive the strength that exists outside of %0a%3c him, beyond the bounds of his egoism. He must ask to receive this strength %0a%3c hence, the only thing man must do is pray. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, prayer is not uttered by one's mouth. Rather, it is the desire in our %0a%3c heart, for the Creator reads the desires in our hearts. Therefore, man's only task %0a%3c to transform his heart's desires— for his heart to wish to change its own desires %0a%3c %0a%3c it by himself; he must ask the Creator for it. %0a%3c %0a%3c to exalting the Creator's rule, faith in Hi %0a%3c gularity, His power, His ability and desire to help. All of man's effor %0a%3c create the only true desire within him— to feel the Creator! Here, The Zohar. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 465 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 466 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ready attained the spiritual worlds with their desires and properties, and, %0a%3c ;ing in our world, perceive and exist in the two worlds simultaneously. %0a%3c The prayer the book refers to here constitutes the spiritual actions of one who %0a%3c has already acquired spiritual instruments, and can utilize them in exactly the %0a%3c same way we use our hands and auxiliary means in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c First, in the songs and hymns of the Supernal angels, and according to the %0a%3c order of chants sung by the sons of Israel below, Malchut adorns and corrects %0a%3c herself as a wife who adorns herself for her husband. The sons of Israel are those %0a%3c who wish to become Yashar (straight) and El (Creator), i.e., to draw closer to, %0a%3c or go straight to the Creator. Such people, who exist in the Upper Worlds with %0a%3c their spiritual (altruistic) instruments (desires), can change the states of Higher %0a%3c Sefirot and worlds by their spiritual actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our prayer-book was compiled by the sages of the Great Assembly twenty %0a%3c centuries ago. Before that, everyone addressed the Creator in accordance with %0a%3c what he or she felt. About twenty centuries ago, coarser souls began descendin %0a%3c )ur world, which needed orderly prayers. Hence, the members of the ( %0a%3c )ly (great Kabbalists) created the prayer book that we still use today. %0a%3c %0a%3c rderly fashion, the prayer book expounds all the consecutive %0a%3c lan's correction. Behind the words of the prayer book, one who understands %0a%3c sees the spiritual actions that he needs to perform. This information is conveyed %0a%3c in letters, in their forms and combinations, as well as in the sequence of senteno %0a%3c and parts of the whole prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the order of the prayer, correction of the worlds comes first %0a%3c by the morning blessings (See Tefilat Kol Peh) up to the prayer of Shmone Esreh, %0a%3c correction in a sitting position. Then, when they reach the words Emet ve Yatziv %0a%3c that conclude Kriyat Shema, all the worlds achieve correction. And as they reach %0a%3c the words Gaal Israel, all the corrections are to take their places; hence, they %0a%3c continue reciting the Shmone Esreh prayer while standing. %0a%3c %0a%3c In spirituality (and, consequently, in corporeality) a person can be in one %0a%3c of three states: lying, sitting, or standing. A newborn infant in our world and %0a%3c a spiritually newborn person develop in the same order. Lying means that the %0a%3c position of the head, the legs, and the body are at the same level. In the spiritual, %0a%3c this corresponds to the embryonic state, when all that exists in the ten Sefirot is %0a%3c the same. This is the lowest spiritual state. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sitting means that the head is above the body, and the body is above the %0a%3c legs, but one cannot use his legs. Such a state is called Katnut (smallness) or VAK. %0a%3c Standing implies absolute distinction between the levels of the head, body, and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 467 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c legs. It is called Gadlut (big state) or GAR. Thus, according to one's ability to ask %0a%3c for correction, he gradually receives strength from the Creator and grows. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when he reaches the words Emet ve Yatziv, everything has already %0a%3c been corrected: all of the worlds bear Malchut in them, while Malchut herself %0a%3c bears the Supernal King. When man reaches the words, Gaal Israel, the Supernal %0a%3c King advances along the degrees, along the three lines, and comes forward to %0a%3c receive Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Supernal King (the Creator), with regard to all created beings, constitutes %0a%3c ZA of the world of Atzilut, for Malchut de Atzilut is the sum of all creations. %0a%3c Everything that was ever created, including us and all the worlds with all that %0a%3c inhabit them, is a part of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c In our initial state, we are the parts of Malchut that receive the smallest %0a%3c portion of the Creator's Light, Ner Dalcilc (tiny candle). As we draw closer to the %0a%3c Creator in our properties (making them similar to His), we receive increasingly %0a%3c greater Light, in proportion to our advancement, which we feel as infinite bliss, %0a%3c peace, delight, eternity, and as a life-force. %0a%3c %0a%3c The degrees of our closeness to the Creator (our "I" and Him, Malchut %0a%3c and ZA) are described in Kabbalah using a special language: the nearing of %0a%3c properties is considered a transition from the state of "back to back" between ZA %0a%3c and Malchut to the state of "face to face." The souls' union with the Creator is %0a%3c described as a Zivug— sexual act between ZA and Malchut, whereupon ZA passes %0a%3c the Light to Malchut, and each soul, in proportion to its correction, can thereby %0a%3c receive this Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c Naturally, the Creator remains in a state of absolute rest, and all His alleged %0a%3c movements are felt with regard to Malchut, depending on the changes in her %0a%3c properties. At times she feels Him more and at times less, and she perceives this %0a%3c as His movement toward her. %0a%3c %0a%3c We must stand in humility and awe before the Supernal King, each in his %0a%3c place, for He extends His right hand to Malchut in Magen Abraham, the first %0a%3c blessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the right line. Then He puts His %0a%3c left hand under the head of Malchut, as it is written: "Let his left hand be under %0a%3c my head, and his right hand embrace me" (Shir HaShirim, 2:6) in the blessing Ata %0a%3c Gibor, the second blessing in the Shmone Esreh prayer, designating the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire magnificent Shir HaShirim (Song of Songs) speaks of the Supernal %0a%3c merging of all the creatures with the Creator. Since our world is created as a %0a%3c reflection of the spiritual world, spiritual merging can only be described with the %0a%3c corresponding words of our world. Because our world is egoistic, the spiritual, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 468 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c altruistic actions, directed toward the merging of properties and desires, are %0a%3c described in the words of our world as Malchut (man's soul) drawing closer to the %0a%3c Creator in her properties, followed by their gradual unification. First, it manifests %0a%3c in the form of an embrace, followed by a kiss, then a coition, when the soul is %0a%3c sufficiently corrected to receive the Light (Ohr Hochma) from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, ZA and Malchut embrace and unite in a kiss of the blessing %0a%3c HaEl HaKadosh, designating the middle line. From this state and higher on, %0a%3c everything transpires in the state of a kiss, up to the last three blessings in the %0a%3c Shmone Esreh prayer. This is the spiritual, true meaning of the first three blessings %0a%3c of the Shmone Esreh prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, if one is able to make a spiritual action that corresponds to %0a%3c the conditions described in these blessings, he attains unity with the Creator %0a%3c that it is called "embrace" and "kiss." The detailed explanation of the spiritual %0a%3c actions is given in The Study of the Ten Sefirot by Rabbi Ashlag. The language of %0a%3c The Zohar and the Torah describes these actions with words of our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language of Kabbalah describes them by using the names of Sefirot, %0a%3c Partzufim, and Lights. The most complete and precise language for the description %0a%3c of spiritual actions is the language of Sefirot. Therefore, this was the language %0a%3c chosen by Kabbalists for their inner work and for explaining to us the practice %0a%3c and method of spiritual ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man must aspire to the Creator in his heart and desires in order to acquire %0a%3c the intentions that bring him to correction in all the spiritual states described in %0a%3c this prayer— for his mouth and his heart (desires) to become a single whole, so his %0a%3c lips will not speak against the wishes of his heart. The Creator awaits only the %0a%3c sincerity of our desires so as to fulfill them at once and bring us closer to Him: %0a%3c %0a%3c Beloved of the soul, Compassionate Father! %0a%3c Draw Your servant to Your will. %0a%3c %0a%3c Your servant will hurry like a hart, will how before Your majesty. %0a%3c %0a%3c To him Your friendship will he sweeter %0a%3c %0a%3c Than the dripping of the honeycomb and any taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c Majestic, Beautiful Radiance of the universe! %0a%3c My soul pines for Your love. %0a%3c %0a%3c Please O God, heal her now showing her the pleasantness of Your radiance. %0a%3c Then she will be strengthened and healed %0a%3c And eternal gladness will be hers. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 469 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c All-worthy One, may Your mercy be aroused %0a%3c And please take pity on the son of Your beloved. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because it is so very long that I have yearned intensely to see the splendor of strength. %0a%3c These my heart desires, and please take pity and do not conceal Yourself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Please be revealed and spread upon me, my Beloved, the shelter of Your peace. %0a%3c Illuminate the land with Your glory, we shall rejoice and be glad in You. %0a%3c Make haste, do love, for the time has come, and pardon us as in days of old. %0a%3c %0a%3c (Song Yedid Nefesh) %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Creator and Malchut merge in a kiss, he who needs advice and %0a%3c assistance can ask for it, for this state is called the "time of desire." And since %0a%3c man appealed before the King and Queen in the twelve intermediate blessings %0a%3c of the Shmone Esreh prayer, he thereby corrected and prepared his heart's desires %0a%3c for the last three blessings. He aroused the Creator's desire for him, for thanks %0a%3c to these last three blessings, he merges with the Creator in Supernal Unity. %0a%3c %0a%3c The "time of desire" is an appropriate state for making requests and receiving %0a%3c the answer— the strength for self-correction. The King and Queen are ZA and %0a%3c Malchut. Each blessing constitutes a sequence of individual corrections of man's %0a%3c soul. Consequently, man ascends to a Higher spiritual level. Thus, he gradually %0a%3c attains Supernal Unity with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, he must fall on his face, and when Malchut holds the souls within %0a%3c her, submit his soul to the Creator's absolute power, as this is the appropriate %0a%3c time (state) to entrust one's soul amongst all the other souls, for Malchut is the %0a%3c source of life. %0a%3c %0a%3c To fall on one's face and entrust one's soul means that man has but a %0a%3c single desire— to completely rid himself of his egoistic desires, and receive the %0a%3c Creator's altruistic desires in their stead. Upon receiving the Creator's desires, %0a%3c man becomes similar to Him, and to the extent of his similarity, he merges with %0a%3c the Creator. By merging with the Creator, man acquires all that the Creator has: %0a%3c immortality, complete knowledge of all creation, might, and perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c The secret of the Light is available only to the chosen ones: when Malchut %0a%3c holds human souls by her single desire to merge with the Creator (because the %0a%3c same desire fills man's heart), he submits himself entirely to the aspiration for %0a%3c this merging, so as to include his soul in the collective merging between Malchut %0a%3c and the Creator. And if his soul is received by the Creator, man instantly merges %0a%3c with Him and enters the source of life (Tzror HaChaim), both in this world and %0a%3c in the world to come. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 470 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c piritual %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ough Kabbalah is considered a secret teaching, it holds no seer %0a%3c as secret only by those who are yet unable to create the spirit %0a%3c organs within themselves with which to perceive their surroundings. We are %0a%3c the only ones who conceal our surroundings from ourselves in default c %0a%3c corresponding sensory organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c The King (Creator, ZA) and Queen (Malchut) must be connected to the souls %0a%3c on all sides, Above and below, and be adorned with the souls of the righteous %0a%3c (those who wish to merge with the Creator, entrust their souls to Him). And if %0a%3c man directs all the intentions of his heart (desires) to this goal and completely %0a%3c submits his soul to the Creator's will, the Creator makes peace and a covenant %0a%3c with him (both in the Upper Covenant, called Yesod, and in the lower covenant). %0a%3c He blesses Malchut by this peace and covenant, and surrounds her on all sides. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unity on all sides means that the souls attain similarity with the Creator %0a%3c in all their properties. The righteous are those who want to merge with the %0a%3c Creator, attain the entire creation, and as a result, discover the righteousness of %0a%3c Creator, who created and thus governs them. Those who wish to justify %0a%3c %0a%3c "righteous." %0a%3c %0a%3c gh they have not yet reached this state and are only er %0a%3c if only at the very beginning of their path, and they are yet to corre %0a%3c even a single desire and only feel the smallest aspiration to draw closer %0a%3c the Creator, they are already called "righteous," after this desire. The Creator %0a%3c surrounds Malchut on all sides, and Malchut feels Him with all of her corrected %0a%3c properties, sensations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, man also receives the name Shalom (peace), for he has made a covenant %0a%3c with Malchut below, similar to the covenant of the Sefira Yesod Above. And when %0a%3c such a man leaves our world, his soul rises through all the Heavens and none %0a%3c stand in its way, and the Creator calls for it and says: "Let Peace come." The soul %0a%3c reveals the thirteen elevations of the holy peach and no one stands in its way. %0a%3c Hence, happy is he who makes an offering to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c As soon as the soul tears itself from egoism altogether, it completely merges %0a%3c with the Creator and is no longer obliged to descend into this world, clothe in a %0a%3c physical body, and receive an additional portion of egoistic desires. An offering %0a%3c to the Creator signifies rejection of the body's egoistic desires; it is called a %0a%3c "sacrifice," for our body is no different from that of an animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the aspiration to rid oneself of the animate body and its desires %0a%3c is called an "offering." Depending on the kind of desires man is already able %0a%3c to wish to rid himself of, his offering takes the form of a bird (one part of his %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Intention in the Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 471 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c desires) or cattle (another part). Certain parts of The Zohar and some of the %0a%3c ARI's compositions discuss this matter in great detail. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Chiya raised his voice: "Oh, Rabbi Shimon, you are alive, and I was %0a%3c already mourning over you! Yet, it is not you that I mourn for, but for all my %0a%3c friends and for the whole world that will remain orphans after you." Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon is like a torchlight, shining both Above and below. With this Light %0a%3c below, he illuminates the whole world. Woe unto this world when this Light will %0a%3c leave it and rise up Above. Who will shine in this world with the Light of the %0a%3c Torah? Rabbi Aba rose, kissed Rabbi Chiya, and said, "If such words are within %0a%3c you, I thank the Creator for sending me to you, so that I could be closer to you. %0a%3c How happy I am with my lot!" %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the characters described in The Zohar are spiritual objects, Partzufim. As %0a%3c does the whole Torah, The Zohar speaks only of things that exist in the spiritual %0a%3c worlds, rather than in our world. Therefore, all of the objects, animals, plants, %0a%3c and people described in The Book of Zohar constitute spiritual degrees, desires, %0a%3c and Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Creator deliberately sends into our world special souls that are close to %0a%3c elp all the others to attain the spiritual in this lifetime, while they are %0a%3c in this world. These great Kabbalists serve as guides for those who have realiz %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Yehudah said after him: When the Creator told Moshe to choose %0a%3c among the people those who are wise and understanding, Moshe looked at the %0a%3c people and could not find any. Then he was instructed to pick the heads of the %0a%3c tribes who were known for their wisdom. The word "understanding" is not used %0a%3c here, for the degree of the understanding is higher than that of the wise. What is %0a%3c the difference between one who is wise and one who understands? Wise is one %0a%3c who learns from a Rav (Teacher) and wants to attain wisdom. Wise is one who %0a%3c knows all that he has to know. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who understands consists of several levels-degrees, for he sees into every %0a%3c thing and knows for himself and for others. The mark of him who understands %0a%3c is formulated in the phrase: "The righteous one knows his animal soul." The %0a%3c righteous one signifies Yesod that passes the Light to Malchut (animal), for the %0a%3c Gematria of HaVaYaH of Malchut is fifty-two = BON = BeHeMaH (beast) = Bet- %0a%3c HeyMem-Hey = 2 + 5 + 40 + 5 = 52. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the level called "wise at heart," as wisdom is found %0a%3c within the heart. But he who understands, sees Above and below, for himself %0a%3c and for others. He who is wise designates Malchut, for it is Malchut that reveals %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 472 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c wisdom. He who understands is Yesod that stands above Malchut. Ohr Hochma %0a%3c in Malchut shines only from below upwards. It is impossible to receive the Light %0a%3c from Above downwards, as it would surely enter egoistic desires. Therefore, it %0a%3c is said that the wise (Hacham) sees only for himself, from himself upwards, and %0a%3c cannot pass the Light to others below. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said that wisdom is found within the heart, as the heart receives %0a%3c from below upwards; whereas he who understands (the Sefira Yesod, Tzadik, %0a%3c the righteous one) shines with the Light of Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, from Above %0a%3c downwards. He sees that he receives for himself, and shines upon the others, i.e., %0a%3c shines upon Malchut, as it is written: "The righteous knows his animal soul." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here The Zohar speaks about the prayer, which every man offers his Creator %0a%3c (Veyikahel, pp. 32-52). This inner action of man constitutes his greatest and most %0a%3c valuable work in his efforts for the Creator's sake. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator made man at the farthest, completely opposite spiritual le %0a%3c His: with only the egoistic will to enjoy. And since man has no other properti %0a%3c desires but the egoistic will to receive pleasure, not only is he unable to chang- %0a%3c himself, he cannot even wish for the desire to change. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can change only under the influence of the Creator's Light, by receivin %0a%3c His properties from Him. Hence our only task is to cultivate a desire to change. %0a%3c As soon as this true desire appears within man, the Creator will immediately %0a%3c jive him the strength needed for its realization. So the problem is not how %0a%3c %0a%3c )rayer; it is, rather, how to attain it, how to formulate one's reque %0a%3c le strength to become like the Creator! %0a%3c %0a%3c A prayer is a sensation, a desire in one's heart. Man does not re; %0a%3c completely and cannot describe it, for the sensation in one's heart is %0a%3c not subject to any control and conscious correction— it cannot be "created" by %0a%3c one's own will. The sensations in one's heart constitute the consequence of %0a%3c man's mental and spiritual condition, the result of the current degree of his %0a%3c spiritual development. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the desire to change is also in the Creator's hands. However, He %0a%3c us the opportunity to stimulate this process and to determine our own %0a%3c lal advancement: %0a%3c %0a%3c )balists to write books, and when we read them %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lows %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c develop the desire to draw closer to Him; %0a%3c - He allows some of the true Kabbalists to be revealed to a wide circle %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 473 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 474 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Indiscernibly, He transforms our desires (modifies our souls) so %0a%3c lly take an interest in spirituality; %0a%3c %0a%3c le changes our desires with regard to this world, helping us realize %0a%3c insignificance and transience through sensations of disappoint %0a%3c md suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3y creating man a worthless egoist, i.e., by making a worthless creation that %0a%3c is seemingly so unbefitting Him, the Creator allowed man to create himself and %0a%3c elevate himself to an equal degree to that of the Creator Himself— to attain His %0a%3c svel of perfection. Thus, the Creator reveals the perfection of His creatior %0a%3c y\i He created man a worthless creature, He thereby enables him to ma %0a%3c Creator" of himself (in his properties). %0a%3c %0a%3c innot claim that although he is created with only one desire %0a%3c unable to induce the reception of an altruistic desire instead of his natura %0a%3c egoistic one. The Torah, Kabbalah, teachers, and suffering are all prepared to %0a%3c accelerate his advancement toward the goal of creation by the path of the Torah, %0a%3c or otherwise, the path of suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the path of suffering is not only undesirable for man, whose life %0a%3c on earth makes him feel as though he is caught between the millstones %0a%3c tirelessly revolving mill. Ruthlessly and methodically, it pulverizes hir %0a%3c mentally and physically, to the very last day of his life. But this painful path is %0a%3c equally undesirable in the eyes of the Creator. After all, His goal is to delight %0a%3c man, which is in accord with the path of the Torah— a quick and painless way to %0a%3c transform our desires from egoistic into altruistic. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since only the Creator can accomplish this (and He will, either painfully %0a%3c or painlessly, in accord with our conscious request), the development of sue! %0a%3c request toward Him is all that man must do in his life. It is hence written: "I %0a%3c him pray all day long!" Yet, we now understand that this phrase does not spe %0a%3c of sitting over a prayer-book, but refers to man's inner work on himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are various forms of work that man must do in action, with his body, %0a%3c as in the case of physically observing the Mitzvot. And then there is man's inner, %0a%3c most important work, when observance of the Mitzvot depends on the words %0a%3c and desires of the heart. %0a%3c %0a%3c Never does Kabbalah allude to or even mention our physical body, for it %0a%3c is no different from the body of an animal— it is born, functions, and dies as %0a%3c an animal. And all the various forms of work that the body performs are mere %0a%3c mechanical actions utterly unconnected to man's inner intention, and can even %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nose me %0a%3c nes of a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 475 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c fore, the body's actions are completely disregarded in Kabba %0a%3c 's desire is taken into account and is regarded as an action. In itself %0a%3c d off the physical body (in which it presently exists), it constitutes %0a%3c iritual action. %0a%3c %0a%3c lal world is a world of incorporeal desires that have no voh %0a%3c size, movement, or time. Just as in our imagination, where our desires are %0a%3c fulfilled instantly by the power of thought, everything in the spiritual world is %0a%3c determined only by our desires-thoughts, and not by physical actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, since in this world we temporarily exist in a physiological body, %0a%3c our task is to observe the Creator's Mitzvot both physically (with our body) and %0a%3c spiritually. Physically, we can observe them, as a person usually does— because %0a%3c of his upbringing or for a reward in this world (money, health, luck, peace, and %0a%3c so forth) or in the world to come (the best that he can imagine). Alternatively, %0a%3c he performs these actions because he was taught from childhood to do so %0a%3c mechanically, so he cannot avoid doing them in view of the acquired desire %0a%3c (instinct)— if he does not do them, he suffers. %0a%3c %0a%3c This feeling of suffering is exactly what compels him to carry out the %0a%3c mechanical actions of the Mitzvot. It is not even the desire to receive a reward %0a%3c in this world or in the world to come: in this case, the reward is instantaneous- %0a%3c man feels no discomfort, since he does what he is accustomed to do. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, it seems to such a man, who observes the Mitzvot because of the %0a%3c acquired nature (habit), that he demands no reward for his actions either in %0a%3c this world or in the world to come. After all, he truly does not think about any %0a%3c reward, as his habit, which became his second nature, compels him to perform %0a%3c these actions. If he feels this way, he is absolutely positive that he acts "for the %0a%3c Creator's sake." The fact that his habit, his second nature, compels him to %0a%3c perform the Mitzvot mechanically, escapes his awareness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since our body is no more than an animal, the mechanical %0a%3c fulfillment of the Mitzvot by force of habit or for a reward is quite sufficient for %0a%3c him. There is a difference between those who observe because of upbringing or %0a%3c habit, and those who do it for a reward: the former do not even care whether %0a%3c or not the Creator actually exists; they perform purely mechanical actions that %0a%3c they cannot help performing, for they immediately begin to suffer for lack of %0a%3c habitual actions. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, one who observes the Mitzvot because he has faith in reward and %0a%3c punishment believes in the Creator, His Torah, and His governance, but simply %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 476 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c uses it for his own benefit. By observing the Mitzvot with such an intention %0a%3c and remaining in it all of his life, he, naturally, does not grow spiritually. And %0a%3c he who does not grow in our world is called "still" (inanimate), as we divide all %0a%3c nature into the following levels: still, vegetative, animate, and speaking (human). %0a%3c Therefore, such people are regarded as spiritually still (Domem de Kedusha), but %0a%3c they are already "spiritually" still, as opposed to those who observe mechanically, %0a%3c by force of habit. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Kabbalah, the word "body" implies desire. A desire or a body can be %0a%3c goistic or spiritual (altruistic). The gradual passing of the egoistic body and its %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c : with the altruistic one is called man's "spiritual birth." %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's spiritual growth is designated by an increasingly growing intention %0a%3c to observe the Mitzvot only because such is the Creator's desire. Man observes %0a%3c it only for His sake, completely selflessly, as if no reward of any kind will ever %0a%3c be given to him in return, not even in the form of his own self-content. It is %0a%3c as though the Creator does not know who fulfills His desire, as though man %0a%3c himself is uncertain of whether or not he observes the Mitzvot. Yet, he does it %0a%3c anyway, for such is the Creator's will. %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, the notion of "body" in Kabbalah alludes to man's corrected %0a%3c ;sires, whereas uncorrected desires, without a screen, cannot be used, %0a%3c igh they are not considered body parts, existing beyond the body, %0a%3c considered foreign forces or desires— Klipot (shells). %0a%3c %0a%3c only existing creation besides the Creator is the egoistic will tc %0a%3c lim that was created by Him. This desire can be either egoistic (corrupted) or %0a%3c altruistic (corrected), spiritually pure or impure. All the spiritual forces: angels, %0a%3c Klipot, etc., constitute our uncorrected or corrected desires (the will to bestow %0a%3c delight upon the Creator). Nothing else exists in the universe! %0a%3c %0a%3c There are twelve parts in the spiritual body that perform spiritual actions: %0a%3c two arms and two legs, each consisting of three parts, in all 4 x 3 = 12. These %0a%3c parts of our spiritual body (our desires that were corrected by the screen) observe %0a%3c the positive Mitzvot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just like the body of a spiritual object (Partzuf), man's body is his altruistic %0a%3c desires, in which he can receive the Creator's Light according to his intentions %0a%3c (screen). Man's desires are determined by his intentions. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the work with the intention "for the Creator's sake" is performed by %0a%3c the external body parts: the twelve parts of arms and legs, and by the twelve %0a%3c internal body parts: brain, heart, liver, mouth, tongue, five parts of the lungs, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 477 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c and two kidneys. These inner corrections of the body are meant for reception of %0a%3c the Supernal spirit, Light, inside the body, and represent man's most important %0a%3c work with regard to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c These inner actions are called Mitzvot. They depend on speech, such as a %0a%3c prayer— supplications, blessings, and praises. And he who comes to know this %0a%3c work is happy in all things. Man does not realize that his prayer permeates all %0a%3c the Heavens, rising up to the very pinnacle of the universe and reaching the %0a%3c Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was repeatedly mentioned, not a single word in the Torah speaks of our %0a%3c world, especially not of our body. All the words in the Torah are the Creator's %0a%3c sacred names— the various sensations of the Creator felt by those who attain %0a%3c Him. As we have explained, the attainment and sensation of the Creator is %0a%3c impossible without a screen, an altruistic intention, meaning that all that man %0a%3c desires is to please his Creator. Only the sensations in the heart (the essence of %0a%3c man) can perform this work, and never the physiological organs of our animate %0a%3c body, which is no different from that of an animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the morning Light begins to shine, separating Light from darkness, %0a%3c a call pierces through all the Heavens: prepare for the opening of entrances and %0a%3c chambers, and each go to your position. For the ones that serve at night are not the %0a%3c ones that serve in the daytime. And when the night comes, the daytime servants %0a%3c are once more replaced by the nighttime ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the morning Light begins to shine— when man begins to realize that %0a%3c his egoistic desires are death and darkness, whereas altruism and spirituality are %0a%3c life and Light, the Light within man thereby separates from darkness, and he %0a%3c begins to analyze and realize his states, to feel spiritual ascents and descents— he %0a%3c feels his proximity to the Creator as Light, while remoteness from Him and %0a%3c descents into his egoistic desires feel like darkness. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one can feel it only if he feels the Creator (even if only a little, %0a%3c even if indistinctly). To start feeling the shame of receiving from the Creator and %0a%3c e insignificance of one's nature (the sensation of darkness), one must first feel %0a%3c e Creator. Only His Light contains all that man needs: strength for correction, %0a%3c ■.sires, life. Hence, the main thing to which man must aspire is the sensation of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The forces that serve in the daytime are called the "rulers, the government of %0a%3c the day," and the forces that serve at night are called the "rulers, the government %0a%3c of the night." As soon as the morning call is heard, they all take their positions, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 478 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut and Israel descend and enter the Beit-Knesset (the House of Assembly— %0a%3c a place, where all of man's wishes are collected; hence, it is called the house of %0a%3c prayer) to exalt the Creator and begin their singing and blessings. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written: "We shall praise Your mercy in the morning and Your faith at %0a%3c night." Feeling the Creator's Light descending upon him, man perceives it as %0a%3c morning that comes after the darkness, and upon feeling such a state, he praises %0a%3c the Creator in his heart. All alien thoughts retreat before the influence of the %0a%3c Creator's Light, and all impure desires become restrained. %0a%3c %0a%3c After man has corrected himself in the positive Mitzvot (in the first part, %0a%3c in the corrections of Tzitzit and Tefillin), he must unite all of his heart's desires %0a%3c in inner work (in the second part), and wholeheartedly dedicate himself to the %0a%3c work of praises, since speech rises upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is impossible to offer a brief explanation of the Mitzvot of Tefillin and %0a%3c Tzitzit, observed only by those who spiritually attained the level of Partzuf ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c These servants, who stood in their places in the air, are appointed to rule %0a%3c over the four sides of the world. Gazaria soars in the air to govern the East, and %0a%3c all the others that are appointed are together with him, and await the words of %0a%3c the prayer that rises on that side from below. And this ruler takes the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the words of a prayer are proper, then all these rulers absorb them and %0a%3c rise with them to the firmament, where the other rulers stand. Upon absorbing %0a%3c these words, they proclaim, "Blessed be Israel. Blessed be the lips that utter %0a%3c these words!" %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters that were hanging in the air then fly up and form the holy %0a%3c name that rules in the air and consists of twelve letters. This is the name by %0a%3c which Eliyahu flew before rising up to the sky. The letters fly up in the air, %0a%3c and the ruler, who holds the keys to the air in his hand, rises to Heaven along %0a%3c with all the other rulers, and pass the letters into the hands of another ruler %0a%3c for further ascent. %0a%3c %0a%3c After Malchut had been separated from ZA, ZA filled himself with only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim and became the right line, whereas Malchut formed the left line. These %0a%3c two lines are in conflict with one another, just as the right and the left lines of %0a%3c Bina oppose one another. This continues until ZA ascends to Bina as the middle %0a%3c line, balances the right and the left lines, and makes peace between them by %0a%3c uniting them in a single, middle line. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, ZA and Malchut, the two opposite lines, need a middle line to %0a%3c balance them, to bring them balance and peace, and to unite them. This occurs %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 479 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c with the help of MAN (Mei Nukvin), the prayers of the righteous, for they offer %0a%3c up the desires from this world. Also, the screen that they raise is called the %0a%3c Masach (screen) de (of) Hirik— the middle line— causing the left and the right lines %0a%3c to unite, and Malchut to unite with ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, a prayer becomes a request, MAN, and the middle line that leads to %0a%3c peace and unity between ZA and Malchut. Just like Yesod Above (the middle line) %0a%3c unites the Creator with the Shechina-Malchut by gathering all the created souls, %0a%3c man's prayer creates the middle line and unites all by its ascent— bringing peace %0a%3c and unity between the Creator and the Shechina (His creatures), the unity of %0a%3c souls with their Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, just like the Sefira Yesod Above, man, too, is called Shalom (peace). %0a%3c Moreover, the world below precedes and determines the world Above, for the %0a%3c awakening from below (requests of the lower ones) precedes and evokes the %0a%3c awakening from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - except 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c imagine derives only from these two spiritual forces. Man's desire is called a %0a%3c "prayer," for intentionally or unintentionally, this desire appeals to the One %0a%3c who created man, to the Creator. Spiritually, man develops in accordance %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c w %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ithh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, one's true prayer is his request for spiritual correction and elevation. %0a%3c Such a prayer, a desire in the heart, can be achieved only by consistent study %0a%3c of Kabbalistic sources, which affect man's egoistic desire with their concealed %0a%3c inner Light, and evoke him to ascend spiritually ("Introduction to The Study of %0a%3c Ten Sefirot," item 155). %0a%3c %0a%3c A soul is none other than man's corrected, altruistic desire, his spiritual %0a%3c Partzuf, his desire to receive the Creator's Light with the screen (intention) "for %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's speech in a prayer is none other than parts of his soul (the soul itself) %0a%3c clothed in a body. A prayer is man's soul in this world, VAK de Nefesh of Malchut %0a%3c de Malchut within Malchut de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 480 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c World of AK %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c World of Beria %0a%3c World ofYetzira %0a%3c World of Assiya: Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut=K + H + B + ZA+M %0a%3c %0a%3c K+H+B+ZA+M %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR + VAK = Soul of Man %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, how can one's prayer, his desire, rise through all the degrees of all %0a%3c the worlds of BYA and reach Malchut de Atzilut so as to become MAN and the %0a%3c middle line, uniting Malchut with ZA? After all, it is well known that no degree %0a%3c can rise above itself, let alone make such an incredible leap from the lowest %0a%3c degree of the spiritual ladder (our world) to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c To understand that, we must first thoroughly understand the meaning of %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina. As a result of this ascent, each degree splits into two %0a%3c parts: Keter and Hochma of each degree remain within it, while Bina, ZA, and %0a%3c Malchut fall to a lower degree. This occurs because Malchut ascended to Bina and %0a%3c thereby created in Bina a new Sof (end) of the degree. This is because Malchut %0a%3c exists under the prohibition of the first restriction, and hence cannot receive the %0a%3c Light. Due to the second restriction, Bina, ZA, and Malchut are located below %0a%3c the new Sof of the degree. Thus, being below Malchut that ascended to Bina, they %0a%3c are defined as a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina =Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA = Hotem ) Together they are called AHP (Awzen-Hotem-Peh) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut = Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Together they are called GE (Galgalta-Eynaim) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa = Ascended Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 481 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, through the MAN raised by the lower ones, the Light AB-SAG %0a%3c descends and gives strength to Malchut, which stands in Bina, to descend to her %0a%3c own place: Malchut descends from Bina to her own place, thereby returning all %0a%3c the Sefirot to their places and uniting them all into one degree, consisting of %0a%3c ten whole Sefirot. Consequently, Bina and ZON, which were below each degree, %0a%3c return to their degree, to their previous level. Thus, each degree restores itself %0a%3c back to ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, although Malchut, who stood in Bina as the new Sof (end) of the %0a%3c degree, returns from Bina to her own place at the end of every ten Sefirot, this %0a%3c new Sof that she created in Bina does not entirely vanish from Bina. As a result, %0a%3c Bina and ZON do not descend to their place. Instead, they must rise above the %0a%3c new Sof and there create the left line with regard to Keter and Hochma, which %0a%3c never fell from their degree and constitute the right line. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the new Sof remains in its place in all the degrees even after %0a%3c Malchut 's descent from Bina. And this Sof is called the "firmament," while Bina %0a%3c and ZON, which fell from their degree, but now have returned to it, are called %0a%3c "air." For each lower degree is defined as VAK (called Avir— air) with regard to %0a%3c the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Bina and ZON fell from their degree, they became as VAK (air) with %0a%3c regard to it, as the entire lower degree with regard to the Upper. And after %0a%3c the descent of Malchut from Bina, the air (Bina and ZON) that was under the %0a%3c firmament rises above it and becomes the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Bina and ZON ascend above the firmament, they take with them %0a%3c the lower degree, where they existed when they were below, and elevate it along %0a%3c with them above the firmament. It is so because unlike our world, there are no %0a%3c ascents and descents in the spiritual; a descent constitutes the deterioration of %0a%3c one's properties from one spiritual level to a lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa (Firmament) - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c = Awzen %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP (Air) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 482 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, being equivalent in properties with the lower degree, when Bina and %0a%3c ZON ascend together, they take the entire lower degree along with them. For %0a%3c after being together once, and having become similar, they receive help, ascend, %0a%3c and never part again. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ultimately, Malchut's ascent to Bina forms an entrance, an opening, a gate %0a%3c for the lower degree, through which it can ascend to the Upper One. Hence, %0a%3c when Malchut descends from Bina, thus allowing the lower part, AHP de Bina, to %0a%3c ascend, the lower degree can rise along with the ascending AHP de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEof the Upper One %0a%3c %0a%3c Firmament %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c The entire %0a%3c level ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c ascends %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of the Upper One (Air) %0a%3c & GE of the Lower One %0a%3c %0a%3c Land or Earth of the Upper One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA / AHP of the Lower One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina and her subsequent descent due %0a%3c to the influence of Ohr AB-SAG, three parts were formed in each degree: %0a%3c %0a%3c - Air, Bina and ZON that fell down; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The firmaments, the new ends of degrees that appeared through %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina. These never disappear, even if Malchut %0a%3c returns to her place; %0a%3c %0a%3c - The entrances for the lower degrees that were formed through %0a%3c Malchut's ascent to Bina, when the lower degree ascends along with %0a%3c her. Without it, the lower degree can never reach the Upper One, for %0a%3c no degree can ascend above itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process is described in the Chassidic tales as the mission of a righteous %0a%3c one (the Upper Degree) in our world: to descend to the most vile and corrupt %0a%3c people (the lower degree). In other words, while essentially remaining itself, %0a%3c the Upper Degree should corrupt its properties so as to equalize with the lower %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 483 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c :gree. Thus, it shows to the lower ones that in its desires, thoughts, and actions, %0a%3c is the same as them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, when he completely unites with them, and they fully trust him, %0a%3c e becomes "one of them" (designating the union of AHP of the Upper %0a%3c ith GE of the lower one), he gradually, inconspicuously or openly, begins to %0a%3c correct them— by his own example, he propagates his thoughts to them. These %0a%3c thoughts cannot be perceived from an outsider, but only from "one of their %0a%3c hat is, the Upper One receives additional Light (strength) in its GE %0a%3c le to raise its own AHP, correct its desires of reception, start wo %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And since there is no distinction between the desires of AHP of the Upper %0a%3c One and GE of the lower one, into which AHP of the Upper One fell, they both %0a%3c rise together. This way, the Upper One elevates, i.e., improves, corrects a certain %0a%3c part of the lower one's properties (GE), and elevates them to its true level. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the most important thing in our state is to come to feel AHP of %0a%3c the Upper Degree, located at the very center of our heart, and to become equal %0a%3c with it in our properties so as to afterwards rise together with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process is described in the book Attaining the Worlds Beyond, which %0a%3c provides a more personal perspective of this spiritual process: %0a%3c %0a%3c Inside the internal sensations of the Kabbalist exists a part of the Higher %0a%3c evel, of the future state (AHP). One who perceives a Higher Spiritual Level ; %0a%3c 1 unattractive vacuum, rather than a state full of Light, does not receive %0a%3c ler level. %0a%3c %0a%3c en though the Higher Level is full of Light, the lower level perceives %0a%3c ;r only to the degree that the lower qualities permit one to do so. Since the %0a%3c present qualities are not sufficient to receive the Higher Light, the individual %0a%3c does not perceive it. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can perceive the Upper Level because all the spiritual steps are arranged %0a%3c sequentially from lowest to highest. Moreover, the subsequent states overlap %0a%3c th one another; the lower half of the Higher state is situated within the Upper %0a%3c er state (AHP of Upper falls into GE of lower). %0a%3c %0a%3c , the lowest part of our Upper State is always present within us, %0a%3c usually not felt by us. The Upper State above us is referred to as "the Creator" %0a%3c functions as the Creator for us. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It gives birth to us and it gives us life and guidance. Since we do not ha %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 484 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c iin over al %0a%3c freely. %0a%3c %0a%3c can see only One Truth, %0a%3c rates in everything and in everyone. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the Will of the Creator is to grant each human being a free will, then %0a%3c the concealment of the Creator from His creations is necessary. Only if He is %0a%3c hidden can we argue that we can aspire of our free will to attach ourselves to the %0a%3c Creator— to act for His sake, without any trace of self-interest. %0a%3c %0a%3c le entire process of self-correction is possible only when the Crea %0a%3c lied from us. As soon as He reveals Himself to us we immediately 1 %0a%3c servants and fall into the control of His thought, grandeur and pc %0a%3c %0a%3c that point, it is impossible to determine what our true thoi %0a%3c rder to allow us to act freely, the Creator has to conceal Hir %0a%3c %0a%3c On the other hand, to give us a chance to break free from the blind slave %0a%3c of egoism, the Creator must reveal Himself. This is so because a human being %0a%3c obeys only two forces in this world: the force of egoism— the body— and the force %0a%3c of the Creator— altruism. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows, then, that alternating the two states is necessary. These states are %0a%3c the concealment of the Creator from us when we perceive only ourselves and %0a%3c the egoistic forces governing us, and the revelation of the Creator when %0a%3c power of the spiritual forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c l order for one who is still under the influence of egoism to percei %0a%3c Upper Object (the Creator), the Creator must equalize some of His %0a%3c qualities with those of the lower being— the person seeking a connection with %0a%3c the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c He will endow some of His altruistic qualities with egoistic attributes, and %0a%3c can then come into balance with the person seeking connection with Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Upper Part elevates the Malchut-Midat HaDin to the level of His Galgalta %0a%3c ve Eynaim. As a result, His AHP acquires egoistic qualities. In this manner, His %0a%3c AHP "descends" to the lower part (the spiritual level of the seeker) and comes %0a%3c into a state of equivalence with the qualities of the lower part. %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially the lower part was not able to perceive the Upper Spiritual State. %0a%3c However, because the Creator hid His highest altruistic qualities behind egoistic %0a%3c ones, He was able to descend to the level of the person so that the person was %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the ego: %0a%3c the pow %0a%3c %0a%3c In ( %0a%3c %0a%3c closest %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ves and %0a%3c we feel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 485 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that %0a%3c a the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c re or %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c se we perceive higher qualities as being egoistic, we are unable to truly %0a%3c essence. It appears that there is nothing positive in the spiritual tha %0a%3c asure, inspiration, confidence, or tranquility. %0a%3c %0a%3c precisely at this point that we have an opportunity to exercise %0a%3c llpower. We may, instead, declare that the absence of pleasure and taste in %0a%3c spiritual and in Kabbalah is because of the Creator's deliberate concealment for %0a%3c our own sake. Because we do not yet possess the necessary spiritual qualities, it %0a%3c is therefore impossible for us to perceive the Upper spiritual pleasures; rather, %0a%3c our earthly desires are governed by egoism. %0a%3c %0a%3c tied for beginners to understand that they are given depression %0a%3c %0a%3c m. %0a%3c %0a%3c relief to the Creator, they may study, or %0a%3c t such people do not experience pleasure %0a%3c aspirations is directed from Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c This gives them the free will to conclude that their lack of pleasure comes %0a%3c from a lack of appropriate altruistic qualities in themselves. Hence, the Upper %0a%3c One must hide His true qualities from them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, we must remember that the first stage of perceiving the spiritual %0a%3c is the feeling of spiritual deprivation. If the lower part is capable of realizing that %0a%3c the Upper One is concealing Himself because of their incongruity of qualities, %0a%3c and if that lower part asks for help to correct its own egoism by raising a p %0a%3c (MAN), then the Upper Part partially reveals Himself (lifts His AHP) and display: %0a%3c His true qualities, which prior to this moment, were disguised beneath egi %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result, spiritual pleasure also becomes apparent. Thus, the lower part %0a%3c begins to experience the grandeur and the spiritual pleasure felt by the Higher %0a%3c Being, Who possesses spiritual altruistic qualities. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because the Upper Part elevated His altruistic qualities in the eyes of the %0a%3c individual, He thus elevated the individual to the middle of His State (He lifted %0a%3c GE of the lower together with His own AHP). %0a%3c %0a%3c This spiritual state is known as a person's "lesser spiritual level" (Katnut). %0a%3c e Upper Part, in a way, elevates the lower part to His own spiritual level by %0a%3c ing both His grandeur and the grandeur of altruistic qualities. By seeing %0a%3c magnificence of the spiritual and comparing it to the material, we may %0a%3c ally rise above our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c en we perceive the spiritual, regardless of our will, our egoistic qualities %0a%3c ged into altruistic ones, that is, into the qualities of the Creator. In %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 486 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ow the lower part to take complete possession of the Higher %0a%3c pper Part wholly reveals Himself and all His qualities to that lc %0a%3c g He reveals his Grandeur, makes Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c point, the person perceives the Upper Part as the One anc %0a%3c overeign of everything in the universe. At the same time, the %0a%3c part grasps the highest knowledge of the purpose of creation and %0a%3c Upper's dominion. %0a%3c %0a%3c It becomes clear to the lower part that there is no other way to conduct %0a%3c oneself than in the way prescribed by Kabbalah. Thus, the lower part's reason %0a%3c now requires proper action. As a result of this clear awareness of the Creator, %0a%3c one must deal with the contradiction between faith and knowledge, between %0a%3c right and the left lines. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Now, having acquired altruistic qualities (Katnut), the lower part prefers to %0a%3c )roceed only by means of faith in the strength of the Creator. This serves as %0a%3c ication of the seeker's sincere desire to come closer to the Cres %0a%3c %0a%3c ;r, the Creator's revelation of His grandeur (Gadlut) nov %0a%3c advancing by faith. Consequently, the individual must willing %0a%3c se with the acquired knowledge. %0a%3c %0a%3c len one pleads to proceed blindly, relying only on one's faith %0a%3c magnificence of the Creator, rather than by realizing His power and grandeur, %0a%3c and only by using reason in proportion to one's faith, the Creator is compelled %0a%3c to limit His disclosure. When such an action compels the Creator to diminish %0a%3c His disclosure of His general dominion, His omnipotence, and His Light (Ohr %0a%3c Hochma), this is called "the screen of Hirik." %0a%3c %0a%3c Through this screen, we are able to diminish the revelation of the Upper %0a%3c reason (the left line) to the point at which this revelation can be balanced with %0a%3c the right line. The correct correlation between faith and knowledge %0a%3c "spiritual balance," %0a%3c %0a%3c idividuals, determir %0a%3c lith and knowledg %0a%3c the middle line." %0a%3c %0a%3c aled knowledge (the left line) that ' %0a%3c our faith (the right line), by proceeding by faith above reason (the middle line) %0a%3c added onto those spiritual qualities that we possessed before, in the state of Katn %0a%3c The newlv acquired spiritual level is known as Gadlut, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ig big ; %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c V? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 487 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c After the first complete spiritual level has been attained, we will bee %0a%3c equal in qualities to the very first (the lowest) state of the spiritual ladder, %0a%3c mentioned earlier, all the states, or steps of the ladder, overlap with each ot %0a%3c %0a%3c Having reached the first level, we may discover the presence of a hi %0a%3c level within us. Using the same principle as when advancing to the first level, we %0a%3c can proceed step by step to the goal of creation— complete unification with the %0a%3c Creator on the Highest level. %0a%3c %0a%3c An essential part of our spiritual ascent is a special process that requires %0a%3c that, on discovering a greater evil within us, we ask the Creator to grant us the %0a%3c trength to overcome that evil. We then receive strength in the form of a greate %0a%3c iritual Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c This continues until we actually reach the original level and size o %0a%3c uls: at that point, our egoism is completely corrected and filled with Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c en we are distracted by outside thoughts, we feel that thoughts obs %0a%3c m ascertaining the spiritual, because our strength and minds are wasted on %0a%3c extraneous concerns, while our hearts become filled with petty desires. At times %0a%3c like this, we lose faith in the fact that only the Kabbalah contains the true life. %0a%3c %0a%3c Once we overcome this condition, we come out of our state and move into %0a%3c the Light, receiving a Higher Light that helps us ascend further. In this manner, %0a%3c our extraneous thoughts work to help us in our spiritual advancement. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can overcome obstacles only with the help of the Creator. We can only %0a%3c ork on something if we perceive some personal benefit in the task. However, %0a%3c odies, hearts and intellects do not understand what benefits can result %0a%3c ism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as soon as we try to make even the slightest altruistic move, we lose %0a%3c all strength of the mind, heart and body. We are left with nothing else but to turn %0a%3c to the Creator and ask Him for help. In this way, unwillingly and without any free %0a%3c choice, we advance toward the Creator until we merge with Him completely. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lower half of the Higher spiritual object is found within the Upper half %0a%3c of the lower spiritual object. In the lower object, the screen (Masach) is found in %0a%3c e eye area. This is known as "spiritual blindness," because in such a state only %0a%3c ; lower half of the Higher object is visible to us, since the screen of the lower %0a%3c iritual object conceals part of the Higher spiritual object. %0a%3c %0a%3c igher spiritual object drops its screen to the lower one, then reveals itself %0a%3c to the lower object, which in turn begins to view the Higher object as the Higher %0a%3c One views itself. As a result, the lower object receives the state of fullness (Gadlut). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 488 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c er object, then, sees that the Higher One is in a "great" state, and %0a%3c igher object's prior concealment and apparent manifestation as %0a%3c lall" state (Katnut), was done exclusively for the benefit of the lower one. In i %0a%3c the lower object could become aware of the importance of the Higher 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c A person in the right line (Kav Yamin) is happy with his lot (Chafetz Hesed). %0a%3c This is called a "small spiritual state" (Katnut), because a person feels no need %0a%3c for the Torah. He does not feel evil, egoism within himself, and without the %0a%3c need for self-correction, he needs no Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, he needs the left line {Kav Smol). He has to critically appraise his stat %0a%3c (Heshbon Nefesh), decide what he wants from the Creator and from himself, ar %0a%3c ;r he understands the Torah and advances toward the goal of creatic %0a%3c le sees his genuine state and is obliged to integrate it in the right line, %0a%3c other words, he has to be content with what he has and be pleased with his sta %0a%3c as if he has everything that he wishes. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the left line, which brings about suffering as a result of the absence of %0a%3c the desired, a need is awakened for the help of the Creator, which comes in the %0a%3c form of Light of the soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the right line, in a state when a person desires nothing for the self, there %0a%3c exists only the Light of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim), the joy from the similarity in %0a%3c spiritual qualities. But this state is not perfect, because it lacks knowledge and %0a%3c the understanding of the inner meaning. In the left line there is no perfect %0a%3c because the Light of Wisdom can illuminate only if there is con %0a%3c qualities between the Light received and the recipient of the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The congruence results in Ohr Hassadim, which is found in the right li %0a%3c Spiritual gains can be made only by having a desire. But the right line has no %0a%3c desire for anything. All the desires are concentrated in the left line. Howeve %0a%3c the desired cannot be received into the egoistic desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, it is necessary to unite these two qualities so that the Light of %0a%3c leasure of the left line can enter the Light of altruistic %0a%3c f the middle line will illuminate thi %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c igr %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e, and tne Lignt ot %0a%3c thout the Light of the right line, the Light of the left is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The ascent from our world, in which we do not consciously perceive AHP %0a%3c of the Upper One, occurs in the following way: %0a%3c %0a%3c All of one's thoughts about the Creator and spirituality constitute his %0a%3c contact with AHP of the Upper One. How can this Upper Partzuf descend to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 489 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c him? Only by equalizing one's desires (properties) with it. All of man's thoughts %0a%3c and desires (or lack thereof), with regard to the spiritual, constitute his contact %0a%3c with the Upper One. When man feels a lack of desire for spirituality, it means %0a%3c that the Upper Partzuf descended and entered him, equalized itself with him; %0a%3c hence, man feels spiritual emptiness. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is precisely in this state of not being drawn to the spiritual that man %0a%3c should tell himself that it only seems to him this way, whereas in truth, by faith %0a%3c above reason, he desires and acts for the sake of nearing the spiritual. In other %0a%3c words, if, in the state when the Upper One "falls" (spiritual values lose their %0a%3c significance) in his eyes, one can nonetheless aspire to spirituality, he thereby %0a%3c binds, connects himself to AHP of the Upper One. This is because AHP of the %0a%3c Upper One deliberately degraded its properties and assumed an outward form %0a%3c similar to the properties (desires) of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, as soon as one can establish contact with AHP of the Upper One %0a%3c (even if it appears to him absolutely unattractive, precisely because it lowers its %0a%3c properties to man's level), this AHP of the Upper One immediately elevates %0a%3c man to its GE. Thus, man ascends to a Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Piercing through the air" means that the air boundary, consisting of Bina %0a%3c and ZON of the Upper Degree, created as a result of Malchut's ascent to Bina, is %0a%3c pierced by Malchut's descent from Bina to her place, for then the air rises above %0a%3c the firmament and reaches GAR (GE) of the degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus occurs the piercing of the firmaments. For the firmaments constitute %0a%3c the borders of new ends, which appeared because the air (Bina and ZON) was %0a%3c pushed off from its own degree to a lower one, and was not allowed to return %0a%3c to its degree. Hence, the firmament is pierced from Malchut's descent, and no %0a%3c longer prevents Bina and ZON from ascending and joining that degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE of the Upper one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Firmament %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c K %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of Upper one (Air) + GE of Lower one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c H %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c B %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP of of the Lower one %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c M %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 490 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Malchut ascended to Bina = firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Malchut descends back. This creates a passage for AHP to its GE. Thus, %0a%3c the entrances for the lower degree are opened: due to Malchut's descent to her %0a%3c place and the piercing through the firmaments, Bina and ZON ascend to a %0a%3c Higher Degree above the firmament together with the lower degree that they %0a%3c were with during their descent. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, the Upper One deliberately opened up the entrances to %0a%3c enable the lower degree to ascend to a Higher Degree, and not for Bina and %0a%3c ZON (AHP of the Upper One), who simply return to their place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light that lowers Malchut from Bina to her own place at the end of the %0a%3c ten Sefirot stems from Partzufim AB-SAG. These are the Partzufim Hochma and %0a%3c Bina of the world of AK. Although the second restriction— Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina— occurred in Partzuf Bina of the world of AK, the Partzufim Bina (SAG) and %0a%3c Hochma (AB) of the world of AK were unaffected by it, and Malchut remains in %0a%3c her place at the end of the ten Sefirot. %0a%3c %0a%3c Only the Creator Himself, meaning the properties of the Light, can correct %0a%3c and transform man's egoistic properties to altruistic. Indeed, man is simply %0a%3c unable to pull himself out of his current state "by his own hair," as from birth %0a%3c he has absolutely no spiritual strength (desires). Hence, only the Upper Light %0a%3c correct him. And it can only be Ohr Hochma, for this is the Light tl %0a%3c itor emanates. Ohr Hochma, unrestricted by Tzimtzum Bet, is locatec %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, when one raises his MAN (prayer), it reaches the Highest %0a%3c Partzufim of the world of Atzilut, which turn to SAG-Bina-Ima (mother), who %0a%3c in turn appeals to AB-Hochma-Aba (father), receives Ohr Hochma from him and %0a%3c passes it to her children— the souls of the righteous, those who wish to become %0a%3c righteous and to ascend spiritually. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when HochmaAB unites with Bina-SAG in the world of AK, this %0a%3c Light (Ohr AB-SAG) descends from Partzuf Bina de AK to Partzuf Bina de Atzilut, %0a%3c called EKYEH = Ale£>h-He;y-Yo%3ciHe;y. Partzuf Bina de Atzilut sends the Light to all %0a%3c the degrees of the worlds of BYA. Upon attaining a particular Partzuf, this Light %0a%3c lowers the Malchut of each degree (that ascended to Bina) from the degree of %0a%3c Bina to her previous place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Starting with AVI, all the Partzufim are in the state of Katnut: AHP of the %0a%3c Upper Partzuf is inside GE of the lower one. The received Ohr Hochma descends %0a%3c to him who raised MAN, thus evoking Gadlut in all the Partzufim, through which %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 491 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the Light descends to him. The Light descends to each Partzuf along his personal %0a%3c path, which is precisely what connects everyone, each soul, to the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c World of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - Galgalta %0a%3c Hochma-AB %0a%3c Bina - SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA-MAEIyon %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - BON Elyon %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter -Atik %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma-AA %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina- AVI = EKYEH %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c World of Beria %0a%3c World of Yetzira %0a%3c World of Assiya %0a%3c Our World %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the name EKYEH is referred to as the ruler of air that moves the %0a%3c boundary of air because of Malchut 's descent from Bina to her previous place. %0a%3c Each degree and each world consists of four Sefirot H-B-ZA-M, each of which %0a%3c Consists of its own individual ten Sefirot, where, as a result of Malchut's ascent to %0a%3c Bina in each degree, Bina-ZA-Malchut of each degree fell to a lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, there are four kinds of airspace in each world that are governed by %0a%3c the three names of EKYEH: EKYEH in the air of Hesed, EKYEH in the air of %0a%3c Gevura, and EKYEH in the air of Tifferet. Malchut receives from them, and all %0a%3c three names govern in her air together. %0a%3c %0a%3c The triple name, EKYEH, comprises twelve letters. This twelve-letter name %0a%3c rules in the air by lowering Malchut from Bina to her previous place, returning %0a%3c Bina and ZON (called "air"), who fell to a lower degree, back to the degree above %0a%3c the firmament. For Malchut's ascent to Bina created an entrance, to enable the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These Partzufim %0a%3c channel the Light of %0a%3c AB-SAG from %0a%3c SAG of AK %0a%3c %0a%3c down to AVI de Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 492 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c lower one rise to the Upper Degree as soon as it opens, i.e., during Malchut's %0a%3c return to her place. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, when the prophet Eliyahu (a particular spiritual degree) wished to %0a%3c soar to the sky, Malchut of each degree ascended to Bina of the corresponding %0a%3c degree, while Bina and ZON of this degree fell to the lower degree, and a %0a%3c firmament was formed between them. It turned out that each degree doubled: %0a%3c now it contained its own degree, as well as Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, %0a%3c who fell and clothed the lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurred at each degree of the worlds of ABYA, down to the lowest %0a%3c one: Bina and ZON of the Sefira Malchut of the world of Assiya fell and emerged %0a%3c in our world below Malchut. Malchut de Assiya ends at its firmament, which is a %0a%3c new end, in Bina. Also, this degree doubled, as Bina and ZON of the Sefira Yesod %0a%3c of the world of Assiya fell and clothed in its degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEde Bina %0a%3c of the World of Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Keter of the World of Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c etc. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Machsom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c / %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHPde Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (GE) of the Human Soul %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c in our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the diagram, GE of man in our world are put in brackets, for he who %0a%3c exists (spiritually, not with his body) at the degree of our world has no desires of %0a%3c bestowal. Hence, it is said that he who exists with his properties in this world, %0a%3c in egoism, has only a point in his heart, from which he can start his spiritual %0a%3c development. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Sefira Yesod of the world of Assiya also ends with its firmament %0a%3c and contains Bina and ZON of the Sefira Hod de Assiya. The Sefira Netzah de %0a%3c Assiya also doubled, and so on up to Bina de Atzilut. This is why the prophet %0a%3c Eliyahu rose up and united with Bina and ZON, who fell from Malchut de Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 493 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to this world. He equalized with them and clothed in them, whereupon they %0a%3c became like him— reached his degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not all ten Sefirot of the world of Assiya are shown in the above diagram, %0a%3c but as it was previously mentioned, each degree is divided into its own GE and %0a%3c AHP. Man's task is to find AHP of the Upper One within him, and connect to %0a%3c it, merge with it in all of his sensations and desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c Subsequently, the twelve-letter name exerted its influence (thanks to the %0a%3c Light AB-SAG), causing Malchut de Assiya to descend from Bina of Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya to its place, Malchut de Malchut, the end of the ten Sefirot. And as before, %0a%3c Bina and ZON ascended to their degree above the firmament of Malchut. And %0a%3c since Eliyahu's properties were already merged with this air (with the ascending %0a%3c Bina and ZON), he rose together with them above the firmament of Malchut, as %0a%3c he was similar to them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c etc. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Hochma %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c "ahp" %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Bina %0a%3c AHP de Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEdeZA %0a%3c AHPdeZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Malchut %0a%3c of the World of Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE de Malchut %0a%3c AHP "de Malc"hut|(GE) of the Human Soul in our World %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c And since he rose above the firmament of Malchut de Assiya, he entered the %0a%3c air (AHP) of Yesod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Yesod that fell down there. %0a%3c Then he merged in his desires with this air and is considered to have clothed in %0a%3c it, for they were previously at the same degree. Then the influence of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name lowered Malchut from Bina of Yesod de Assiya to her place at the end %0a%3c of the ten individual Sefirot of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c After that, Bina and ZON (the air of Yesod) ascended above the firmament %0a%3c of Yesod. And since Eliyahu had already merged with this air, he (man's soul, his %0a%3c desire) too ascended above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, due to his concord %0a%3c with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And because he rose above the firmament of Yesod de Assiya, he met with %0a%3c the air (AHP) of Hod de Assiya, i.e., Bina and ZON of Hod de Assiya that fell down %0a%3c there. Subsequently, he merged in his desires with this air and clothed it, for %0a%3c they were previously at the same place (spiritually similar to one another). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 494 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As soon as man merges in his properties with AHP of the Upper One, the %0a%3c influence of the twelve-letter name (the descent of the Light of AB-SAG from %0a%3c Above) brings Malchut back (gives strength to the screen) to the end of the ten %0a%3c individual Sefirot of Hod de Assiya. And the air, its Bina and ZON, returned to %0a%3c their place above the firmament of Hod de Assiya. They took Eliyahu (man's soul, %0a%3c his desires) with them, for he had merged with them, and they elevated him to %0a%3c the firmament of Hod de Assiya in view of his similarity with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when he was already in the firmament of Hod de Assiya, he met with %0a%3c the air (AHP) of Netzah de Assiya and merged with it in his properties. When the %0a%3c influence of the twelve-letter name (the Light of correction, AB-SAG, that was sent %0a%3c by the Creator) brought Malchut back to her place (Malchut descended from Bina %0a%3c to Malchut of this Sefira, because she received strength from the Light to resist %0a%3c the egoistic desires of AHP and make them altruistic), the air of Netzah ascended %0a%3c above the firmament, and being merged with Eliyahu (man's soul), took him with %0a%3c it. Being already in the firmament of Net^ah, he met with the air of Tifferet and so %0a%3c on, until he ascended with this air above the firmament of Tifferet de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same way, the air (AHP) of each degree rose higher, up to the Highest %0a%3c Degree of the world of Assiya. From there, it rose to Malchut de Yetzira, and from %0a%3c there— one step at a time— along all the degrees of the world of Yet^zra and the %0a%3c world of Beria, up to the Heavens (ZA) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said about the prophet Eliyahu that the Creator's spirit %0a%3c (the Light AB-SAG) elevated him (merged with AHP of the Upper One) to the %0a%3c Heavens: spirit means Ruach, Sefirot Bina and ZON of the Upper Degree, called %0a%3c "air," that fell down to the lower degree. And this air (spirit) elevates one from %0a%3c a lower degree to a Higher One through all the individual degrees, from the %0a%3c lowest degree (So/ de Assiya) up to the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c An Upper Degree is regarded as the Creator of the lower degree: it creates %0a%3c it, vitalizes it with Light, and governs it. At each degree, man considers the next %0a%3c Highest spiritual degree with regard to him as the Creator. As Rabbi Zushe said: %0a%3c "Every day I have a new Creator." In other words, as man ascends to a Higher %0a%3c Degree (which he calls "day" or "Light"), he thereby reveals a new property of %0a%3c the Creator in this Higher Degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c The air of each of the four sides of the world (in Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet- %0a%3c Malchui) has its own rulers, who hold the keys to the activation of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name so as to lower Malchut from Bina to her own place. The ascending %0a%3c order of these four kinds of air is as follows: West-Malchut, East-Ti//eret (including %0a%3c NHY), North-Gei/ura, and South-Hesed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 495 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - SOUTH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NORTH %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - EAST %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - WEST %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not the rulers that raise a prayer (the desire that man feels in the very %0a%3c depths of his heart) from air to air, and then from firmament to firmament. %0a%3c The air raises a prayer from the firmament, each air to its firmament: first, the %0a%3c prayer ascends to the air of the Sefira Malchut de Assiya, i.e., to Bina and ZON %0a%3c (AHP) that fell from Malchut de Assiya down to our world. They resemble the %0a%3c prayer itself, for this air (AHP) is similar to a prayer (the Upper One lowered %0a%3c itself deliberately to equalize its properties with the lower one); hence, they %0a%3c merge as one degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the one that rules there, Zvuliel (Zebuliel), activates the twelve-letter %0a%3c name, which lowers Malchut from Bina de Assiya to her place. This causes the %0a%3c air to return to its degree and rise above the firmament of the world of Assiya. %0a%3c And since the air became similar to the degree of the actual prayer, it also takes %0a%3c the prayer along with it, raising it above the firmament of the Sefira Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya. This is similar to the ascent of Prophet Eliyahu. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer ascended to the firmament of the world of Assiya, it %0a%3c meets the air of Yesod de Assiya that fell there, as in the case of Eliyahu. It also %0a%3c encounters the ruler of the air of the East, Gazaria (Gazardiel), because East %0a%3c designates the Sefira Tifferet (ZA is often called Tifferet, as the properties of this %0a%3c Sefira dominate and determine all the properties of ZA), which includes the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod, for Tifferet includes Sefirot NHY. %0a%3c %0a%3c This ruler activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina %0a%3c de Yesod to her place, which causes the air of Yesod to ascend to its degree, %0a%3c the firmament of Yesod. By merging with the prayer into one degree via %0a%3c equivalence of form, he takes it with him and raises it above the firmament %0a%3c of Yesod. Then, a similar action occurs in the air and firmament of Sefirot %0a%3c Netzah, Hod, and Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer ascended to the firmament of Tifferet, it encounters the %0a%3c Northern air, i.e., Bina and ZON of Gevura de Assiya that fell there. There it %0a%3c unites with this air into one degree. Then the ruler of the North, Petachia %0a%3c (Petahyah), activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina to her %0a%3c place. Consequently, the air returns, ascends to the firmament of Gevura and %0a%3c takes with it the prayer, which merged with it into one degree during its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 496 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has already reached the firmament of Gevura, it meets with %0a%3c the Southern air, Bina and ZON of Hesed de Assiya that fell there, and merges %0a%3c with this air. Then the ruler of the Southern air, named Pisgania (Pesagniyah), %0a%3c Hesed de Assiya, activates the twelve-letter name and lowers Malchut from Bina of %0a%3c Hesed de Assiya to her place. The Southern air returns and ascends to its degree %0a%3c in the sixth firmament, Hesed de Assiya, called "south." %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has reached the sixth firmament, it encounters the air that %0a%3c fell from the seventh firmament, which is Bina that includes GAR, and the prayer %0a%3c merges with this air into one degree. When the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut %0a%3c from Bina (the seventh firmament) to her place, the air returns to its degree (the %0a%3c seventh firmament) and takes the prayer with it, as they merge during its fall. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the prayer has reached the seventh firmament, it encounters the air %0a%3c that fell from Malchut de Yetzira, and merges with it. Next, the general ruler, %0a%3c Sandalphon, who governs the entire world of Assiya, takes it and activates the %0a%3c twelve-letter name, which lowers Malchut from Malchut de Yetzira to her place. %0a%3c And the air ascends and returns to its degree, the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira, %0a%3c takes the prayer with it, and elevates it to the firmament of Malchut de Yetzira. %0a%3c %0a%3c In exactly the same way, the prayer ascends through all seven Heichalot %0a%3c (halls) of the worlds Yetzira and Beria up to the world of Atzilut. This clarifies %0a%3c the question posed in the beginning: how can a prayer ascend from the very %0a%3c lowest degree of the world of Assiya to the world of Atzilut, for no degree can %0a%3c ascend above itself? From the aforesaid, it follows that since the prayer merges %0a%3c with the first air that fell from Malchut de Assiya to our world, it is exactly this %0a%3c air that elevated them to the firmament of Malchut, whereas the air of Yesod %0a%3c de Assiya was elevated to the firmament of Yesod, and so forth. In other words, %0a%3c the air with which the prayer merges and ascends elevates it to Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who falls from Malchut de Assiya to our world descends from the spiritual %0a%3c degree called Malchut de Assiya to the spiritual degree called our world. Of course, %0a%3c this in no way refers to the physical existence in our world. AHP of the Upper %0a%3c Degree are considered fallen when one feels in his heart (in the center of all of %0a%3c his desires) the desire to attain the spiritual, merge with it, and annul his egoistic %0a%3c properties because they harm and impede his advancement. %0a%3c %0a%3c One should not think that the fall of Bina and ZON to our world from the %0a%3c world of Assiya can be experienced by anyone. And only he who felt this way %0a%3c and was then able to make a sufficient amount of quantitative and qualitative %0a%3c efforts, merits being elevated above our world by AHP of the Upper One. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 497 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c On the Southern side (Hesed), there is he who governs the air of that side, %0a%3c and his assistants. His name is Pisgania, and he holds the keys to the air of %0a%3c this side. All those who suffer pray to their Creator from the depths of their %0a%3c broken hearts (the very sensation of suffering constitutes a prayer, and requires %0a%3c no words). If their speech (desires) is worthy, it ascends to the air of this side, %0a%3c and the ruler accepts and kisses it ("embrace," "kiss," and Zivug are forms of %0a%3c spiritual union of Partzufim), and then declares: "The Creator will be merciful %0a%3c and will spare you in His mercy." %0a%3c %0a%3c All of the holy rulers (Ohr Hochma is called holy) and their assistants of that %0a%3c side rise together with him. The letters of the Creator's holy name, of the twelve- %0a%3c letter name EKYEH soar: four letters Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey on each side, which %0a%3c rule the corresponding sides of air. They ascend on this side of the air to the %0a%3c Southern firmament, Hesed (the sixth firmament), to the ruler of the firmament %0a%3c of the Southern side, named Anafiel. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the Northern side (Gevura) there is Petachia, who governs the air with %0a%3c his assistants. If he who prays for his enemies and haters, i.e., for those who %0a%3c make him suffer is righteous, then as the speech of his prayer rises to the air %0a%3c of that side, the ruler accepts his heart's speech and kisses it (unites it with his %0a%3c properties so as to raise it higher). %0a%3c %0a%3c The air that comes from the North stirs and calls upon all the firmaments, %0a%3c and they all take this speech, raise it to the Northern, fifth firmament, kiss %0a%3c it and say: "The Lord will cast your enemies down and take them away from %0a%3c your face." This occurs in the following order: after the governor of the air had %0a%3c accepted the prayer and kissed it, which means that it merged with the degree %0a%3c of the air and the ruler, the air stirs on the Northern side (the new end that %0a%3c Malchut made as she ascended to Bina, called Techum— space, from the word %0a%3c Tohu— chaos), and the twelve-letter name lowers Malchut from Bina of Gevura de %0a%3c Assiya back to her place. %0a%3c %0a%3c The air that fell into the restrictions (Dinim) of this space is aroused by %0a%3c the desire to rise to the firmament of Gevura. Also, all the degrees that merged %0a%3c with it during its fall rise along with it to the firmament of Gevura due to their %0a%3c similarity to it. Similarly, the prayer that was merged with it during its fall ascends %0a%3c along with it to the fifth firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of the ascent (offering up of a prayer) starts from here: it ascends %0a%3c and pierces through the air (AHP), which fell from Malchut de Assiya to our %0a%3c world, and ascends with it to the first firmament, the firmament of Malchut de %0a%3c Assiya. The prayer ascends and approaches the ruler (in its properties), who was %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 498 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c appointed to control the Western side, Malchut. There are nine entrances where %0a%3c the assistants to the ruler, Zvuliel stand. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten Sefirot of Malchut herself have nine (not ten) entrances, for a %0a%3c restriction to receive the Light is imposed on Malchut of the Sefira Malchut, and %0a%3c it is connected to Yesod de Malchut. Hence, Yesod and Malchut of Malchut share %0a%3c the same entrance. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, a question arises: "Why do all the parts of the air have one ruler for %0a%3c the air and a separate ruler for the firmament? For example, on the Eastern side %0a%3c Gazaria controls the Eastern air and Shimshiel controls the Eastern firmament %0a%3c (Tifferet, the fourth firmament). Similarly, Pisgania controls the Southern air on %0a%3c the Southern side, and Anafiel controls the Southern firmament. And on the %0a%3c Northern side, the ruler Petachia governs the Northern air, and Gadriel is in %0a%3c charge of the Northern firmament. So why does only Malchut have one general %0a%3c ruler, called Zvuliel, who governs both the air and the firmament?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason is that due to Malchut's ascent to Bina, Bina and ZON of each %0a%3c degree fall to a lower degree, the degree of air. However, only the lower part of %0a%3c Bina (ZAT or VAK de Bina) falls, whereas Keter, Hochma, and the Upper half of %0a%3c Bina (GAR de Bina) remain at the same degree. Only the lower half of Bina, ZAT %0a%3c de Bina (ZA and Malchut) fell from this degree and became air. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GE %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c q- GAR of Bina %0a%3c Bina ZATofB~ina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c — Parsa = Malchut — %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AHP %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, two separate rulers were needed: one for the Upper Degree %0a%3c remaining above the firmament, and the other— for the lower half of the degree %0a%3c that fell and turned into air. The degree (ten Sefirot) of Malchut, from whom %0a%3c all nine lower Sefirot fell to the lower degree during Malchut's ascent to Bina, %0a%3c retained only one Sefira Keter de Malchut, which remained as a point below %0a%3c Yesod de ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, even this point refers more to the Sefira Yesod, which is superior %0a%3c to Malchut, because its properties are more similar to Yesod. And since all of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 499 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut refers to the properties of air (except for her individual Keter), she has %0a%3c only one ruler. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ruler wishes to act in the firmament in the daylight, but does not %0a%3c receive permission until the moon rises, i.e., until nightfall, when all the rulers %0a%3c and forces emerge. And when the day breaks (the Upper Light starts shining), %0a%3c they all ascend (the spiritual properties become corrected and improve under %0a%3c the Light's influence) to the Highest of the nine entrances, the point of Keter de %0a%3c Malchut, which remained at its degree above the firmament (Parsa). %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends, it enters through this Upper entrance, and all %0a%3c the rulers with their assistants emerge from it, led by their Supreme ruler, Zvuliel, %0a%3c the only ruler of the air of this Upper entrance, who is above the firmament of %0a%3c Malchut de Assiya. They all emerge, kiss the prayer, and accompany it up the %0a%3c second firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut constitutes the left line— Hochma without Hassadim. Therefore, when %0a%3c she dominates, the Light does not shine and darkness prevails. Hochma cannot %0a%3c shine without Hassadim, which means that when Malchut rules, it is nighttime %0a%3c (not daylight). Indeed, all nine of her lower Sefirot, from which all the rulers (of %0a%3c man) and forces (man's desires) of the left side originate, rule at night. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why it is said that Malchut descends from Bina to her place, although %0a%3c her nine lower Sefirot remained untouched by the impure force, for Malchut %0a%3c descended from the firmament, which transformed her into air. Even so, they %0a%3c (nine Sefirot) have no power in her place, and must rise above the firmament to the %0a%3c Upper entrance, Keter de Malchut. There they enter the right side (Hassadim), and %0a%3c the prayer ascends with them because of their similarity (in desires, properties), %0a%3c achieved while they were below the firmament (in the state called "our world"). %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer (MAN) rose above the firmament of Malchut (to GE %0a%3c of the Upper One), it encounters the air (AHP of the still Higher One) that fell %0a%3c there from the second firmament. After the descent of Malchut from Bina of %0a%3c Yesod de Assiya to her place, this air ascends to the firmament of Yesod, and takes %0a%3c with it all the rulers, their assistants, and the prayer, which were merged with it %0a%3c during its fall, and elevates all of them to the firmament of Yesod de Assiya. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends to this firmament (Yesod), the twelve gates %0a%3c of this firmament open up. A special ruler, Ana'el (Anahel), who is in charge %0a%3c of many forces, stands at the twelfth entrance, and when the prayer ascends, %0a%3c proclaims to all the entrances: "Open the gates." And all the entrances open up, %0a%3c and the prayer enters through them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 500 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This happens because Tifferet has twelve borders of the diagonal, defined %0a%3c by the Sefirot H-G-T-M, each of which contains three lines of HGT, twelve in %0a%3c all. And all that exists in Tifferet is also present in Yesod, but there these twelve %0a%3c borders are called "twelve gates," through which the prayer enters. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then awakens a very old ruler, who stands at the Southern side. His %0a%3c name is Azriel-Saba, sometimes referred to as Machaniel, for he is responsible %0a%3c for 600,000 groups (camps— Machanot). All the groups have wings and eyes; they %0a%3c stand and listen to all those who are quietly praying, to the prayers that come %0a%3c from the depths of the heart and are directed only to the Creator. Only such %0a%3c prayers are heard by those who have ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a special opening in the Sefira Yesod de Hesed (Supernal mercy) that %0a%3c descends from the right line of Bina. Hence, the ruler of this mercy is called %0a%3c Azriel-Saba. He is called Saba (grandfather), because Hochma and Bina are called %0a%3c "old men." And he is appointed to rule over 600,000 groups (camps), because %0a%3c 600 = 6 x 100, where 6 = HGT NHY Sefirot in Bina. And since each Sefira in Bina %0a%3c is designated by 100, 6 x 100 = 600. And the thousands stem from Ohr Hochma, %0a%3c which shines in each of these Sefirot. Hence, 600 x 1,000 = 600,000 groups. %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR de Tvuna, the lower part (ZAT) of Bina, are called "ears." Only Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim shines in them, without Hochma. VAK de Tvuna are called "eyes," and %0a%3c Ohr Hochma shines in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut and Bina constitute two kinds of air, West and North, which unite %0a%3c and intermix, and form a diagonal, a combination of judgment and mercy that %0a%3c mitigates strictness and judgment. Hence, they hear good words from one who %0a%3c merits it, i.e., they accept one's prayer to the extent of the mercy in the diagonal. %0a%3c Alternatively, they hear bad things about one who does not merit, accepting %0a%3c one's prayer to the extent of the judgment in the diagonal. %0a%3c %0a%3c If man's ears hear the prayer (which means that he speaks not from the %0a%3c depths of his heart, but with his mouth, so outwardly that his ears hear it, but %0a%3c not his heart), no one will accept it Above. Therefore, man must be watchful: %0a%3c no one should hear his prayer, for the speech of the prayer unites in the Upper %0a%3c World, in ZA, and the speech of the Upper World must not be heard. %0a%3c %0a%3c Consider how the Torah is read: one reads and the others keep silent. %0a%3c However, if they all read it out loud, they lessen the faith Above, for the voice and %0a%3c speech of one mingle with the voice and speech of the others, and undermine %0a%3c faith, i.e., Malchut. The voice and speech (ZA is called "voice" and Malchut is %0a%3c called "speech") of one must be similar to the voice and speech of the other. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 501 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Two reasons are mentioned above as to why a prayer must be speech without %0a%3c voice, unheard by man's ear. The first is that Malchut, who begets people, consists %0a%3c of two points: the Light cannot be received from Malchut with a measure of %0a%3c judgment, whereas the Light can be received from Malchut that is corrected in %0a%3c Bina with a measure of mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, man consists of a combination of these two points. If he merits, %0a%3c the measure of judgment becomes concealed, the measure of mercy is revealed, %0a%3c and he merits receiving the Upper Light. However, if he does not merit, the %0a%3c measure of judgment becomes revealed and the Light disappears from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Upper ear has an inclined form so as to be able to receive the %0a%3c prayer of man-righteous one, him who merits the concealment of the measure %0a%3c of judgment, so that the listening ear would not arouse judgment, concealed %0a%3c in the speech of the prayer. Hence, if an outsider hears the prayer before it %0a%3c ascends, he evokes the judgment concealed in the speech of the prayer, and it %0a%3c cannot be heard Above. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another reason for this: the speech of the prayer constitutes parts %0a%3c of Malchut. And he who prays must be a part of Malchut. Hence, the prayer %0a%3c must ascend and be included in the Supernal Malchut, called "speech." Then %0a%3c Malchut unites with ZA (voice) and the prayer is accepted, i.e., the Light is %0a%3c accepted from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, one must not raise his voice during prayer so as to allow the %0a%3c Supernal voice, the Light of ZA, to descend to the praying person. The speech %0a%3c ascends to Malchut, merges with ZA with the help of Malchut, and receives a %0a%3c completely corrected voice from ZA. As a result, the prayer can receive the Light. %0a%3c It is therefore said that the words of a prayer pronounced by man's voice must %0a%3c not be heard. %0a%3c %0a%3c He who reads the Torah must also be a part of ZA, called "Torah." And the %0a%3c voice of one who reads Torah must be instead of the voice of ZA. Hence, it is %0a%3c forbidden to hear someone else's voice, for it will be the voice of one who exists %0a%3c under judgment, and not under mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, the voice of an outsider harms the voice of one who reads the Torah, %0a%3c and Malchut is unable to receive the Light from ZA. Yet, if this is the voice and %0a%3c speech of one man, then the voice, called ZA, and speech, called Malchut, merge %0a%3c into one combination. But if voice and speech of an outsider join the reader's, %0a%3c it will harm him. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to everything mentioned above, one can say that only he %0a%3c who approaches the described state can understand what The Zohar narrates. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 502 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Spiritual actions are understood in one's heart, his desires, his properties. If %0a%3c they do not correspond to those that are described above, no explanation of any %0a%3c kind will help. An "outsider" designates man's "foreign" (distant from spiritual %0a%3c aspirations) thoughts and desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c When a quiet, concealed, and secret prayer ascends, the governor Azriel- %0a%3c Saba himself and all of his assistants, who are in charge of the 600,000 groups %0a%3c (camps), and all those who have eyes and ears emerge and kiss the ascending %0a%3c word of the prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is said in the verse: "The Creator's eyes and ears are upon them." %0a%3c The Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous. The Creator's eyes refer to those %0a%3c below who have eyes, meaning the angels that exist in the firmament of Yesod de %0a%3c Assiya. They exist Above, at the degree of GAR, for eyes signify the property of %0a%3c Hochma. However, these eyes are the eyes of the Sefira Yesod, as it is written: "The %0a%3c Creator's eyes rest upon the righteous," as Yesod is called the "righteous one." %0a%3c %0a%3c The third firmament is the Sefirot Net^ah and Hod de Assiya. The prayer %0a%3c ascends to this firmament. The ruler Gadria, who controls this firmament with %0a%3c his assistants, acts three times a day during the ascent of the three lines to the %0a%3c world of Atzilut, when the luminous scepter of Light ascends and descends, but %0a%3c does not stay in one place, for Ohr Hochma of the left line (called the "scepter of %0a%3c Light") wants to shine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word "scepter" (Hebrew, Sharvit) signifies eyesight, and Ohr Hochma is %0a%3c called the Light of eyesight. The scepter moves three times and conceals itself, %0a%3c because Hochma reveals itself only when the three lines move in the three points: %0a%3c Holam (the dot above the letters), Shuruk (the dot inside the letters), and Hirik %0a%3c (the dot below the letters). %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer, which is the middle line, ascends and carries the screen of %0a%3c Hirik, the scepter (the Light of the left line) descends and bows its head before %0a%3c the prayer, designating the concealment of GAR, called "head." This is because %0a%3c the middle line reduces the left line with the help of the screen of Hirik. This %0a%3c third firmament of Sefirot Netzah and Hod de Assiya is called the "firmament of %0a%3c the scepter," for the scepter of Light acts within it. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer ascends, the ruler bows his head before it (diminishes his %0a%3c level) and then strikes the iridescent rock with his scepter. The rock stands at the %0a%3c center (the middle line) of the firmament, and 365 hosts emerge from the rock, %0a%3c which were concealed within it since the Torah descended to the earth. Because %0a%3c they objected to this descent, the Creator reproached them, and they concealed %0a%3c themselves in the rock. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 503 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Here, by analogy with the aforesaid and in accordance with the definitions %0a%3c of such notions as a scepter, a rock, hosts, Light, concealment, to %0a%3c bow," the reader is offered an opportunity to translate from the language of %0a%3c legends into the language of spiritual actions. And when the reader attains what %0a%3c is written, he will feel it within him! %0a%3c %0a%3c And they do not emerge from there, except for when the prayer ascends. %0a%3c Then they praise the Creator, saying: "Our Creator, how great is Your name %0a%3c upon the earth!" This prayer is called "Great," because it ascends to all these %0a%3c firmaments, and they bow before it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This occurs because the angels that opposed the descent of the Torah (see %0a%3c the article "Heaven and Earth"), i.e., the middle line, to the earth (Malchut and %0a%3c the worlds of BYA), emerge from the left line. And they wanted the left line to %0a%3c dominate in Malchut and in the worlds of BYA, but not the middle one, called %0a%3c the "Torah," which reduces the GAR of the Light of the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, called "earth," includes all the worlds of BYA. However, the Creator %0a%3c (middle line) reproached and compelled her to receive the Light of the middle %0a%3c line and conceal herself in the rock, in the forces of judgment, which exist in the %0a%3c middle line that stands at the center of the firmament. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the prayer can ascend only by activating the left line, namely Bina %0a%3c and ZON that fell to the lower degree, then ascended once more above the %0a%3c firmament, and became the left line. They take the prayer that existed with %0a%3c them during their descent to the lower degree. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the ruler receives the scepter, the Light of the left line, for %0a%3c during the ascent of the prayer, the left line shines in his domain. The 365 hosts %0a%3c then awaken and receive the Light of the left line from the scepter. Hence, they %0a%3c exclaim: "The Creator, Our Lord, how great is Your name upon the earth!" for %0a%3c the prayer ascends to this firmament, called "Great," and includes the screen of %0a%3c Hirik of the left line, from the GAR. Thus, they bow their heads, i.e., do not use %0a%3c the GAR of Ohr Hochma, but only VAK. %0a%3c %0a%3c Afterward, the prayer clothes in the Supernal adornments and rises to the %0a%3c fourth firmament, Tifferet. Then the sun (Tifferet) emerges at its level, the Supreme %0a%3c ruler Shimshiel, and the 365 hosts ascend to this firmament along with him. %0a%3c They are called "the days of the sun," for these levels stem from the sun, Tifferet. %0a%3c And they all clothe and adorn Malchut in the Heavens of the Garden of Eden. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer pauses there to merge with the air of Gevura of those degrees, %0a%3c because it was not supposed to pause at the previous firmament, NHY, as they %0a%3c are included in Tifferet. And the prayer remains there until all the hosts have %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 504 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c risen with it to the fifth firmament (Gevura), where Gadriel rules; he is in charge %0a%3c of all the hosts of the other nations, for Gevura constitutes the left line, which %0a%3c the other nations hold on to. %0a%3c %0a%3c And when the prayer ascends, carrying within the screen of the middle %0a%3c line (which reduces the left line from GAR to VAK), it shakes him and all of his %0a%3c hosts, and they lose all their strength, emerge and bow their heads, i.e., GAR, %0a%3c and adorn this prayer. %0a%3c %0a%3c They ascend with it to the sixth firmament, Hesed, and the legions and hosts %0a%3c come forth and accept the prayer until they reach the seventy gates, HGT NHYM, %0a%3c each of which consists of ten, as Hesed includes all seven lower Sefirot. The Supreme %0a%3c ruler, Anafiel, stands there and adorns the prayer with seventy adornments. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the prayer was adorned, all the legions and hosts of all the %0a%3c firmaments that accompanied the prayer from firmament to firmament unite %0a%3c and raise the prayer to the seventh firmament, Bina, which includes GAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c The prayer enters the seventh firmament, and the Supreme ruler Sandalphon, %0a%3c who is in charge of all the guards at the entrances, ushers the prayer into the %0a%3c seven halls of the world of Yetzira. These are the seven halls of the King, the %0a%3c seven halls of Malchut de Atzilut, where ZA rules. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the prayer, adorned with all of these adornments, ascends there, it %0a%3c unites ZA with Malchut, for everything grows with similarity to everything else. %0a%3c And the Creator's name, i.e., Malchut is adorned from Above and from below, %0a%3c and on all sides, as Malchut merges with ZA into one. And then Yesod (the %0a%3c righteous one) fills Malchut with its blessings. %0a%3c %0a%3c Happy is the lot of him who can put his prayer in proper order, so the %0a%3c Creator will clothe in this prayer. He waits until all the prayers of Israel finish %0a%3c ascending and unite into a complete and perfect prayer, whereupon everything %0a%3c will become perfect both Above and below. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the prayer, there are the Mitzvot of the Torah that depend on speech %0a%3c and action. There are six Mitzvot that depend on speech: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. To fear the Great and Mighty Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. To love the Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. To bless the Creator; %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. To proclaim the Creator's unity; %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. To bless the nation, which is incumbent on Cohanim (priests); %0a%3c %0a%3c 6. To entrust one's soul with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Raising a Prayer %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 505 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the six above-mentioned Mitzvot, the first finds its place in the %0a%3c blessings that King David sang during his offerings in the Torah, where man %0a%3c must fear his Master, for these songs stand in a place called "fear" or Malchut. %0a%3c And all of these written blessings constitute the essence of fear of the Creator, %0a%3c Malchut. And man must sing these songs with his desires in fear. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man must achieve a level of spiritual development where his desires will %0a%3c coincide with what is said in the texts of these blessings. It is impossible to force %0a%3c someone to wish something; all our feelings are the product, the result of our %0a%3c spiritual level. The Light of that degree influences one's egoism and corrects it %0a%3c with the power of that degree. Therefore, man can only ask for correction, but %0a%3c %0a%3c Here we have a list of degrees that man must gradually go through in his %0a%3c correction. These degrees are usually called Mitzvot, and in all there are 620 of %0a%3c them between us and the Creator: 613 Mitzvot of the Torah for Israel (altruism) %0a%3c and seven Mit^ot of the Torah for all the nations (egoism). Here they are %0a%3c expounded in a different way: since the most important is to ask for correction %0a%3c (and if the request is genuine, the answer in the form of Light immediately %0a%3c descends to it), all of man's work on himself, all of his efforts in the study, work %0a%3c and actions are aimed only at the creation of a true request, MAN. Hence, the %0a%3c stages of man's spiritual development are described as his path in prayer; as if %0a%3c he stands and prays, although this process continues within him throughout his %0a%3c life on earth. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second Mitzva: to love the Creator (as it was repeatedly stated, this %0a%3c feeling is the result of correction; see "Introduction to the Study of Ten Sefirot," %0a%3c item 45— the four degrees of sensation of governance, from darkness to love), %0a%3c when in his prayer one reaches Ahavat Olam (great love) and Le El (for the %0a%3c Creator). These two blessings precede the appeal, Shema Israel (Hear, O Israel) %0a%3c and Ve Ahavta Et (and love the Creator), the blessing of the Creator for one's %0a%3c love for Him that follows the appeal Shema Israel. And this is the secret of love %0a%3c for the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The third Mit^i/a: since man reaches a place in the prayer that is called %0a%3c Lehishtabe'ach (blessed is the Creator), he must attain praises and blessings of the %0a%3c Creator in his desire, as in parts of the prayer Yotzer Ohr (He who creates Light) %0a%3c and Yotzer HaMeohrot (maker of the stars). %0a%3c %0a%3c The fourth Mitzva is to proclaim the Creator's unity, i.e., Shema Israel (Hear, %0a%3c O Israel, our Creator is one!). From this point (degree) on, one must express %0a%3c the secret of the Creator's unity (in all His manifestations to man) in his heart's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 506 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c desire (one's heart must be filled only with the sensation of the One, Upper %0a%3c Force). Afterward, the Mitzva to remember and remind others of the exodus %0a%3c from Egypt (egoism) is observed, as it is written: "Remember how you were a %0a%3c slave in Egypt." %0a%3c %0a%3c The fifth Mitzva is for a Cohen to bless the people (the Light's descent to the %0a%3c Partzuf), so that Israel will be included when the prayer (the Cohanim's blessing) %0a%3c ascends, for at this time (state), Knesset Israel (all those who correct themselves by %0a%3c aspiring to the Creator and constitute a part of Malchut de Atzilut), i.e., Malchut, %0a%3c receives a blessing (Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c The sixth Mitzva and the desired time (state, spiritual level when man wishes %0a%3c only to give all of his desires, i.e., his soul, to the Creator, meaning that he can %0a%3c act for the Creator's sake in all of his desires) is to entrust one's soul with the %0a%3c Creator with complete desire in one's heart. When one falls (willingly accepts %0a%3c the small state) on his face (Hochma) and proclaims (raises MAN): "I entrust my %0a%3c soul with You, O Creator." The intentions and desires of his heart are to give his %0a%3c soul completely to the Creator (this desire is the consequence of this spiritual %0a%3c degree and comes naturally to those who attain it). %0a%3c %0a%3c These six Mitzvot of the prayer correspond to the 600 Mitzvot of the Torah. %0a%3c And the remaining thirteen Mitzvot are required in order to attract the thirteen %0a%3c properties of mercy (thirteen Midot HaRachamim), which include all the rest. %0a%3c The prayer is adorned with 600 Mitzvot, which corresponds to HGT NHY, to %0a%3c what the prayer, Malchut, receives from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Happy is he who heeded and focused his desire on this (who was able to %0a%3c raise a proper request for his correction), who completed all that was required %0a%3c each day (in the Creator's daylight), and directed his heart's intentions and %0a%3c desires to fulfill this Mitzva, which depends on the word. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The End %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c To help you determine which book you would like to read next, we %0a%3c have divided the books into five categories— Beginners, Intermediate, %0a%3c Advanced, All Around, and Textbooks. The first three categories are %0a%3c divided by the level of prior knowledge readers are required to have. The %0a%3c Beginners Category requires no prior knowledge. The Intermediate Category %0a%3c requires reading one or two beginners' books first; and the Advanced level %0a%3c requires one or two books of each of the previous categories. The fourth %0a%3c category, All Around, includes books you can always enjoy, whether you are a %0a%3c complete novice or well versed in Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fifth category— textbooks— includes translations of authentic source %0a%3c materials from earlier Kabbalists, such as the Ari, Rav Yehuda Ashlag (Baal %0a%3c HaSulam) and his son and successor, Rav Baruch Ashlag (the Rabash). %0a%3c %0a%3c Additional translated material that has not yet been published can be found %0a%3c at www.kabbalah.info. All materials on this site, including e-versions of published %0a%3c books, can be downloaded free of charge. %0a%3c %0a%3c BEGINNERS %0a%3c Kabbalah for Beginners %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah for Beginners is a book for all those seeking answers to life's essential %0a%3c questions. We all want to know why we are here, why there is pain, and how %0a%3c we can make life more enjoyable. The four parts of this book provide us with %0a%3c reliable answers to these questions, as well as clear explanations of the gist of %0a%3c Kabbalah and its practical implementations. %0a%3c %0a%3c 507 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 508 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Part One discusses the discovery of the wisdom of Kabbalah, and how it was %0a%3c developed, and finally concealed until our time. Part Two introduces the gist %0a%3c of the wisdom of Kabbalah, using ten easy drawings to help us understand the %0a%3c structure of the spiritual worlds, and how they relate to our world. Part Three %0a%3c reveals Kabbalistic concepts that are largely unknown to the public, and Part %0a%3c Four elaborates on practical means you and I can take, to make our lives better %0a%3c and more enjoyable for us and for our children. %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah Revealed %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a clearly written, reader-friendly guide to making sense of the surrounding %0a%3c world. Each of its six chapters focuses on a different aspect of the wisdom of %0a%3c Kabbalah, illuminating the teachings and explaining them using various %0a%3c examples from our day-to-day lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c The first three chapters in Kabbalah Revealed explain why the world is in a %0a%3c state of crisis, how our growing desires promote progress as well as alienation, %0a%3c and why the biggest deterrent to achieving positive change is rooted in our own %0a%3c spirits. Chapters Four through Six offer a prescription for positive change. In %0a%3c these chapters, we learn how we can use our spirits to build a personally peaceful %0a%3c life in harmony with all of Creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wondrous Wisdom %0a%3c %0a%3c This book offers an initial course on Kabbalah. Like all the books presented %0a%3c here, Wondrous Wisdom is based solely on authentic teachings passed down %0a%3c from Kabbalist teacher to student over thousands of years. At the heart of the %0a%3c book is a sequence of lessons revealing the nature of Kabbalah's wisdom and %0a%3c explaining how to attain it. For every person questioning "Who am I really?" %0a%3c and "Why am I on this planet?" this book is a must. %0a%3c %0a%3c Awakening to Kabbalah %0a%3c %0a%3c A distinctive, personal, and awe-filled introduction to an ancient wisdom %0a%3c tradition. In this book, Rav Laitman offers a deeper understanding of the %0a%3c fundamental teachings of Kabbalah, and how you can use its wisdom to clarify %0a%3c your relationship with others and the world around you. %0a%3c %0a%3c Using language both scientific and poetic, he probes the most profound ques- %0a%3c tions of spirituality and existence. This provocative, unique guide will inspire and %0a%3c invigorate you to see beyond the world as it is and the limitations of your every- %0a%3c day life, become closer to the Creator, and reach new depths of the soul. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 509 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life %0a%3c %0a%3c Science explains the mechanisms that sustain life; Kabbalah explains why life %0a%3c exists. In Kabbalah, Science, and the Meaning of Life, Rav Laitman combines %0a%3c science and spirituality in a captivating dialogue that reveals life's meaning. %0a%3c %0a%3c For thousands of years Kabbalists have been writing that the world is a single %0a%3c entity divided into separate beings. Today the cutting-edge science of quantum %0a%3c physics states a very similar idea: that at the most fundamental level of matter, %0a%3c we are all literally one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Science proves that reality is affected by the observer who examines it; and %0a%3c so does Kabbalah. But Kabbalah makes an even bolder statement: even the %0a%3c Creator, the Maker of reality, is within the observer. In other words, God is %0a%3c inside of us; He doesn't exist anywhere else. When we pass away, so does He. %0a%3c %0a%3c These earthshaking concepts and more are eloquently introduced so that %0a%3c even readers new to Kabbalah or science will easily understand them. Therefore, %0a%3c if you're just a little curious about why you are here, what life means, and what %0a%3c you can do to enjoy it more, this book is for you. %0a%3c %0a%3c From Chaos to Harmony %0a%3c %0a%3c Many researchers and scientists agree that the ego is the reason behind the %0a%3c perilous state our world is in today. Laitman's groundbreaking book not only %0a%3c demonstrates that ego has been the basis for all suffering throughout human %0a%3c history, but also shows how we can turn our plight to pleasure. %0a%3c %0a%3c The book contains a clear analysis of the human soul and its problems, and %0a%3c provides a "roadmap" of what we need to do to once again be happy. From Chaos %0a%3c to Harmony explains how we can rise to a new level of existence on personal, %0a%3c social, national, and international levels. %0a%3c %0a%3c INTERMEDIATE %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kabbalah Experience %0a%3c %0a%3c The depth of the wisdom revealed in the questions and answers within this %0a%3c book will inspire readers to reflect and contemplate. This is not a book to race %0a%3c through, but rather one that should be read thoughtfully and carefully. With %0a%3c this approach, readers will begin to experience a growing sense of enlightenment %0a%3c while simply absorbing the answers to the questions every Kabbalah student %0a%3c asks along the way. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 510 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kabbalah Experience is a guide from the past to the future, revealing %0a%3c situations that all students of Kabbalah will experience at some point along %0a%3c their journeys. For those who cherish every moment in life, this book offers %0a%3c unparalleled insights into the timeless wisdom of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Path of Kahhalah %0a%3c %0a%3c This unique book combines beginners' material with more advanced concepts %0a%3c and teachings. If you have read a book or two of Laitman's, you will find this %0a%3c book very easy to relate to. %0a%3c %0a%3c While touching upon basic concepts such as perception of reality and Freedom %0a%3c of Choice, The Path of Kabbalah goes deeper and expands beyond the scope of %0a%3c beginners' books. The structure of the worlds, for example, is explained in greater %0a%3c detail here than in the "pure" beginners' books. Also described is the spiritual %0a%3c root of mundane matters such as the Hebrew calendar and the holidays. %0a%3c %0a%3c ADVANCED %0a%3c %0a%3c The Science of Kabbalah %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalist and scientist Rav Michael Laitman, PhD, designed this book to %0a%3c introduce readers to the special language and terms of the authentic wisdom %0a%3c of Kabbalah. Here, Rav Laitman reveals authentic Kabbalah in a manner both %0a%3c rational and mature. Readers are gradually led to understand the logical design %0a%3c of the Universe and the life that exists in it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Science of Kabbalah, a revolutionary work unmatched in its clarity, %0a%3c depth, and appeal to the intellect, will enable readers to approach the more %0a%3c technical works of Baal HaSulam (Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag), such as The Study %0a%3c of the Ten Sefirot and The Book of Zohar. Readers of this book will enjoy the %0a%3c satisfying answers to the riddles of life that only authentic Kabbalah provides. %0a%3c Travel through the pages and prepare for an astonishing journey into the %0a%3c Upper Worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Introduction to the Book of Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c This volume, along with The Science of Kabbalah, is a required preparation %0a%3c for those who wish to understand the hidden message of The Book of Zohar. %0a%3c Among the many helpful topics dealt with in this text is an introduction to the %0a%3c "language of roots and branches," without which the stories in The Zohar are %0a%3c mere fable and legend. Introduction to the Book of Zohar will provide readers with %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 511 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the necessary tools to understand authentic Kabbalah as it was originally meant %0a%3c to be, as a means to attain the Upper Worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c The Book of Zohar (The Book of Radiance) is an ageless source of wisdom and the %0a%3c basis for all Kabbalistic literature. Since its appearance nearly 2,000 years ago, it %0a%3c has been the primary, and often only, source used by Kabbalists. %0a%3c %0a%3c For centuries, Kabbalah was hidden from the public, which was deemed %0a%3c not yet ready to receive it. However, our generation has been designated by %0a%3c Kabbalists as the first generation that is ready to grasp the concepts in The Zohar. %0a%3c Now, we can put these principles into practice in our lives. %0a%3c %0a%3c Written in a unique and metaphorical language, The Book of Zohar enriches %0a%3c our understanding of reality and widens our worldview. Although the text %0a%3c deals with one subject only— how to relate to the Creator— it approaches it from %0a%3c different angles. This allows each of us to find the particular phrase or word that %0a%3c will carry us into the depths of this profound and timeless wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c ALL AROUND %0a%3c %0a%3c Attaining the Worlds Beyond %0a%3c %0a%3c From the introduction to Attaining the Worlds Beyond: "...Not feeling well on %0a%3c the Jewish New Year in September 1991, my teacher called me to his bedside %0a%3c and handed me his notebook, saying, 'Take it and learn from it.' The following %0a%3c morning, my teacher perished in my arms, leaving me and many of his other %0a%3c disciples without guidance in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c "He used to say, 'I want to teach you to turn to the Creator, rather than %0a%3c to me, because He is the only strength, the only Source of all that exists, the %0a%3c only One who can really help you, and He awaits your prayers for help. When %0a%3c you seek help in your search for freedom from the bondage of this world, help %0a%3c in elevating yourself above this world, help in finding the self, and help in %0a%3c determining your purpose in life, you must turn to the Creator, who sends you %0a%3c all those aspirations in order to compel you to turn to Him.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c Attaining the Worlds Beyond holds within it the content of that notebook, %0a%3c as well as other inspiring texts. This book reaches out to all those seekers who %0a%3c want to find a logical, reliable way to understand the world's phenomena. This %0a%3c fascinating introduction to the wisdom of Kabbalah will enlighten the mind, %0a%3c invigorate the heart, and move readers to the depths of their souls. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 512 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix One %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Basic Concepts in Kabbalah %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a book to help readers cultivate an approach to the concepts of Kabbalah, %0a%3c to spiritual objects, and to spiritual terms. By reading and re-reading in this %0a%3c book, one develops internal observations, senses, and approaches that did not %0a%3c previously exist within. These newly acquired observations are like sensors that %0a%3c "feel" the space around us that is hidden from our ordinary senses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, Basic Concepts in Kabbalah is intended to foster the contemplation %0a%3c of spiritual terms. Once we are integrated with these terms, we can begin to see, %0a%3c with our inner vision, the unveiling of the spiritual structure that surrounds us, %0a%3c almost as if a mist has been lifted. %0a%3c %0a%3c Again, this book is not aimed at the study of facts. Instead, it is a book for %0a%3c those who wish to awaken the deepest and subtlest sensations they can possess. %0a%3c %0a%3c Together Forever %0a%3c %0a%3c On the surface, Together Forever is a children's story. But like all good children's %0a%3c stories, it transcends boundaries of age, culture, and upbringing. %0a%3c %0a%3c In Together Forever, the author tells us that if we are patient and endure the %0a%3c trials we encounter along our life's path, we will become stronger, braver, and %0a%3c wiser. Instead of growing weaker, we will learn to create our own magic and our %0a%3c own wonders as only a magician can. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this warm, tender tale, Michael Laitman shares with children and %0a%3c parents alike some of the gems and charms of the spiritual world. The wisdom %0a%3c of Kabbalah is filled with spellbinding stories. Together Forever is yet another gift %0a%3c from this ageless source of wisdom, whose lessons make our lives richer, easier, %0a%3c and far more fulfilling. %0a%3c %0a%3c TEXTBOOKS %0a%3c Shamati %0a%3c %0a%3c Rav Michael Laitman's words on the book: Among all the texts and notes that %0a%3c were used by my teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), %0a%3c there was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained %0a%3c the transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi %0a%3c Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book %0a%3c of Zohar, The Study of the Ten Sefirot (a commentary on the texts of the Kabbalist, %0a%3c Ari), and of many other works on Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Further Reading %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 513 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Not feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash %0a%3c summoned me to his bedside and handed me a notebook, whose cover contained %0a%3c only one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said, "Take %0a%3c it and learn from it." The following morning, my teacher perished in my arms, %0a%3c leaving me and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Committed to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, %0a%3c I published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's %0a%3c transforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique %0a%3c and compelling creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix Two %0a%3c About Bnei Baruch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch is a group of Kabbalists in Israel, sharing the wisdom of %0a%3c Kabbalah with the entire world. Study materials in over 20 languages %0a%3c are based on authentic Kabbalah texts that were passed down from %0a%3c generation to generation. %0a%3c %0a%3c HISTORY AND ORIGIN %0a%3c %0a%3c In 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Rabbi Baruch Shalom HaLevi %0a%3c Ashlag (The Rabash), Rav Michael Laitman, Professor of Ontology and the %0a%3c Theory of Knowledge, PhD in Philosophy and Kabbalah, and MSc in Medical %0a%3c Bio-Cybernetics, established a Kabbalah study group called "Bnei Baruch." He %0a%3c called it Bnei Baruch (Sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his %0a%3c mentor, whose side he never left in the final twelve years of his life, from 1979 %0a%3c to 1991. Rav Laitman had been Ashlag's prime student and personal assistant, %0a%3c and is recognized as the successor to Rabash's teaching method. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rabash was the firstborn son and successor of Rabbi Yehuda Leib %0a%3c HaLevi Ashlag, the greatest Kabbalist of the 20 th century. Rabbi Ashlag authored %0a%3c the most authoritative and comprehensive commentary on The Book of Zohar, %0a%3c titled The Sulam Commentary (The Ladder Commentary). He was the first to reveal %0a%3c the complete method for spiritual ascent, and thus was known as Baal HaSulam %0a%3c (Owner of the Ladder). %0a%3c %0a%3c Today, Bnei Baruch bases its entire study method on the path paved by %0a%3c these two great spiritual leaders. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE STUDY METHOD %0a%3c %0a%3c The unique study method developed by Baal HaSulam and his son, the %0a%3c Rabash, is taught and applied on a daily basis by Bnei Baruch. This method %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 515 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 516 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Appendix Two %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c relies on authentic Kabbalah sources such as The Book of Zohar, by Rabbi %0a%3c Shimon Bar-Yochai, The Tree of Life, by the Holy Ari, and The Study of the Ten %0a%3c Sefirot, by Baal HaSulam. %0a%3c %0a%3c While the study relies on authentic Kabbalah sources, it is carried out in %0a%3c simple language and uses a scientific, contemporary approach. Developing this %0a%3c approach has made Bnei Baruch an internationally respected organization, both %0a%3c in Israel and in the world at large. %0a%3c %0a%3c The unique combination of an academic study method and personal %0a%3c experiences broadens the students' perspective and awards them a new %0a%3c perception of the reality they live in. Those on the spiritual path are thus given %0a%3c the necessary tools to research themselves and their surrounding reality. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE MESSAGE %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch is a diverse movement of many thousands of students worldwide. %0a%3c Students can choose their own paths and the personal intensity of their studies, %0a%3c according to their unique conditions and abilities. The essence of the message %0a%3c disseminated by Bnei Baruch is universal: unity of the people, unity of nations %0a%3c and love of man. %0a%3c %0a%3c For millennia, Kabbalists have been teaching that love of man should be the %0a%3c foundation of all human relations. This love prevailed in the days of Abraham, %0a%3c Moses, and the group of Kabbalists that they established. If we make room for %0a%3c these seasoned, yet contemporary values, we will discover that we possess the %0a%3c power to put differences aside and unite. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wisdom of Kabbalah, hidden for millennia, has been waiting for the time %0a%3c when we would be sufficiently developed and ready to implement its message. %0a%3c Now, it is emerging as a solution that can unite diverse factions everywhere, %0a%3c better enabling us, as individuals and as a society, to meet today's challenges. %0a%3c %0a%3c ACTIVITIES %0a%3c %0a%3c Bnei Baruch was established on the premise that "only by expansion of the %0a%3c wisdom of Kabbalah to the public can we be awarded complete redemption" %0a%3c (Baal HaSulam). %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, Bnei Baruch offers a variety of ways for people to explore and %0a%3c discover the purpose of their lives, providing careful guidance for the beginners %0a%3c and the advanced students alike. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c About Bnei Baruch %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 517 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah Today %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah Today is a free monthly paper produced and disseminated by Bnei Ba- %0a%3c ruch.
