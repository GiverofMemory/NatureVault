Some notes, introverted thinking in dominant position tends to outsource to extraverted thinking to double check their internal frameworks.  This might be looking up studies that may confirm or deny your thoery.  Introverted thinking is convergent whereas introverted feeling is divergent, perhaps if/why Ti and Fi are both high in intp's?  Ti fluid in intp but Fi is stubborn.  Fi is a dip function in an intp and as such must be voluntarily accessed.  Extraverted intuition possibilities counterbalnces the internal microscope of Si.  This microscope directed in a multitude of Ne directions validates the integrity of Ti frameworks.  Authority function (2nd slot) is divergent with Ne but operated underneath it is an equally divergent Ni that is used for prioritization of the ideas.  Si for close examination and refinement.  Ne gives abstract lens and Si a concrete lens.  Tends to fall into Ti-Ni state where they gather data and link them all together.  Fe can be strong to do things for others but can only be done in bursts.

Loyalty can be to a subject, a person, a group, an idea, a plan, a deadline, etc.%0a%0a#Avoiding the trap of self-righteousness by focusing on empathy instead.  This will turn your demon into a guardian angel.%0a%0a#Using helping others as motivation but not an end to itself.  You bieng your best self will help other incidentally, but you are generally not best at helping others directly.%0a%0a#Don't use Te (giving people advice) without using Ni which is learn every aspect of what you want to advise, don't shoot from the hip.  Or you can also use Si which would mean you can give advice by comparing a current situation to one you have seen before.  Also qualify your advice with as much downplaying of your own merits as possible (ie: i'm not a doctor and I don't know all the possible downsides of this suggestion [so do your own research] but you might want to look into X because I think it might really help you with Y because it does Z).  INTP is not generally good at giving advice, just teaching others so they can make good decisions on their own.  This is why INTP's generally do not want to make rules for others to follow.%0a%0a!!INFP%0a%0aFi vs Fe means they internalize thought before externalizing action.  Access Ti and Ni through gateway of Fi which leads to a more attached to themselves form of logic rather than detached logic and researching.  Fi is more convergent and fluid and malleable sense of self as opposed to the more rigid values of the intp.  Se is opposite of Ne and so is a blindspot just like intps.  Uses extraverted intuition funneled through Si to sort of compensate for a lack of Se, intp's do the same. INFP's and ESFJ are best types in lab environment where logical frameworks are to be observed and abided by and are divergent thinkers and have a preference for resaerch over conjecture [[https://youtu.be/u4l4mIeDfBg?t=659|#]] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4l4mIeDfBg&list=TLPQMDgwODIwMjJZdD3zEPaV1g&index=2|#]] youtube:5 signs you're not an infp.%0a%0a!!ISTJ%0a%0aThey tend to want to know whats going on and what people plan to do around them.  They want to get a sense of the details of everything going on around them [[https://funkymbti.com/2020/07/04/turn-washingtons-spies-general-george-washington-istj/|#]].  They tend to stray from what is "need to know" and when unhealthy can pry into other things they don't need to know just because they are curious [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/istj-conversation-manipulation.8322/|#]], which people don't like.  They just want to know, and also sometimes they see a pathway to use this information against the person to manipulate them or make them fit in a box they have for them. ISTJ's tend to want to box things in because they are uncomfortable with unpredictable things.  This can be prematurely or unnecessarily asking you a question which makes you feel like you must make a decision then, where taking your time to think about it before a decision could have led to a better decision.  This tends to happen when the type feels they are boring or nerdy and must become more extraverted, this can be seen by them as "coming out of their shell". This can cause a switch to flip inside them and they use Te in a dominant way even though they are not the best at using it wisely.  Also they can be overconfident in Ne and have crazy ideas that are not grounded in reality which informs their questioning.  Speculation is a good word for this.  They over-use Ne in order to seem interesting and edgy, and not nerdy or a dork.%0a%0aTe, if overused by a non Te dominant, can be controlling [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OEjwYuIN48|#]]%0a%0aThey also tend to have a method of the way they want things done [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/manipulative-istjs-is-it-possible.64733/|#]] and can become irritated with small things that don't line up with their methodology like placing something on a certain part of the counter instead of another part.%0a%0aFunny sketches [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiIlB2Pbcvc&list=TLPQMDkwODIwMjKLQMGxu8Imnw&index=11|#]]%0a%0aThey are perfect which makes them weird, from an INFJ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBqLnttwCE|#]]%0a%0awhy ISTJ's are great by psyc and chill with michi [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUQdZ4I__uk|#]]%0a%0a!!!Goodside%0a%0aThey tend to be very loyal and committed and generous to those they believe are good people.%0a%0a!!!Darkside%0aManipulative but direct line of questioning to get you to reveal something that you normally wouldn't [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/manipulative-istjs-is-it-possible.64733/|#]] [[https://www.typologycentral.com/threads/istj-conversation-manipulation.8322/|#]].
