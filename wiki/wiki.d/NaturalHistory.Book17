(1.) — TEEES AVHICn HAVE BEEX SOLD AT ENOHMOUS %0aPRICES. %0a%0aWe have described the trees which grow spontaneously on %0aland and in the sea,^ and it now remains for us to speak of %0athose which owe their formation, properly speaking, rather than %0abirth, to art and the inventive genius of man.* Here, how- %0aever, I cannot but express my surprise, that after the state of %0apenury in which man lived, as already described,^ in primitive %0atimes, holding the trees of the forest in common with the wUd %0abeasts, and disputing with them the possession of the fruits %0athat fell, and with the fowls of the air that of the fruits as they %0ahung on the tree, luxury has now attached to them prices so %0aenormous. %0a%0aThe most famous instance, in my opinion, of this excess, was %0athat displayed by L. Crassus and Cneius Domitius Aheno- %0abarbus. Crassus was one of the most celebrated of the Eoman %0aorators ; his house was remarkable for its magnificence, though %0ain some measure surpassed even by that of Q. Catulus,* %0aalso upon the Palatine Hill ; the same Catulus, who, in con- %0ajimction with C. Marius, defeated the Cimbri. But by far %0athe finest house of all that period, it was universally acknow- %0aledged, was that of C. Aquilius, a Roman of Equestrian rank, %0asituate upon the Viminal Hill ; a house, indeed, that conferred %0aa greater degree of celebrity upon him than even his acquaint- %0aance with the civil law. This, however, did not prevent %0aCrassus being reproached with the magnificence of his. Cras- %0asus and Domitius, members, both of them, of the most illus- %0a%0a1 He alludes to the various shrubs and trees, mentioned as growing in %0athe sea, B. xiii. c. 48 ; but which there is little doubt, in reality belong to %0athe class of fuci. %0a%0a2 "Fiunt verius quam nascuntur;" a distinction perpetuated in the %0aadage, " Poeta nascitur, non fit." %0a%0a3 He probably alludes to his remark in B. xvi. c. 1. %0a%0a* Q. Luctutius Catulus, the colleague of Marius. Being afterwards con- %0ademned to die by Marius, he suffocated himself with the fumes of charcoal. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 1 .] %0a%0a%0a%0aTREES SOLD AT ENOEMOUS PEICES. %0a%0a%0a%0a439 %0a%0a%0a%0atnous families, after holding the consulship,' were appointed %0aJ^T ^^"so^sl^iP. the year from the buUding of the %0a%0aCity 662, a period of office that was fruitful iu strife, the %0anatural result of their dissimilarity of character. On one oc- %0acasion, Cneuis Domitius, naturally a man of hasty temper, and %0ainflamed besides by a hatred that rivalry only tends to stimu- %0alate, gravely rebuked Crassus for living, and he a Censor too, %0ain a style ot such magniHccnco, and in a house for which, as %0ahe said, he himself would be ready to pay down ten millions %0aof sesterces. Crassus, a man who united to singular presence %0aof mind great readiness of wit, made answer that, deducting %0asix trees only, he would accept the offer; upon \vhieh Domi- %0atius replied, that upon those terms he would not give so much %0aas a single denarius for the purchase. " Well then, Domi- %0atius," was the rejoinder of Crassus, " which of the two is it %0athat sets a bad example, and deserves the reproof of the cen- %0asorship ; I, who live like a plain man in a house that has %0acome to me by inheritance, or you, who estimate six trees %0aat a value of ten millions of sesterces ?" ^ These trees were %0aof the lotus' kind, and by the exuberance of their branches %0aafforded a most delightful shade. Cajcina Largus, one of the %0agrandees of Home, and the owner of the house, used often to %0apoint them out to me in my younger days ; and, as I have al- %0aready made mention* of the remarkable longevity of trees, I %0awould here add, that they were in existence down to the pe- %0ariod when the Emperor Nero set fire to the City, one hundred %0aand eighty years after the time of Crassus ; being still green %0aand with all tlie freshness of youth upon them, had not that %0aprince thought fit to hasten the death of the very trees even. %0a%0aLet no one, however, imagine that the house of Crassus was %0aof no value in other respects, or that, from the rebuke of Domi- %0atius, there was nothing about it worthy cf remark with the %0aexception of these trees. There were to be seen erected in the %0aatrium four columns of marble from Mount Hymettus,* which %0ain his jBdileship he had ordered to be brought over for the de- %0acoration of the stage f and this at a time, too, when no public %0a%0a* A.u.c. 659. %0a%0a* Valerius Maximus.

[Book XVI [. %0a%0a%0a%0abuildings even as yet possessed any pillars made of that mate- %0arial. Of such recent date is the luxury and opulence which %0aAve now enjoy, and so much greater was the value which in %0athose days trees were supposed to confer upon a property ! %0aA pretty good proof of which, was the fact th:it Doniitius even, %0awith all his enmity, would not keep to the offer he had made, %0aif the trees were not to be included in the bargain. %0a%0aThe trees have furnished surnames also to the ancients,'" such, %0afor instance, as that of Fronditius to the warrior who swam %0aacross the Volturnus with a wreath of leaves on his head, and %0adistinguished himself by his famous exploits in the war against %0aHannibal ; and that of Stolo^^ to the Licinian family, such being %0athe name given by us to the useless suckers that shoot from %0atrees ; the best method of clearing away these shoots was %0adiscovered by the first Stolo, and hence his name. The ancient %0alaws also took the trees under their protection ; and by the %0aTwelve Tables it was enacted, that he who should wrongfully %0acut down trees belonging to another person, should pay twenty- %0afive asses for each. Is it possible then to imagine that they, %0awho estimated the fruit-trees at so low a rate as this, could ever %0ahave supposed that so exorbitant a value would be put upon the %0alotus as that which I have just mentioned ? And no less mar- %0avellous, too, are the changes that have taken place in the value %0aof fruit ; for at the present day we fi.nd the fruit alone of many %0aof the trees in the suburbs valued at no less a sum than two %0athousand sesterces ; the profits derived from a single tree thus %0abeing more tlian those of a whole estate in former times. It %0awas from motives of gain that the grafting of trees and the %0apropagation thereby of a spurious ofispring was first devised, %0aso that the growth of the fruits even might be a thing inter- %0adicted to the poor. We shall, therefore, now proceed to %0astate in what way it is that such vast revenues are derived %0afrom these trees, and with that object shall set forth the true %0aand most approved methods of cultivation ; not taking any %0anotice of the more common methods, or those which we find %0agenerally adopted, but considering only those points of doubt %0aand uncertainty, in relation to which practical men are most %0aapt to find themselves at a loss : while, at the same time, to %0a%0aAs Fee remarks, this usage has been reversed in modern times, and %0aplants often receive their botanical names from men. %0a1' See B. xviii. c. 4. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] THE INFLUENCE OF WEATUEE ON THEES. %0a%0a%0a%0aaffect any scrupulous exactness in cases where there is no %0anecessity tor it, will be no part of our purpose. In the first %0aplace, however, we will consider in a general point of view %0athose inlluences of soil as well as weather which are exercised %0aupon all the trees in common. %0a%0aCHAP. 2. (2.) THE INFLUENCE OP WEATHEK UPON THE TKICES : %0a%0aWHAT IS THE PROPER SITUATION FOR THE VINE. %0a%0aTrees are fond of a site more particularly that faces the %0anorth-east the breezes rendering their foliage more thick and %0aexuberant, and imparting additional solidity to the wood. This %0ais a point, however, upon which most people are very greatly %0adeceived ; thus in vineyards, for instance, the props ought not %0ato be placed in such a position as to shelter the stems from the %0awind in that quarter, it being only against the northern blasts %0athat this precaution should be taken. Nay, even more than this %0a— if the cold weather only comes on in due season, it contributes %0avery materiallj^ to the strengthening of the trees, and promotes %0athe process of germination ; while, on the other hand, if at that %0aperiod the southern breezes should caress them, they will grow %0aweak and languid, and more i)articularly so, if the blossom is %0ajust coming on. If rainy weather, too, should happen to %0afollow close upon blossoming, the total destruction of the fruit %0ais the necessary result : indeed, if the weather should be only %0acloudy, or south winds happen to prevail, it is quite sufficient %0ato ensure the loss of the fruit in the almond and the pear.'* %0aRains, if prevalent about the rising of the Vergiliae,"' are most %0ainjurious to the vine and the olive, as it is at that season that %0agermination*' is commencing with them ; indeed, this is a most %0a%0a'2 Or north north-east, as Fee says. He adds that this aspect in re- %0aality is not favourable to vegetation. Pliny commits the error of copying %0aexactly from Theophrastus, and thereby giving advice to Roman agricul- %0aturists, which was properly suited to the clinnite of Greece only. %0a%0a'3 This is borrowed from Theophrastus ; but, as Fee remarks, if suitable %0ato the climate of Greece, it is not so to that of Italy or France, where %0avegetation is much more promoted by a south wind. %0a%0a11 This assertion, Fee says, is erroneous. See B. xvi. c. 46. %0a%0aB. xviii. 0. 66. . ■ , • j i i ^ %0a%0aSee c 30 of this Book. These notions as to critical periods to plants %0aconnected "with the constellations, Fee says, are now almost dispelled ; %0athough they still prevail in France, to some extent. %0a1' " Coitus." See B. xvi. cc. 39 and 42. %0a%0a%0a%0a442 %0a%0a%0a%0aPliny's natueal nisTOET. [Book XVII. %0a%0a%0a%0acritical four days for the olive, being the period at which the %0asouth wind, as we have already'* stated, brings on its dark and %0alowering clouds. The cereals, too, ripen more unfavourably %0awhen south winds prevail, though at the same time it pro- %0aceeds with greater rapidity. All cold, too, is injurious to ve- %0agetation, which comes with the northern winds, or out of the %0aproper season. It is most advantageous to all plants for %0anorth-east winds" to prevail throughout the Avinter. %0a%0aIn this season, too, showers are very necessary, and the rea- %0ason is self-evident — the trees, being exhausted by the fruit %0athey have borne, and weakened by the loss of their leaves, are, %0aof course, famished and hungry; and it is the showers that %0aconstitute their aliment. Experience has led us to believe %0athat there is nothing more detrimental than a warm winter ; %0afor it allows the trees, the moment they have parted with %0atheir fruits, to conceive again, or, in other words, to germinate, %0aand then exhaust themselves by blossoming afresh. And %0awhat is even worse than this, should there be several years of %0asuch weather in succession, even the trees themselves will die ; %0afor there can be little doubt that the effort must of necessity %0abe injurious, when they put forth their strength, and are at %0athe same time deprived of their natural sustenance. The poet^" %0athen, who has said that serene winters are to be desired, cer- %0atainly did not express those wishes in favour of the trees. %0aAnd no more docs rain, if prevalent at the summer-solstice, %0aconduce to the benefit^' of the vine : while, at the same time, %0ato say that a dusty winter produces a luxuriant harvest, is cer- %0atainly the mistake of a too fertile imagination. It is a thing %0agreatly to be wished, too, both in behalf of the trees as well as %0athe cereals, that the snows should lie for a considerable time %0aupon the ground ; the reason being that they check the escape %0aof the spirit of the earth by evaporation, and tend to throw it %0a%0a'8 See B. xvi. c. 46. %0a%0a" From Theophrastus, De Cansis, B. ii. c. 1. %0a%0a"^^ He alludes to the words of Virgil, Georg. i. 100 : — %0a%0a"Huraida solstitia, atque liienies orate serenas, %0aAgricolae; hibemo laetissima pulvere farra." %0aFee remarks, that the cultivators of the modern times are more of the %0aopinion of the poet tlian the naturalist. %0a%0aBecause rains would cause the young fruit to fall off. He here %0aattacks the first portion of the precepts of Virgil ; but only, it appears, in %0areference to the vine %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] THE INFLTTENCE OF WEATUEE ON TEEE3. 443 %0a%0aback agaiu upon the roots of the plants, addin- {rreatlv to %0atheir strength thereby; and not only this, but they affofd a %0agradual supi)ly of moisture as well, that is both pure and of %0aremarkable lightness, from the fact that snow is only the %0afoam of the waters of heaven. Hence it is that the moisture %0aof snow does not drench and engulph everj-thing all at once, %0abut gradually trickles downwards, in proportion to the thirst of %0athe plant, nurturing it as though from the breast, instead of %0aproducing an inundation. The earth, too, ferments under this %0ainfluence, and becomes filled with her own emanations : not %0aexhausted by the seeds in her bosom, swollen as they are with %0amilk,"-' she smiles in the warm and balmy hours, when the time %0acomes for opening it. It is in this way, more particularly, %0athat com fattens apace, except, indeed, in those climates in %0awhich the atmosphere is always warm, Egypt for example ; for %0athere the continuance of the same temperature and the force of %0ahabit are productive of the same effects as the modifications of %0atemperature in other countries. %0a%0aAt the same time it is equally necessary in every climate %0athat there should be no noxious influence in existence. Thus, %0afor instance, in the greater part of the world, that precocious %0agermination which has been encouraged by the indulgent tempe- %0arature of the weather, is sure to be nipped by the intense colds %0athat ensue. Hence it is that late winters are so injurious, %0aand such they prove to the trees of the forest even ; indeed, %0athese last are more particularly exposed to the ill effects of a %0alate winter, oppressed as they are by the density of their %0afoliage, and human agency being unable to succour them ; for %0ait would be quite impossible to cover^^ the more tender forest %0atrees with wisps of straw. Eains, then, are favourable to %0avegetation — first of all, during the winter season, and next, %0ajust previously to germination ; the third period for them being %0athat of the formation of the fruit, though not immediately, %0aand only, in fact, when the produce of the tree shows itself %0astrong and healthy. %0a%0a" " Lactescentibus." Fee remarks on the appropriateness of this expres- %0asion, as the act of germination, he says, in the cereals and all the seeds in %0awhich the perisperm is feculent, changes the fecula into an emulsive %0aliquid, in which state the seed may be said, with Pliny, to be %0a"lactescent." %0a%0aWhich appears to have been extensively done with the young garden %0a%0atrees. %0a%0a%0a%0a441 %0a%0a%0a%0aPliny's natural uistouy. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aThose trees which are the slo-n'est in bringing their fruits to %0amaturity, and require a more prolonged supply of nutriment, %0areceive benefit also from late rains, such as the vino, the olive, %0aand the pomegranate, for instance. These rains, however, ai-e %0arequired at different seasons by the different trees, some of %0athem coming to maturity at one period and some at another ; %0ahence it is that we see the very same rain productive of injury %0ato some trees and beneficial to others, even when they are of the %0avery same species, as in the pear for instance : for the winter %0apear stands in need of rain at one period, and the early pear at %0aanother, though at the same time they, all of them, require it %0ain an equal degree. "Winter precedes the period of germina- %0ation, and it is this fact that makes the north-east wind more %0abeneficial than the south, and renders the parts that lie in the %0ainterior preferable to those near the coast, — the former being %0agenerally the coldest, — mountainous districts better than level %0aones, and rain at night better than showers in the day. Vege- %0atation, too, receives a greater degree of benefit from the water %0aAvhen the sun. does not immediately soak it up. %0a%0aConnected, too, with this subject is the question of the best %0asituation for planting vines, and the trees which support them. %0aVirgiP* condemns a western aspect, while there are some persons, %0aagain, who prefer it to an easterly one : I find, however, that %0amost authors approve of the south, though I do not think that %0aany abstract precepts-^ can be given in relation to the point. %0aThe most careful attention on the part of the cultivator ought %0ato be paid to the nature of the soil, the character of the loca- %0ality, and the respective influences of climate. The method ot %0agiving to the vine a southern aspect, as practised in Africa and %0a* * * jg injurious to the tree, as well as unhealthy for %0athe cultivator, from the very circumstance that tlie country %0aitself lies under a southern meridian : hence it is, that he who %0aselects for his plants tliere a western or a northerly aspect, will %0acombine on the most advantageous terms the benefits of soil %0awith those of climate. When Yirgil condemns a western aspect, %0athere can be no doubt that he includes in his censure a northern %0aaspect as well : and yet, in Cisalpine Italy, where most of the %0avineyards have an aspect to the north, it lias been foirnd by %0aexperience that there are none that are more prolific. %0a%0aGeorg. ii. 398. %0a%0a25 Taken altogether, a southern aspect is preferable to all othcis. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 2.] IIIK INiTLUKNCE OF WEATHER OX TliEES. 445 %0a%0aThe winds are also a very important consideration. In the %0aprovinces of Gallia Narbonensis, and in Liguria and part of %0aEtruna, it is considered a proof of great want of skill to plant %0athe vine on a site that lies in the teeth of the wind Circius ^ %0awhile, on the other hand, it is a mark of prudence to catch %0aIts breezes in an oblique direction ; it is this wind, in fact, %0athat modihes the heat in those countries, though at the same %0atime it is usually so violent, as to sweep away the roofs of %0athe houses. %0a%0a(3.) There are some persons who employ a method of making %0athe question of weather dependent upon the nature of the soil ; %0athus in the case of a vineyard, for instance, in a dry locality, %0athey give it an eastern or a northern aspect ; but where it "is %0aplanted on a humid site, it is made to face the south. From %0athe varieties of the vine also, they borrow various modifica- %0ations in reference to site ; taking care to plant the early vine %0ain a cold locality, in order that the fruit may ripen before the %0afrosts come on ; while such fruit trees and vines as have an anti- %0apathy to dews are exposed to the east, that the sun may carry %0aoff their humidity at the earliest moment. On the other hand, %0asuch as manifest a partiality to dews are planted with a western %0aor even a northern aspect, to give them an opportunity of en- %0ajoying them all the longer. Others, again, borrowing their %0anotions pretty nearly from Nature, have recommended that %0avines and trees should be planted facing the north-east ; indeed %0aDcmocritus is of opinion, that by so doing the fruit will %0abe all the more odoriferous. %0a%0a(4.) We have already spoken, in the Second Book,^' of the %0apoints of the north-east and other winds, and shall have occa- %0asion in the succeeding one to make mention of several more of %0athe heavenly pha^nomena. In the mean time, however, we %0aDiay observe that it would appear to be a manifest proof of the %0asalubrity of a north-east site, that the leaves are always the %0afirst to tall in the trees that have an aspect toAvards the south.-* %0aA similar reason exists, too, in the maritime districts; in %0acertain localities the sea breezes are detrimental, though in %0amost they are nutritious. For some plants, again, it is pleasant %0ato behold the sea at a distance, while at the same time they %0a%0a26 See B. ii. c. 46. Cc. 46 and 47. %0a%0a2» He seums to lose sight of the fact that they bud before those that look %0ato the north. %0a%0a%0a%0a446 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLTNy's NATDRAIi niSTOET. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVI T. %0a%0a%0a%0awill gain nothing by approaching closer to its saline exhala- %0ations. The same, too, is the influence exercised by rivers and %0alakes ; they will either scorch the vegetation by the fogs they %0aemit, or else modify by their coolness the excess of heat. We %0ahave already mentioned-^ the plants that thrive in the shade, %0aand in the cold even ; but in all these matters experience will %0abe found the best of guides. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. WHAT SOILS AKE TO BE CONSIDEEED THE BEST. %0a%0aNext after the influences of the heavens, we have to treat of %0athose of the earth, a task that is in no way more easy than the %0aprevious one. It is but rarely that the same soil is found %0asuited to trees as well as corn : indeed, the black ^° earth which %0aprevails in Campania is not everywhere found suited to the vine, %0anor yet that which emits light exhalations, or the red^' soil %0athat has been so highly praised by many. The cretaceous earth %0athat is found in the territory of Alba Pompeia, and an argil- %0alaceous soil, are preferred to all others for the vine, although, %0atoo, they are remarkably rich, a quality that is generally looked %0aupon as not suited to that plant. On the other hand, again, %0athe white sand of the district of Ticinura, the black saud of %0amany other places, and the red sand as Avell, even though mixed %0awith a rich earth, will prove unproductive. %0a%0aThe very signs, also, from which we form our judgment are %0aoften very deceptive ; a soil that is adorned with tall and %0agraceful trees is not always a favourable one, except, of course, %0afor those trees. What tree, in fact, is there that is taller than %0athe fir ? and yet what other plant could possibly exist in the %0asame spot ? Nor ought we always to look upon verdant pas- %0atures as so many proofs of richness of soil ; for what is there %0athat enjoys a greater renown than the pastures of Germany? %0aand yet they consist of nothing but a very thin layer of turf, %0awith sand immediately beneath. Nor yet is the soil which %0aproduces herbage of large growth always to be looked upon as %0aliumid; no, by Hercules ! no more than a soil is to be looked %0aupon as unctuous and rich, which adheres to the fingers — a %0a%0a29 B. xvi. cc. 30, 31. %0a%0a30 A rich black mould, probably. %0aA ferruginous argilla. %0a%0a32 It must of necussity denote a soil ricli in humus, tbougli not, of %0acourse, adapted for all kiuds of cultivation. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0a■WnAT SOILS AKE BEST. %0a%0a%0a%0a447 %0a%0a%0a%0athipg that IS proved m the case of the argillaceous earths.^ %0aThe earth who'd thrown back into the hole from which it has %0ajust been dug will never=^ fill it, so that it is quite impossible %0aby that method to form any opinion as to its density or thin- %0aness. It IS the fact, too, that every ^* soil, without exception, %0awill cover iron with rust. Nor yet can we determine^* the %0aheaviness or lightness of soils in relation to any fixed and as- %0acertained weight: for what are we to understand as the %0astandard weight of earth ? A soil, too, that is formed from %0athe alluvion of rivers is not always to be recommended, for %0athere are some crops that decay all the sooner in a watery soil ; %0aindeed, those soils even of this description which are highly %0aesteemed, are never found to be long good for any kind of %0avegetation but the willow. %0a%0aAmong other proofs of the goodness of soil, is the comparative %0athickness of the stem in corn. In Laborium, a famous cham- %0apaign country of Campania, the stalk is of such remarkable %0athickness, that it may be used even to supply the place of %0awood and yet this very soil, from the difficulty that is every- %0awhere experienced in cultivating it, and the labour required %0ain working it, may be almost said to give the husbandman %0amore trouble by its good qualities than it could possibly have %0adone by reason of any defects. The soil, too, that is generally %0aknown as charcoal earth, appears susceptible of being im- %0aproved by being planted with a poor meagre vine : and tufa, ' %0a%0aHe alludes to the difficulty with which argilla, from its tenacity, is %0aemployed in cultivation. %0a%0a^' Columella says the contrary, and so does Virgil, Georg. ii. 226, %0aspeaking of this fact as a method of ascertaining the respective quaUties of %0athe earth. %0a%0a^ Virgil, Georg. ii. 220, says the contrary. %0a%0a^ In allusion to what Virgil says, Georg. ii. 254 : — %0a%0a"Quae gravis est, ipso tacitamse pondere prodit, %0a%0aQuffique levis " %0a%0aFee remarks, however, that it is easy enough to analyse the earth, and %0aascertain the proportions of humus, and of the siliceous, cretaceous, or %0aargillaceous earths ; the relative proportions of which render it strong or %0alight, as the case may be. %0a%0a^' As Fee says, these earths vary according to the nature of the soils %0athat are bronglit down by the streams; in general, however, they are e.t- %0atremely prolific. %0a%0aFee says that Pliny is Iiere guilty of some degree of exaggeration. %0aSee B. iii. c. 9, p. 195 of Vol. 1 : also B. xviii. c. 29. _ %0a'^'■> " Tophus ;" formed of volcanic scoriae.

Virgil/" too, does not condemn for the vine %0aa soil which produces fern -while a salted earth" is thought %0ato be much better entrusted with the growth of vj-getation than %0aanj'' other, from the fact of its being comparatively safe from %0anoxious insects breeding there. Declivities, too, are far from %0aunproductive, if a person only knows how to dig them pro- %0aperly ; and it is not all " champaign spots that are less acces- %0asible to the sun and wind than is necessary for their benefit. %0aWe have already" alluded to the fact, that there are certain %0avines which find nutriment in hoar frosts and fogs. %0a%0aIn every subject there are certain deep and recondite %0asecrets, which it is left to the intelligence of each to penetrate. %0aDo we not, for instance, find it the fact, that soils which have %0along offered opportunities for a sound judgment being formed on %0atheir qualities have become totally altered ? In the vicinity %0aof Larissa, in Thessaly, a lake was drained and the conse- %0aquence was, that the district became much colder, and the %0aolive-trees which had formerly borne fruit now ceased to bear. %0aWhen a channel was cut for the Hebrus, near the town of %0a^nos, the place was sensible of its nearer approach, in finding %0aits vines frost-bitten, a thing that had never happened before ; %0ain the vicinity, too, of Philippi, the country having been %0adrained for cultivation, the nature of the climate became en- %0atirely altered. In the territory of Syracuse, a husbandman, %0awho was a stranger to the place, cleared the soil of all the %0astones, and the consequence was, that he lost his crops from %0athe accumulation of mud ; so that at last he was obliged to %0acarry the stones back again. In Syria again, the plough- %0a%0a•wliat similar in nature to marl, and that though unproductive by itself, it %0ais beneficial when mixed with vegetable earth.

At Chalcia,*" an %0aisland belonging to the Ehodians, there is a certain place which %0ais so remarkably fertile, that after reaping the barley that has %0abeen sown at the ordinary time, and gathering it in, they im- %0amediately sow a fresh crop, and reap it at the same time as the %0aother corn. A gravelly soil is found best suited for the olive %0ain the district of Yenafrum," while one of extreme richness is %0arequired for it in Baetica. The wines of Tucinum^* are ri- %0apened upon a rock, and the vines of Cajcubum''^ are moistened %0aby the waters of the Pomptine*" marshes ; so great are the dif- %0aferences that have been detected by human experience in the %0avarious soils. Ca3sar Vopiscus, when pleading a cause before %0athe Censors, said that the fields of Rosia*' are the very marrow" %0aof Italy, and that a stake, left in the ground there one day, %0awould be found covered by the grass the next : °^ the soil, liow- %0aever, is only esteemed there for the purposes of pasturage.

If it is the wish of a person to test whether a soil is %0abitter, or Avhether it is thin and meagre, the fact may be easily %0aascertained from the presence of black and undergrown herbs. %0aIf, again, the herbage shoots up dry and stunted, it shows that %0athe soil is cold, and if sad and languid, that it is moist and %0aslimy.

So, too, on the other hand, the eye can distinguish a %0asoil that is mixed with ashes or with white sand, Avhile earth %0athat is sterile and dense may be easily detected by its peculiar %0ahardness, at even a single stroke of the mattock. %0a%0aCato,^* briefly and in his peculiar manner, characterizes the %0adefects that exist in the various soils. " Take care," he says, %0a" where the earth is rotten not to shake it either with carts or %0aby driving cattle over it." Now what are we to suppose that %0athis term " rotten" means, as applied to a soil, about which %0ahe is so vastly apprehensive as to almost forbid our setting %0afoot upon it ? Let us only form a comparison by thinking %0awhat it is that constitutes rottenness in wood, and we shall %0afind that the faults which are held by him in such aversion are %0athe being arid, full of holes, rough, white, mouldy, worm- %0aeaten, in fact, just like pumice-stone ; and thus has Cato said %0amore in a single word than we could have possibly found %0ameans to express in a description, however long. Indeed, if %0awe could find means of expressing the various defects that %0aexist in soils, we should find that there are some of them that %0aare old, not with age (for age cannot'^ be concerned in relation %0ato the earth), but of their own nature, and are hence unfruit- %0aful and powerless for every purpose from the first. The same %0awriter, too, considers that as the very best of soils, which, %0asituate at the foot of a declivity, runs out into a champaign %0acountry, taking a southward direction ; -such, in fact, being %0athe aspect of the whole of Italy he says** also, that the earth %0agenerally known as black earth is of a tender nature, and %0ais consequently the most easily worked and the best for cereals. %0aIf we only appreciate with due care the signification of this %0aword "tender,"^" we shall find that it expresses its intended %0ameaning remarkably well, and that in this word is comprised %0aevery quality that is desirable for the purposes of cultivation. %0a%0a51 De Re Rust. 5. %0a%0a55 This he says in reference to his belief, with Epicurus, in the eternity %0aof matter. %0a%0a^ De Re Rust. 1.

Earth %0aof this nature will shine again after the plough-share has %0apassed through it, just as Homer," that great fountain-head of %0aall genius, has described it sculptured by the Divinity^^ upon %0athe arms [of Achilles], adding, too, a thing that is truly marvel- %0alous, that It was of a blackish hue, though gold was the mate- %0arial in which it was wrought. This, too, is that kind of earth, %0awhich, when newly turned up, attracts the ravenous birds that %0afollow the plough-share, the ravens even going so far as to peck %0aat the heels of the ploughman. %0a%0aWe may in this place appropriately make mention of an %0aopinion that has been pronounced by an Italian writer also %0awith reference to a matter of luxury. Cicero, that other %0aluminary of literature, has made the following remark : " Those %0aunguents which have a taste of earth" are better," says he, %0a"than those which smack of saffron;" it seeming to him %0amore to the purpose to express himself by the word " taste"''* %0athan "smell." And such is the fact, no doubt; that soil %0ais the best which has the flavour of a perfume."^ If the %0aquestion should be put to us, what is this odour of the earth %0athat is held in such estimation, our answer is, that it is the %0asame that is often to be recognized at the moment of sunset, %0awithout the necessity even of turning up the ground, at the %0aspots where the extremities of the rainbow" have been ob- %0aserved to meet the earth ; as also when, after long-continuecl %0adrought, the rain has soaked the ground. Then it is that the %0aearth exhales this di^-ine odour, that is so peculiarly its own, %0aand to which, imparted to it by the sun, there is no perfume, %0ahowever sweet, that can possibly be compared. It is this %0aodour that the earth, when turned up, ought to emit, and %0awhich, when once found, can never deceive a person ; and %0athis will be found the best criterion for judging of the quality %0aof the soil. Such, too, is the odour that is usually perceived %0a%0a".Iliad, xviii. 541 and 548. %0a%0a02 Vulcan.

In other %0akinds of soil the work of cultivation depends entirely upon the %0aweather ; as, for instance, in those which cannot be ploughed %0ajust after rain, because the natui'al exuberance of the earth %0arenders it viscous and cloggy. On the other hand, in Byza- %0acium, a district of Africa, and a champaign country of such %0asingular fertility as to render grain one hundred and fifty fold," %0athe soil is such, that in time of drought, not even bulls are %0aable to plough it; while, on another occasion, just after a shower %0aof rain, one poor ass, with an old woman to guide it, is quite %0asufficient," as ourselves we have witnessed, to do the plough- %0aing. But as to amending one soil by the agency of another, %0aas some persons recommend, by throwing rich earth over one %0athat is poor and thin, or by laying a soaking light soil over %0aone that is humid and unctuous, it is a labour of perfect %0amadness."

It has also one of these two peculiar- %0aities, it is either rough or greasy to the touch ; the proper %0amode of testing it being by the hand. Its uses, too, are of a %0atwofold nature — it is employed for the production of the %0acereals only, or else for the enrichment of pasture land as %0awell. The tufaceous"^ kind is nutrimental to grain, and so %0ais the white ; if found in the vicinity of springs, it is fertile %0ato an immeasurable extent ; but if it is rough to the touch, %0awhen laid upon the land in too large a quantity, it is apt to %0aburn up the soil.

These stones are broken upon the land itself, and it is %0a%0awith considerable dilficulty during the earlier years that the %0astalk of the corn is cut, in consequence of the presence of these %0astones ; however, as it is remarkably light, it only costs for %0acarriage one-half of the outlay required in using the other %0avarieties. It is laid but very thinly on the surface, and it is %0agenerally thought that it is mixed with salt. Both of these %0avarieties, when once laid on the land, will fertilize it for %0afifty'' years, whether for grain or for hay. %0a%0a(8.) Of the marls that are found to be of an unctuous na- %0ature, the best is the white. There are several varieties of it : %0athe most pungent and biting being the one already mentioned. %0aAnother kind is the white chalk that is used for cleaning %0asilver ; it is taken from a considerable depth in the ground, %0athe pits being sunk, in most instances, as much as one hundred %0afeet. These pits are narrow at the mouth, but the shafts en- %0alarge very considerably in the interior, as is the case in mines; %0ait is in Britain more particularly that this chalk is employed. %0aThe good efiects of it are found to last fall eighty years ; and %0athere is no instance known of an agriculturist laying it twice %0aon the same land during his life.*' A third variety of white %0amarl is known as glisomarga f- it consists of fullers' chalk ^ %0amixed with an unctuous earth, and is better for promoting the %0agrowth of hay than grain ; so much so, in fact, that between %0aharvest and the ensuing seed-time there is cut a most abundant %0acrop of grass.

The ^dui and the Pictones have rendered %0atheir lands remarkably fertile by the aid of limestone, which %0ais also found to be particularly beneficial to the olive and the %0avine.*' Every marl, however, requires to be laid on the land %0aimmediately after ploughing, in order that the soil may at %0aonce imbibe its properties ; while at the same time, it requires %0aa little manure as well, as it is apt, at first, to be of too acrid %0aK nature, at least where it is not pasture land that it is laid %0aupon; in addition to which, by its very freshness it may pos- %0asibly injure the soil, whatever the nature of it may be; so %0amuch so, indeed, that the land is never fertile the first year %0aafter it has been employed. It is a matter of consideration %0aalso for what kind of soil the marl is required ; if the soil is %0amoist, a dry marl is best suited for it ; and if dry, a rich %0aunctuous marl. If, on the other hand, the land is of a medium %0aquality, chalk or columbine^* marl is the best suited for it. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. (9.)

[Book XVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aPadus, are such admirers of ashes'"' for this purpose, that thoy %0aeven prefer it as a manure to the dung of beasts of burden; %0aindeed, they are in the habit of burning dung for this pur- %0apose, on account of its superior lightness. They do not, how- %0aever, use them indiscriminately upon the same soil, nor do %0athey employ ashes for promoting the growth of shrubs, nor, in %0afact, of some of the cereals, as we shall have occasion'" to %0amention hereafter. There are some persons who are of opinion %0aalso that dust'^ imparts nutriment to grapes, and cover tliem %0awith it while they are growing, taking care to throw it also %0aupon the roots of the vines and other trees. It is well %0aknown that this is done in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, %0aand it is a fact even better ascertained that the grape ripens %0aall the sooner for it ; indeed, the dust there contributes more %0ato its ripeness than the heat of the sun. %0a%0aCUAV. 6. MAOTEE. %0a%0aThere are various kinds of manure, the use of which is of %0avery ancient date. In the times of Homer"- even, the aged %0aking is represented as thus enriching the land by the labour of %0ahis own hands. Tradition reports that King Augeas was the %0afirst in Greece to make use of it, and that Hercules introduced %0athe practice into Italy ; which country has, however, immor- %0atalized the name of its king, Stercutus,'^ the son of Faunus, %0aas claiming the honour of this invention. M. Varro'* assigns %0athe first rank for excellence to the dung of thrushes kept in %0aaviaries, and lauds it as being not only good for land, but %0aexcellent food for oxen and swine as well ; indeed, he goes so %0afar as to assert that there is no food that they will grow fat upon %0amore speedily. We really have some reason to augur well of %0athe manners of the present day, if it is true that in the days %0aof our ancestors there were aviaries of such vast extent as to %0abe able to furnish manure for the fields. %0a%0aThough ashes fertilize the ground, more particularly when of an ar- %0agillaceous nature, they are not so extensively used now as in ancient times. %0aPliny alludes here more particularly to wood and dunghill ashes. %0aThis, however, he omits to do. %0a8' He alludes, probably, to Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 22. %0a52 Odyssey xxiv. 225. %0a%0a83 From "stcrcus," "dung."

Some authors, again, are agreed in re- %0agarding the residue of the human food'' as the very best of %0aall manures ; while others would only employ the superfluous %0aportion of our drink,''* mixing with it the hair that is to be %0afound in the curriers' workshops. Some, however, are for %0aemploying this liquid by itself, though tliey would mix water %0a■nith it once more, and in larger quantities even than when %0aoriginally mixed with the wine at our repasts ; there being a %0adouble share of noxious qualities to correct, not only those %0aoriginally belonging to the wine,"' but those imparted to it %0aby the human body as well. Such are the various methods %0aby which we vie with each other in imparting nutriment to %0athe earth even. %0a%0aNext to the manures above mentioned, the dung of swine is %0ahighly esteemed, Columella being the only writer that con- %0ademns it. Some, again, speak highly of the dung of all %0aquadrupeds that have been fed on cytisus, while there are %0aothers who prefer that of pigeons. Next to these is the %0adung of goats, and then of sheep ; after which comes that of %0aoxen, and, last of all, of the beasts of burden. Such were %0athe distinctions that were established between the various ma- %0anures among the ancients, such the precepts that they have left %0aus, and th(!se I have here set forth as being not the mere subtle %0ainventions of genius, but because their utility has been proved %0ain the course of a long series of years.

There was an old prejudice, that vegetation grown %0awith it has a fetid odour, but it has for some time been looked upon as %0a%0a^^Is^Or'^urine. In the vicinity of Paris, a manure is employed called %0aurate, of which urine forms the basis. , , , n f • %0a%0aFee seems to think that this passage means that the bad smell of urine %0ais imparted to it by the wine that is drunk. It is difficult to say what %0acould have been the noxious qualities imparted by wine to unne as a ma- %0anure, and Pliny probably would have been somewhat at a loss to explain %0ahis meaning. %0a%0a%0a%0a458 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINt's NATTJRAL niSTOKT. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XYir. %0a%0a%0a%0ason of their prolific soil, we have seen the maniire passed %0athrough a sieve like so much flour, and perfectly devoid, %0athrough lapse of time,* of all bad smell or repulsive look, %0abeing changed in its appearance to something rather agreeable %0athan otherwise. In more recent times it has been found that %0athe olive thrives more particularly in soil that has been ma- %0anured with the ashes^ of the lime-kiln. To the ancient rules %0aVarro^ has added, that corn land should be manured with horse- %0adung, that being the lightest manure of all, while meadow %0aland, he says, thrives better with a manure of a more heavy %0anature, and supplied by beasts that have been fed upon barley ; %0athis last tending more particularly to the better growth of %0agrass.* Some persons, indeed, prefer the dung of the beasts %0aof burden to that of oxen even, the manure of the sheep to %0athat of the goat, and the manure of the ass to all others, the %0areason being that that animal masticates the most slowly of %0athem all. Experience, however, has pronounced against these %0adicta of Varro and Columella ; but it is universally agreed by %0aall writers that there is nothing more beneficial than to turn' %0aup a crop of lupines, before they have podded, with either the %0aplough or the fork, or else to cut them and bury them in %0aheaps at the roots of trees and vines. It is thought, also, %0athat in places where no cattle are kept, it is advantageous to %0amanure the earth with stubble or even fern. " You can make %0amanure," Cato^ says, " of litter, or else of lupines, straw, %0abeanstalks, or the leaves of the holm-oak and quercus.

At whatever %0aperiod, however, it may be thought proper to manure the %0aland, the greatest care should be taken that the wind is blow- %0aing due west at the time, and that the moon is on the wane, %0aand quite drj'. Such precautions as these will increase in a %0amost surprising degree the fertilizing effects of manure. %0a%0aCHAP, 9. (10.) — THE MODES IN WHICH TEEES IJEAE. %0a%0aHaving now treated at sufficient length of the requisite con- %0aditions of the weather and the soil, we shall proceed to speak %0aof those trees which are the result of the care and inventive %0askill of man. Indeed, the varieties of them are hardly less %0anumerous than of those which are produced by Nature," so %0aabundantly have we testified our gratitude in return for her %0anumerous bounties. For these trees, we find, are reared either %0afrom seed, or else by transplanting, by layers, by slips torn from %0athe stock, by cuttings, by grafting, or by cutting into the trunk %0aof the tree. But as to the story that the leaves of the palm %0aare planted by the Babj'lonians, and so give birth'^ to a tree, %0aI am really surprised that Trogus should have ever believed %0ait. Some of the trees are reproduced by several of the me- %0athods above enumerated, others, again, by all of them. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. PLANTS WHICH ARE PROPAGATED BY SEED. %0a%0aIt is Nature herself that has tauglit us most of these me- %0athods, and more particularly that of sowing seed, as it was %0avery soon evident how the seed on falling to the ground revived %0a%0a/. e. in the early part of spring. In modern times, the period for %0amanuring varies, according to the usage of different localities, being prac- %0atised in aU the four seasons of the year, according to the crops, weather, %0aand climate. " See B. xvi. c. 58. %0a%0aTlie palm is grown in Africa from shoots tlirown out from the axillse %0aof the leaves; and it is in this circumstance, Fee thinks, that the story told %0aby Trogus must have originated. Some of the ferns throw out adventitious %0abuds from the summit of the leaf, and the orange tree and some others %0aoccasionally have them at the base of the leaf. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 11.] TEEES WHICH NEVEli DEGEKEEATE. 461 %0a%0a%0a%0aagain in germination. Indeed, there are some trees that are %0acapable of being propagated in no other way, the chesnut's %0aand the walnut, for instance ; with the sole exception, of course, %0aof such as are employed for coppice wood, Ey this method, %0atoo, as well as the others, some trees are propagated, though %0afrom a seed of a different nature, such, for instance, as the %0avine, the apple, and the pear ;-° the seed being in all these %0acases in the shape of a pip, and not the fruit itself, as in that of %0athe chesnut and the walnut. The medlar, too, can also be %0apropagated by the agency of seed. All trees, however, that are %0agrown by this method are very slow in coming to maturity,-' %0adegenerate" very rapidly, and must often be renewed by graft- %0aing : indeed, the chesnut even sometimes requires to be grafted. %0a%0aCHAP. 11. TREES WHICH NEVER DEGENKKATE. %0a%0aOn the other hand, there are some trees which have the pro- %0aperty of never degenerating, in whatever manner they are re- %0aproduced, the cypress, palm, and laurel,^^ for instance : for we %0afind that the laurel is capable of being propagated in several %0aways. "We have already made mention^* of the various kinds %0aof laurel ; those known as the Augustan, the baccalis, and the %0atinus'^^ are all reproduced in a similar manner. The berries %0aare gathered in the month of January, after they have been %0adried by the north-east winds which then prevail : they are %0athen kept^^ separate and exposed to the action of the air, being %0aUable to ferment if left in a heap. After this, they are first %0a%0a19 Virgil says, Georgics ii. 14 : %0a%0a" Pars autem posito surgunt de semine ; ut altse %0aCastanese. nemorumque Jovi qu* maxime froiidet." %0a2" This method of reproduction is seldom or never employed ; plants or %0acuttings only being used for the purpose. %0a%0a2» Besides which, it is doubtful if they will reproduce the variety, the %0aseed of which was originally sown. %0a%0aIn some cases, they are more particularly liable to disease— the apple, %0afor instance. %0a%0a^ Because the mode of cultivation adopted has little or no influence upon %0athem.

A trench is then dug, about a palm in depth, %0aand somewhere about twenty of the berries are then put into %0ait, being laid in a heap : this is usually done in the month of %0aMarch. These kinds of laurel admit of being propagated %0afrom layers also ; but the triumphaP' laurel can be reproduced %0afrom cuttings only. %0a%0aAll the varieties of the myrtle^" are produced in Campania %0afrom the berry only, but at Rome from layers. Democritus, %0ahowever, says that the Tarentine myrtle may be re-produced %0aanother way.^' They take the largest berries and pound them %0alightly so as not to crush the pips : with the paste that is thus %0amade a rope is covered, and put lengthwise in the ground ; %0athe result of which is that a hedge is formed as thick as a wall, %0awith plenty of slips for transplanting. In the same way, too, %0athey plant brambles to make a hedge, by first covering a rope %0aof rushes with a paste made of bramble-berries. In case of %0anecessity, it is possible at the end of three years to transplant %0athe suckers of the laurel and the myrtle that have been tlius %0are-produced. %0a%0aWith reference to the plants that are propagated jfrora seed, %0aMago treats at considerable length of the nut-trees — he says %0athat the almond'^ should be sown in a soft argillaceous earth, %0aupon a spot that looks towards the south — that it thrives also %0ain a hard, warm soil, but that in a soil which is cither unctuous %0aor moist, it is sure to die, or else to bear no fruit. He recom- %0amends also for sowing those more particularly which are of a %0acurved shape like a sickle, and the produce of a young tree, %0a%0a2' These methods of preparation are no longer employed. %0a%0a28 It is for this reason, as already stated, that they should be sown at %0aonce. %0a%0a29 See B. XV. c. 39. He there calls it " sterilis," " barren." %0a%0a30 See B. xv. c. 37. The myrtle reproduces itself in its native conntries %0aAvith great facility, but in such case the flowers are only single. "Wliere a %0adouble flower is required, it is grown from layers. %0a%0a31 No better, Fee says, than the ordinary method of niakino- a mvrtle %0ahedge. %0a%0a^2 The almond requires a dry, light earth, and a southern aspect. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0a%0aPEOPAGATION BY STJCKEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a463 %0a%0a%0a%0aand he says that they should be steeped for three days in %0adiluted manure, or else the day before they are sotvti in honey %0aand water.^ He says, also, that they should be put in the %0aground with the point downwards, and the sharp edge towards %0athe north-east ; and that they should be sown in threes and %0aplaced triangularly, at the distance of a palm from each other, %0acare being taken to water them for ten days, until such time %0aas they have germinated. %0a%0aWalnuts when sown are placed lengthwise,'* lying upon %0athe sides w'herc the shells are joined; and pine nuts are %0amostly put, in sevens, into perforated pots, or else sown in the %0asame way as the berries are in the laurels which are re-produced %0aby seed. The citron^* is propagated from pips as well as layers, %0aand the sorb from seed, by sucker, or by slip : the citro]i, how- %0aever, requires a warm site, the sorb a cold and moist one, %0a%0aCHAP. 12. PEOPAGATION BY SUCKERS. %0a%0aNature, too,^ has taught us the art of forming nurseries ; %0awhen from the roots of many of the trees we see shooting up a %0adense forest of suckers, an offspring that is destined to be %0akilled by the mother that has borne them. For by the shade %0aof the tree these suckers are indiscriminately stifled, as we %0aoften see the case in the laurel, the pomegranate, the plane, %0athe cherry, and the plum. There are some few trees, the elm %0aand the palm for instance, in which the branches spare the %0asuckers ; however, they never make their appearance in any %0aof the trees except those in which the roots, from their fond- %0aness for the sun and rain, keep close, as they range, to the %0asurface of the ground. It is usual not to place all these suc- %0akers at once in the ground upon the spot wliich they are finally %0ato occupy, but first to entrust them to the nursery, and to %0aallow them to grow in seed-plots, after which they are finally %0atransplanted. This transplanting softens down, in a most re- %0amarkable manner, those trees even which grow wild ; whether %0ait is that trees, like men, are naturally fond of novelty and %0a%0a33 These precautions are no longer observed at the present day. %0a%0a31 This precatition, too, is no longer observed. . , . %0a%0a^ The citron is produced, at the present day, from either the pips, plants, %0a%0aor cuttings. , . , . .- %0a%0a3« This passage is borrowed almost verbatim from \ irgil, Georgics u. %0a%0a60, et seq. %0a%0a%0a%0a464 %0a%0a%0a%0aplixy's nattjeal nisTOHT.

PEOPAGATION BY SLIPS AND CUTXriTOS. %0a%0aNature has also discovered another method, which is very %0asimilar to the last — for slips torn away from the tree will live. %0aIn adopting this plan, care should be taken to pull out the %0ahaunch^' of the slip where it adheres to the stock, and so re- %0amove with it a portion of the fibrous body of the parent tree. %0aIt is in this way that the pomegranate, the hazel, the apple, %0athe sorb, the medlar, the ash, the fig, and more particularly %0athe vine, are propagated. The quince, however, if planted in %0athis way will degenerate,^** and it has been consequently found %0aa better plan to cut slips and plant them : a method which %0awas at first adopted for making hedges, with the elder, the %0aquince, and the bramble, but came afterwards to be applied to %0acultivated trees, such as the poplar, the alder, and the willow, %0a"which last wiU grow if even the slip is planted upside down.^* %0aIn the case of cuttings, they are planted at once in the spot %0a■which it is intended they should occupy : but before we pass %0aon to the other methods of propagation, it seems as well to %0amention the care that should be expended upon making seed- %0aplots.« %0a%0aCHAP. 14. SEED-PLOTS. %0a%0aIn laying out a seed-plot it is necessary that a soil of the %0avery highest quality should be selected ; for it is very often %0arequisite that a nurse should be provided for the young plants, %0awho is more ready to humour them than their parent soil. The %0aground should therefore be both dry and nutritious, well %0a%0a37 " Pema." Tbis method of reproduction is still adopted, but it is not %0ato be recommended, as the young tree, before it throws out a root, is liable %0ato be overthrown by high winds. Virgil mentions it, Georg. ii. 23. %0a%0aPalladius only says that the growth of the quince in such case is very %0a%0aslow. %0a%0a2' This experiment has been tried for curiosity's sake, and has succeeded ; %0athe roots become dry, lose their fibres, and then develop buds, from which %0abranches issue ; while the buds of the summit become changed into roots. %0a" Seminarii :" " nurseries," as they are more commonly called. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 14.] .SEED PLOTS. %0a%0a%0a%0a465 %0a%0a%0a%0aturned up with the mattock, replete with hospitality to the %0astranger plants and as nearly as possible resembling the soil to %0awhich It IS intended they should be transplanted.

He says that it is in this way tliat the %0aseeds of the apple and the pear are reared, the pine-nut also, %0aand the cypress," which is propagated from seed as well. In %0athis last, the seed is remarkably^^ small, so much so, in fact, as %0ato be scarcely perceptible. It is a marvellous fact, and one which %0aought not to be overlooked, that a tree should be produced %0afrom sources so minute, while the grains of wheat and of %0abarley are so very much larger, not to mention the bean. %0aWhat proportion, too, is there between the apple and the %0apear tree, and the seeds from which they take their rise ? It %0ais from such beginnings, too, as these that springs the timber %0athat is proof against the blows of the hatchet, presses^* that %0aweights of enormous size even are unable to bend, masts that %0asupport the sails of ships, and battering-rams that are able to %0a%0a" The distance, in reality, ought to vary according to the nature and %0aspecies of the trees, and the heiglit they are to be allowed to attain. %0a« De Ec Eust. 48. %0a%0a*^ These precautions are not looked upon as necessary for the indigenous %0atrees at the present day.

But, a marvel that tran- %0ascends all the rest, is the fact of a vegetable receiving its birth %0afrom a tear-like drop, as we shall have occasion to mention" in %0athe appropriate place. %0a%0aTo resume, however : the tiny balls which contain the seed %0ai^e collected from the female cypress — for the male, as I have %0aalready''^ stated, is barren. This is done in the months which %0aI have previously'*^ mentioned, and they are then dried in the %0asun, upon which they soon burst, and the seed drops out, %0aa substance of which the ants are remarkably fond ; this fact, %0atoo, only serves to enhance the marvel, when we reflect that %0aan insect so minute is able to destroy the first germ of a tree %0aof such gigantic dimensions. The seed is sown in the month %0aof April, the ground being first levelled with rollers, or else %0aby means of rammers after which the seed is thickly sown, %0aand earth is spread upon it with a sieve, about a thumb deep. %0aIf laid beneath a considerable weight, the seed is unable to %0aspring up, and is consequently thrown back again into the %0aearth ; for which reason it is often trodden only into the %0aground. It is then lightly watered after sunset every three %0adays, that it may gradually imbibe the moisture until such %0atime as it appears above ground. The young trees are trans- %0aplanted at the end of a year, when about three-quarters of a %0afoot in length, due care being taken to watch for a clear day %0awith no wind, such being the best suited for the process of %0atransplanting. It is a singular thing, but still it is a fact, that %0aif, on the day of transplanting, and only that day, there is the %0aslightest drop of rain or the least breeze stirring, it is attended %0awith danger*' to the young trees ; while for the future they %0aai-e quite safe from peril, though at the same time they %0ahave a great aversion to all humidity.*^ The jujube- tree" is %0a%0aB. xix. c. 48, and B. xx. c. 11.

As to tlie %0atuber,*" It IS the best plan to graft it upon the wild plum, the %0aquince, and the calabrix," this last being the name that is %0agiven to a wild thorn. Every kind of thorn, too, will receive %0agrafts remarkably well from the myxa plum,« as well as %0afrom the sorb. %0a%0a(11.) As to recommending transferring the young plants from %0athe seed-plot to another spot before finally planting them out, %0aI look upon it as advice that would only lead to so much unne- %0acessary trouble, although it is most confidently urged that by %0athis process the leaves are sure to be considerably larger than %0athey otherwise would. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 15. THE MODE OF PEOPAGATING THE ELM. %0a%0aThe elm seed is collected about the calends of March, %0abefore the tree is covered with leaves, but is just beginning to %0ahave a yellow tint. It is then left to dry two days in the %0ashade, after which it is thickly sown in a broken soil, earth %0athat has been riddled through a fine sieve being thrown upon %0ait, to the same thickness as in the case of the cypress.*" If %0athere should happen to be no rain, it is necessary to water the %0aseed. From the nursery the young plants arc carried at the %0aend of a year to the elm-plots, where they are planted at inter- %0avals of a foot each way. It is better to plant elms in autumn %0athat are to support the vine, as they are destitute of seed %0aand are only propagated from plants. In the vicinity of the %0aCity, the young elms are transplanted into the vineyard at %0afive years old, or, according to the plan adopted by some, when %0athey are twenty feet in height.

These mounds %0aare known by the name of "arula"^' in Campania. The %0aintervals are arranged according to the nature of the spot ; but %0aAvhere the country is level, it is requisite that the trees should %0abe planted wider apart. Poplars and ashes, too, as they ger- %0aminate with greater rapiditj-, ought to be planted out at an %0aearlier period, or, in other words, immediately after the ides of %0aFebruary.^^ In arranging trees and shrubs for the support of %0athe vine, the form of the quincunx''^ is the one that is gene- %0arally adopted, and, indeed, is absolutely necessary : it not only %0afacilitates the action of the wind, but presents also a very %0apleasing appearance, for whichever way you look at the plan- %0atation, the trees will always present themselves in a straight %0aline. The same method is employed in propagating the poplar %0afrom seed as the elm, and the mode of transplanting it from %0athe seed-plot is the same as that adopted in transplanting it %0afrom the forests. %0a%0aCHAP. 16. — THE HOLES FOE TRANSPLANTING. %0a%0aBut it is more particularly necessary in transplanting, that %0athe trees should always be removed to a soil that is similar, or %0aelse superior," to the one in which they grew before. If taken %0afrom warm or early ripening localities, they ought not to be re- %0amoved to cold or backward sites, nor yet, on the other hand, from %0athese last to the former. If the thing can possibly be done, %0athe holes for transplanting should be dug sufficiently long be- %0afore to admit of their being covered throughout with a thick coat %0aof grass. Mago recommends that they should be dug a whole %0a%0aFrom bein^ about nine feet in circumference. %0a«' A little altar." 62 13th of February. %0a%0aI. e. each at an angle with the other, in this form : — %0a* * * %0a%0a* * %0a« « « %0a%0aIt was probably so called from the circumstance that each triancle resembles %0aV, or five. %0a%0a" This is the reason why a soil of only middling quality is generally %0aselected for nurseries and seed-plots; otherwise it niicht be difficult to %0atransplant the young trees to an improved soil. ° %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 16.] THE HOLES FOU TltANSPLAUTIXG. %0a%0a%0a%0a469 %0a%0a%0a%0ayear beforehand, in order that they may absorb the heat of %0athe sun and the moisture of the showers ; or, if circumstances %0ado not admit of this, that fires should be made in the middle %0aof them some two months before transijlantiug, that being only %0adone just after rain has fallen. He says, too, that in an argil- %0alaceous** or a hard soil, the proper measurement is three cubits %0aevery way, and on declivitous spots one palm more, care being %0ataken in every case to make the hole like the chimney of a %0afurnace, narrower at the orifice than at the bottom. Where %0athe earth is black, the depth should be two cubits and a palm, %0aand the hole dug in a quadrangular Ibrm. %0a%0aThe Greek writers agree in pointing out much the same %0aproportions, and are of opinion that the holes ought not to be %0amore than two feet and a half in depth, or more than two feet %0awide : at the same time, too, they should never be less than %0aa foot and a half in depth, even though the soil should be wet, %0aand the vicinity of Avater preclude the possibility of the soil %0agoing any deeper. " If the soil is wateiy," says Cato,'^ " the %0ahole should be three feet in width at the orifice, and one palm %0aand a foot at the bottom, and the depth four feet. It should %0abe paved, too, with stones,*' or, if they are not at hand, with %0astakes of green willow, or, if these cannot be procured, with a %0alayer of twigs ; the depth of the layer so made being a foot %0aand a half." %0a%0aIt appears to me that I ought here to add, after what lias %0abeen said with reference to the nature of trees, that the holes %0ashould be sunk deeper for those which have a tendency to run %0anear the surface of the earth, such as the ash and the olive, %0afor instance. These trees, in fact, and others of a similar %0anature, should be planted at a depth of four feet, while for the %0aothers three feet will be quite sufficient. " Cut down that %0astump," said Papirius Cursor, the general, when to the great %0a%0a■ 65 The ordinary depth, at the present day, is ahout two feet ; hut when %0ak an argillaceous soil, as Pliny says, the hole is made deeper.

To line the bottom with a layer of gravel would be %0ato follow a middle course between the two opinions. %0a%0aSome persons recommend that a tree should not be trans- %0aplanted before it is two years old, nor j-et after three, while %0aothers, again, are of opinion that if it is one year old it is %0aquite sufficient ; Cato'"' thinks that it ought to be more than %0afive fingers in thickness at the time. The same author, too, %0awould not have omitted, if it had been of any importance, to %0arecommend that a mark" should be made on the bark for the %0apuq)ose of pointing out the southern aspect of the tree; so %0athat, when transplanted, it may occupy exactlj^ the same posi- %0ation that it has previously done ; from an appi'eliension that %0athe north side of the tree, on finding itself opposite to a south- %0aei-n sun, might split, and the south side be nipped by the %0anorth-eastern blasts. Indeed, there are some persons who %0afollow a directly opposite practice even in the vine and the fig,'* %0aby placing the north side of the tree., when transplanted, to- %0awards the south, and vice versa ; being of opinion that by %0a%0athink it not inappropriate to introduce the story of Papirius, who, when %0aonly intending to have a stump cut down that grev.' in tlie way, took iLe %0aopportunity oi' frightening the praetor of Praent'ste, by the suddenness of %0athe order to his lictor, and probably the peremptorj' tone in which it was %0agiven.

This precaution, however, would be of more %0aimportance with exotic trees than indigenous ones. It is still practised to %0asome extent with the layers of the vine. %0a%0aFee suggests that Pliny may have here misunderstood a passage in %0aTheophrastus, Hist.

For %0amy own part, I sliould prefer tliat this part of the tree should %0atace that pojnt of the heavens which is occupied by the sun at %0athe filth" or even the eighth hour of the day. People are also %0aequally unaware that they ought not, tlirough neglect, to let %0athe roots be exposed to the air long enough to get dry ; and %0athat the ground should not be worked about the roots of' trees %0awhile the wind is blowing from the north, or, indeed, from %0aany point of the heavens that lies between north and south- %0aeast ; or, at all events, that the roots should not be left to lie %0aexposed to these winds ; the result of such modes of proceeding %0abeing, that the trees die, the grower being all the wliile in %0atotal ignorance of the cause. %0a%0aCato" disapproves, too, of all wind and rain whenever the %0awork of transplanting is going on. "Wlien this is the case, it %0awill be beneficial to let as much adhere to the roots as possible %0aof the earth in which the tree has grown, and to cover them %0aall round with clods" of earth : it is for this reason that Cato"' %0arecommends that the young trees should be conveyed in baskets, %0aa very desirable method, no doubt.

(12.) THE INTEEVAIS TO BE LKFT BETWEEN TREES. %0a%0aThe present seems to me to be tlie proper occasion for making %0asome mention of the intervals®^ that ought to be left between %0athe trees. Some persons have recommended that pomegra- %0anates, myrtles, and laurels should be planted closer together than %0athe other trees, leaving, however, a space of nine feet between %0athem. Apple-trees, they say, should be planted a little wider %0aapart, and pear-trees, almonds, and figs even still more so. %0aThe best rule, however, is to consult the length of the branches, %0aand the nature of the spot, as well as the shade that is formed %0aby the tree ; for it is of great importance to take this last into %0aconsideration. The shadow thrown by the large trees even is %0abut of sm-all dimensions, when the branches are disposed around %0a%0a83 See B. xix. c. 30. A somewhat similar practice is also recommended %0ain B.

THE NATDUE OF THE SHADOW THROWU BY TREES. %0a%0aThe shadows of trees are possessed of certain properties. %0aThat of the walnut is banefuP^ and injurious to man, in whom %0ait is productive of head-ache, and it is equally noxious to %0aeverything that grows in its vicinity. The shadow, too, of %0athe pine has the effect of killing" the grass beneath it ; but %0ain both of these trees the foliage presents an effectual resist- %0aance to the winds, while, at the same time, the vine is desti- %0atute of such protection."** The drops of water that fall from %0athe pine, the quercus, and the holm-oak are extremely heavy, %0abut from the cypress none fall ; the shadow, too, thrown by %0athis last tree is extremely small, its foliage being densely %0apacked.^' The shadow of the fig, although widely spread, is %0abut light, for which reason it is allowed to be planted among %0avines. The shadow of the elm is refreshing and even nuiri- %0ameutal to whatever it may happen to cover ; though, in the %0aopinion of Atticus, this tree is one of the most injurious of %0athem all ; and, indeed, I have no doubt that such may be the %0acase when the branches are allowed to become too long ; %0abut at the same time I am of opinion that when they are %0akept short it can be productive of no possible harm. The %0apUuie also gives a very pleasant shade, ^'^ though somewhat %0adense : but in this case we must look more to the luxuriant %0asoftness of the grass beneath it than the warmth of the sun ; %0afor there is no tree that forms a more verdant couch on which %0ato recline. %0a%0aThe poplar" gives no shade Avhatever, in consequence of the %0a%0a8" Sec B.

In all those Avhich are protected by a %0afoliage so dense that the rain Avill not pass through, the drops %0aare of a noxious nature."- In our enquiries, therefore, into %0athis subject it will be of the greatest consequence what will %0abe the nature developed by each tree in the soil in which we %0aare intending to plant it. Declivities, taken bj'^ themselves, %0arequire smaller"^ intervals between the trees, and in localities %0athat are exposed to the Avind it is beneficial to plant them %0acloser together. However, it is the olive that requires the %0alargest intervals to be left, and on this point it is the opinion %0aof Cato,^' with reference to Italy, that the very smallest in- %0aterval ought to be twenty- five feet, and the largest thirty : %0atins, however, varies according to the nature of the site. Tho %0aolive is the largest'*^ of all the trees in Ba3tica : and in Africa %0a— if, indeed, we maj^ believe the autliors who say so — there %0aare many olive-trees that are known by the name of milliariaj,** %0a%0a^- This is quite a fallacy. Even in the much more probable cases of %0athe upas and mangineel, it is not the fact. %0a%0aTheopbrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 8, says, that trees that grow on %0adeclivities have shorter branches than those of the same kind growing on %0aplains, ^^ De Re Ilust. c. 16. %0a%0aThis assertion is doubtful ; at the present day, in Andalusia, the %0apalm, the poplar, and many other trees are much larger than the olive. %0a%0a■JG "Thousand pounders."

There is no doubt, %0ahowever, that Baetica reaps the most prolific harvests from %0abetween her olives. %0a%0aIt will be generally agreed that it is a most disgraceful %0apiece of ignorance to lop away the branches more than is ab- %0asolutely necessary in trees of vigorous growth, and so pi'eci- %0apitate old age ; as also, on the other hand, what is generally tan- %0atamount to an avowal of unskilfulness on the jiart of those %0awho have planted them, to have to cut them down altogether. %0aNothing can reflect greater disgrace upon agriculturists than %0ato have to undo what they have done, and it is therefore much %0athe best to commit an error in leaving a superfluity of room. %0a%0a%0a%0aCIIAI'. 20.

Hence %0ait is, that a thing that is in itself most noxious and most %0abaneful, has taught us the art of reproduction by layers and %0aquicksets. The ivj*, too, has a similar property. %0a%0aCato ' says, that in addition to the vine, the fig, as well as %0athe olive, the pomegranate, every variety of the apple, the %0alaurel, the plum, the myrtle, the filbert, the nut of Proeneste, %0aand the plane, are capable of being propagated by layers. %0a%0aLayers- are of two kinds ; in the one, a branch, while still %0aadhering to the tree, is pressed downwards into a hole that %0ameasures four feet every way : at the end of two years it is %0acut at the part where it curves, and is then transplanted at %0athe expiration of three years more. If it is intended to carry %0athe plant to any distance, it is the best plan to place the layer, %0adirectly it is taken up, either in an osier basket or any earthen %0avessel, for its better security when carried. The other^ mode %0aof reproduction by layers is a more costly one, and is efi'ected %0aby summoning forth a root from the trunk of the tree even. %0aFor this purpose, earthen vessels or baskets are provided, and %0aare then well packed with earth ; through these the extre- %0amities of the branches are passed, and by tliis mode of encou- %0aragement a root is obtained growing amid the fruit itself, and %0aat the very summit of the tree ; for it is at the summit that %0athis method is generally adopted. In this way has a bold and %0adaring inventiveness produced a new tree aloft and far away %0afrom the ground. At the end of two years, in the manner %0aalready stated, the layer is cut asunder, and then planted in %0athe ground, basket and all. %0a%0aThe herb savin* is reproduced by layers, as also by slips ; it %0a%0a1 Be Re Rust. c. 51. %0a%0a* The French call cultivation by layers " marcotte," as applied to trees %0aill general ; and " provignage," as applicable to the vine.

We see a seed swallowed whole by a famished bird ; %0awhen softened by the natural heat of the crop, it is voided, %0awith the fecundating juices of the dung, upon some soft couch %0aformed by a tree ; or else, as is often the case, is carried by the %0awinds to some cleft in the bark of a tree. Hence' it is that %0awe see the cherry growing upon the willow, the plane upon %0athe laurel, the laurel upon the cherry, and fruits of various %0atints and hues all springing from the same tree at once. It is %0asaid, too, that the jack-daw, from its concealment of the seeds %0aof plants in holes which serve as its store-houses, gives rise to %0aa similar result. %0a%0aCHAP. 23. — rNOCIJLATION OR BUDDING. %0a%0aIn this, too, the art of inoculating ^ took its rise. By the %0aaid of an instrument similar to a shoe-maker's paring-knife %0aan eye is opened in a tree by paring away the bark, and %0aanother bud is then enclosed in it, that has been previously re- %0amoved with the same instrument from another tree. This was the %0aancient mode of inoculation with the fig and the apple. That %0aagain, described by Yirgil," requires a slight fissure to be %0amade in the knot of a bud which has burst through the bark, %0aand in this is enclosed a bud taken from another tree.

A %0acareful husbandman,'" being desirous, for its better protection, %0ato surround his cottage with a palisade, tlirust the stakes %0ainto growing ivy, in order to prevent them from rotting. %0aSeized by the tenacious grasp of the still living ivy, the stakes %0aborrowed life from the life of another wood, and it was found %0athat the stock of a tree acted in place of earth. %0a%0aFor this method of grafting the surface is made level with a %0asaw, and the stock carefully smoothed with the pi'uning-knife. %0aThis done, there arc two modes of proceeding, the first of %0awhich consists in grafting between the bark and the wood. %0aThe ancients were fearful at first of cutting into the wood, but %0aafterwards they ventured to pierce it to the very middle, and %0ainserted the graft in the pith, taking care to enclose but one, %0abecause the pith, they thought, was unable to receive more. An %0aimproved method has, however, in more recent times, allowed %0aof as many as six grafts being inserted, it being considered %0adesirable by additional numbers to make a provision for the %0acontingency of some of them not surviving. With this view, %0aan incision is carefully made in the middle of the stock, a thin %0awedge being inserted to prevent the sides from closing, until %0athe graft, the end of which is first cut to a point, has been let %0ainto the fissure. In doing this many precautions are neces- %0asary, and more particularly every care should be taken that %0athe stock is that of a tree suitable for the purpose, and that %0athe graft is taken from one that is proper for grafting. The %0asap," too, is variousl)' distributed in the several trees, and does %0anot occupy the same place in all. In the vine and the fig'- the %0amiddle of the tree is the driest, and it is in the summit that %0athe generative power resides ; hence it is, that from the top %0athe grafts are selected.

The mode of grafting here described is called by agricul- %0aturists in foreign countries, " Pliny's graft." %0a%0a" These statements as to the locality of the sap arc erroneous. %0a%0aThe fig is the only fruit that is not improved by gralting ; but then %0ait is not sinular to most fruit, being, as Fee say^ nothing more than a %0afleshy floral receptacle. %0a%0a%0a%0aCliap. 24.] %0a%0a%0a%0aVARIOUS KINDS OF QEAFTIKO %0a%0a%0a%0a479 %0a%0a%0a%0amiddle of the tree, and the grafts arc accordingly taken from %0athence : the upper part b(;ing comparatively dry. The graft %0atakes most easily in a tree, the bark of which is of a similar %0anature to its own, and which, blossoming at the same time as %0aitself, has an affinity with it in the development of the natural %0ajuices. On the other hand, the process of uniting is but slow %0awhere the dry is k>rought in contact with the moist, and the %0ahard bark with the soft. %0a%0a_ The other points to be observed are the following : the inci- %0asion must not be made in a knot, as such an inhospitable rigidity %0awill certainly repel the stranger plant ; the incision should be %0amade, too, in the part which is most compact, and it must not %0abe much more than three fingers in length, not in a slanting %0adirection, nor yet such as to pierce the tree from side to side. %0aVirgil'^ is cf opinion, that the grafts should not be taken from the %0atop, and it is universally agreed that it is best to select them from %0athe shoulders of the tree which look towards the north-east %0afrom a tree, too, that is a good bearer, and from a young shoot," %0aunless, indeed, the graft is intended for an old tree, in which %0acase it should be of a more robust growth. In addition to this, %0athe graft ought to be in a state of impregnation, that is to say, %0aswelling'' with buds, and giving every promise of bearing the %0asame year ; it ought, too, to be two years old, and not thinner %0athan the little finger. The graft is inserted at the smaller %0aend, when it is the object of the grower that it should not %0agrow to any considerable length, but spread out on either side. %0aBut it is more particularly necessary that the buds upon the %0agraft should be smooth and regular, and there must be nothing %0aUpon it at all scabbed or shrivelled. Success may be fully %0areckoned on if the pith of the graft is brought in contact with %0athe wood and bark of the stock ; that being a much better plan %0athan merely uniting them bark to bark.

The graft, however, must not be pointed %0awhile the wind is blowing, and care must be taken that the %0abark is not rubbed off from either graft or stock. The graft %0amust be thrust into the stock up to the point where the bark %0abegins ; care, too, must be taken not to wrench off the bark %0aduring the process of insertion, nor must it be thrust back so %0aas to form any folds or wrinkles. It is for this reason that a %0agraft should not be used that is too full of sap, no, by Hercules ! %0ano more than one that is dry and parched ; for by doing so, in %0athe former case, from the excess of moisture, the bark becomes %0adetached, and in the latter, from want of vitality, it yields %0ano secretions, and consequently will not incorporate with the %0astock. %0a%0aIt is a point most religiously" observed, to insert the graft %0aduring the moon's increase, and to be careful to push it down %0awith both hands ; indeed, it is really the fact, that in this ope- %0aration, the two hands, acting at the same moment, are of neces- %0asity productive of a more modified and better regulated effoist %0aGrafts that have been inserted with a vigorous effort are later %0ain bearing, but last all the longer ; when inserted more ten- %0aderly, the contrary is the result. The incision in the stock %0ashould not be too open or too large ; nor ought it to be too %0asmall, for in such case it would either force out the graft or %0aelse kill it by compression. But the most necessary precaution %0aof all is to see that the graft is fairly inserted, and that it %0aoccupies exactly the middle of the fissure in the stock. %0a%0aSome persons are in the habit of making the place for the %0afissure in the stock with the knife, keeping the edges of the %0aincision together with bands of osier bound tightly round %0athe stock ; they then drive in the wedges, the bands keep- %0aing the stock from opening too wide. There are some trees %0a%0a'8 In reprehending this absurd notion, Fee bestows a passin%3c» censure %0aon tiie superstitions of this nature, contained in the English Vox Stella- %0arum, one of our almanacks ; and in the French "Almanach des Bergers," %0a" Sheplierds' Almanack." %0a%0ai» This is borrowed by Palladius, in the operations of February, tit. %0a17, and October, tit. 12. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 24.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTAEI0U8 OF GEA.FTINQ. %0a%0a%0a%0a481 %0a%0a%0a%0athat are grafted m the seed-plot and then transplanted the %0avery same day. If the stock used for grafting is of very con- %0asiderable thickness, it is the best plan to insert the graft be- %0atween the bark and the wood; for which purpose a wedge %0amade of bone is best, for fear lest when the bark is loosened %0athe wood should be bruised. In the cherry, the bark is removed %0abefore the incision in the stock is made ; this, too, is the only %0atree that is grafted after the winter solstice. When the bark %0a18 removed, this tree presents a sort of downy substance, which, %0aif it happens to adhere to the graft, will very speedily destroy %0aIt. When once the graft is safely lodged by the aid of the %0awedge, it is of advantage to drive it home. It is an excellent %0aplan, too, to graft as near the ground as possible, if the con- %0aformation of the trunk and knots will admit of it. The graft %0ashould not project from the stock more than six fingers in %0alength. %0a%0aCato^" recommends a mixture of argiP' or powdered chalk, %0aand cow-dung, to be stirred together till it is of a viscous consis- %0atency, and tlien inserted in the fissure and rubbed all round %0ait. From his writings on the subject it is very evident that %0aat that period it was the practice to engraft only between tlie %0awood and the bark, and in no other way; and that the graft %0awas never inserted beyond a couple of fingers in depth. He %0arecommends, too, that the pear and the apple sliould be grafted %0ain spring, as also during fifty days at the time of the summer %0asolstice, and during the time of vintage ; but tliat the olive %0aand the fig should be grafted in spring only, in a thirsting, or %0ain other words, a dry moon : he says also, that it should be %0adone in the afternoon, and not while a south wind is blowing. %0aIt is a singular thing, that, not content with protecting the %0agraft in tlie manner already mentioned, and with slieltcring %0ait from showers and frosts by means of turfs and supple bands %0aof split osiers, he recommends that it sliould be covered w^ith %0abugloss*^ as well — a kind of herb so called — which is to be %0atied over it and then covered up with straw. At the present %0aday, however, it is thought sufficient to cover the bark with a %0a%0a20 I)e Re Rust. 40. %0a%0a2' This is the ongucnt Saint-Fiacre of the French, and is still used to %0aprotect the graft from all contact with the exterior air. %0a%0a"Altitudinem," as Dalechamps suggests, would appear to be a better %0areading than " latitudinem."

The pear %0amay be grafted even when in blossom, so that with it the %0aoperation may be safely delayed to the month of May even. %0aIf grafts of fruit trees have to be carried to any distance, it %0ais considered the best plan, with the view of preserving the %0ajuices, to insert them in a turnip; they may also be kept alive %0aby placing them near a stream or a pond, between two hollow %0atiles covered up at each end with earth.

The %0afirst consists in piercing the stock to the pith, and then insert- %0aing the grafts, sharpened at the end, in manner already men- %0ationed, care being taken to bring the pith of the two in con- %0atact. The second is adopted in case the two vines are near %0aone another, the sides of them both being cut in a slanting %0adirection where they face each other ; after which the pith of %0athe two trees is united by tying them togethor. In employ- %0aing the third method, the vine is pierced obliquely to the %0apith, and grafts are inserted a couple of feet in length ; they %0aare then tied down and covered over with prepared earth, care %0abeing taken to keep them in an upright position. In our %0a%0a21 Borrowed from Columella, B. iv. c. 29. This method is still em- %0aployed for young plants; in France it is called "salting" the plants. %0a2^ De Ee Rust. 41. %0a%0a2« The first of these methods is now the only one at all employed %0awith the vine ; indeed, it is more generally reproduced by means of layers %0aand suckers. %0a%0a%0a%0aCbap. 26.] %0a%0a%0a%0aGRAFTING BY SCUTCilKOXS. %0a%0a%0a%0a483 %0a%0a%0a%0atimo, however, this method has been greatly improved by %0amaking use of the G illic auger,-' which pierces the tree witli- %0aout scorching it ; it being the fact, that everything that burns %0athe tree weakens its pow(>rs. Cure, too, is taken to select a %0agraft that is just beginning to germinate, and not to leave %0amore than a couple of the buds protruding from the stock. %0aTlio vine, too, should be carefully bound with wilhes of elft, %0aincisions being made in it on either side, in order that the %0aslimy juices may exude through them in preference, which %0aare so particularly injurioiis to the vine. After this, when %0athe graft has grown a couple of feet, the withe by v,'hich it is %0afastened should be cut, and the graft left to increase of its own %0anatural vigour. %0a%0aThe proper time^" for grafting the vine has been fixed as %0afrom the autumnal equinox to the beginning of the budding %0aeeason. The cultivated plants arc generally grafted on the %0aroots of wild ones, where tliese last are of a drier nature. ]^ut if %0aa cultivated tree should be grafted on a wild one, it will very %0asoon degenerate and become wild.'^* The rest depends entirely %0aon the weather. Dry weather is the best suited for grafting; %0aan excellent remedy for any evil effects that may possibly be %0acaused by the drought, being a few pots of earth placed near %0athe stock and filled with ashes; through which a little water %0ais slowly filtered.

A similar %0apiece of bark from another tree, with a protuberant bud upon %0ait, is then inserted in its place, care being taken that the union %0ais so exact that there is no room left for a cicatrix to form, and %0athe juncture so perfect as to leave no access to either damp or %0aair : still, however, it is always the best plan to protect the %0ascutcheon by means of a plaster of clay and a band. Those who %0afavour the modern fashions pretend that this method has been %0aonly discovered in recent times ; but the fact is, that we find %0ait employed by the ancient Greeks, and described by Cato,^* %0awho recommends it for the olive and the fig ; and he goes so %0afar as to determine the very dimensions even, in accordance %0awith his usual exactness. The scutcheon, he says, when taken %0aoff with the knife should be four^^ fingers in length, and three %0ain breadth. It is then fitted to the spot which it is to occupy, %0aand anointed with the mixture of his which has been pre- %0aviously described.^* This method, too, he recommends for the %0aapple. %0a%0aSome persons have adopted anotlier plan with the vine, %0awhich consists partly of that of grafting by scutcheon, and %0apartly by fissure ; they first remove a square piece of bark %0afrom the stock, and then insert a slip in the place that is thus %0alaid bare. I once saw at Thuliae,^^ near Tibur, a tree that hud %0abeen grafted upon all these various ways, and loaded with fruit %0aof every kind. Upon one branch there were nuts to be seen, %0aupon another berries, upon another grapes, upon another %0apears, upon another figs, and upon others pomegranates, and %0a%0a" "Scutula."

He thinks it %0apossible, however, that a kind of mock grafting may have been produced %0ain the case, still employed in some parts of Italy, and known as the %0a" greffe-Diane." A trunk of an orange tree is split, and slips of numerous %0atrees are than passed into it, wliich in time throw out their foliage and %0ablossoms in various parts of the tree, or at the top ; the consequence of %0awhich is, that the stock appears to boar several varieties of blossoms at the %0asame moment. It is not improbable that Piiny was thus imposed upon. %0a%0a%0a%0aCliap. 27.] PLANTS WHICH OUOW FEOM A BRANCH. 485 %0a%0a%0a%0aseveral varieties of the apple ; the tree, however, w as but %0avery short-lived. But, with all our experiments, we find %0ait quite impossible to rival Nature ; for there are some %0aplants that can be reproduced in no other manner than spon- %0ataneously, and then only in wild and desert spots. The plane'" %0ais generally considered the best adapted to receive every kind %0aof graft, and next to it the robur; both of them, however, %0aare very apt to spoil the flavour of the fruit. Some trees %0aadmit of grafting upon them in any fashion, the fig and the %0apomegranate for instance ; the vine, however, cannot be %0agrafted upon by scutcheon, nor, indeed, any other of the trees %0awhich has a bark that is thin, weak, or cracked. So, too, %0athose trees which are dry, or which contain but little moisture, %0awill not admit of grafting by inoculation. This last method is %0athe most prolific of them all, and next to it that by scutcheon, %0abut neither of them can be depended upon, and this last more %0aparticularly ; for when the adherence of the bark is the only %0apoint of union the scutcheon is liable to be immediately dis- %0aplaced by the slightest gust of wind. Grafting by insertion is %0athe most reliable method, and the tree so produced wiU bear %0amore fruit than one that is merely planted. %0a%0a(17.) We must not here omit one very singular circum- %0astance.

At a later period again, %0aEtercius, his freedman, grafted the Corellian^'* chesnut afresli. %0aThere is this difference between the two; the Corellian is %0amore prolific, biit the Etereian is of superior quality. %0a%0aCHAP. 27.

Take care, too, not to make a hole first with the %0adibble, for the slip will have the better chance of surviving the %0aother way. When the slip is three years old, due care must be %0ataken to observe tlie direction in which each side of the bark is %0asituate. If you are planting in holes or furrows, you must %0aput in the cuttings by threes, but be careful to keep them %0aseparate. Above ground, however, they should not be more %0athan four fingers distant fi'om one another, and each of them %0amust have a bud or eye above ground. In taking up the olive %0afor transplanting, you must use the greatest caution, and see %0athat there is as much earth left about the roots as possible. %0aAVhen you have covered the roots well up, tread down the %0aearth with the foot, so that nothing may injure the plant." %0a%0aCHAP. 30. TK.VNSPLA.NTING OPEKATIONS AS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH- %0a%0a001 THE VARIOUS SKASONS OF THE THAR. %0a%0aIf the enquiry is made what is the proper season for plant- %0aing the olive, my answer will be, " where the soil is dry, at %0aseed-time ; Avhcre it is rich, in spring." The following is the %0aadvice given by Cato" on the subject : "Eegin pruning your %0aolive-yard fifteen days before the vernal ecjuinox ; from that %0aperiod for forty days Avill be a good time for doing so. In %0apruning, adopt the following rules : when the ground is ex- %0atremely productive, remove all the dry branches or such as %0amay have been broken by the wind ; where it is not so pro- %0alific, you must cut away still more, then tie them well up, %0aand remove all tangled branches, so as to lighten the roots. %0aIn auturnn clear away the roots of the olive, and then manure %0athem. The man who labours most assiduously and most %0aearnestly will remove the very smallest fibres that are attached %0ato the roots. If, however, he hoes negligently, the roots will %0asoon appear again above ground, and become thicker than %0aever ; the consequence of which will be, that the vigour of the %0atree wall be expended in the roots." %0a%0aWe have already stated, when speaking on the subject ot %0a« De Re Eust. 44. The rules Lore given are still very generally ob- %0aserved. %0a%0a%0a%0a488 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's NATUBAL HISTOHT. [Book XVII. %0a%0a%0a%0aoil," what are the different varieties of the olive, in what kind %0aof soil it ought to be planted, and what is the proper aspect %0afur the olive-yard. Mago recommends that the olive should %0abe planted on declivities and in dry spots, in an argillaceous %0asoil, and between autumn and the winter equinox. If, on the %0aother bund, the soil is thick, humid, or somewhat damp even, %0ait ought to be planted between harvest and the winter solstice ; %0aadvice, however, it should be remembered, applicable to Africa %0amore particularly. At the present day, it is mostly the custom %0ain Italy to plant the olive in spring, but if it is thought de- %0asirable to do so in the autumn as well, there are only four days %0ain the forty between the equinox and the setting of the Vcr- %0agiliae that are unfavourable for planting it.*' It is a practice %0apeculiar to Africa, to engraft the olive on the wild olive only, %0aa tree which is made to be everlasting, as it Avere ; for when it %0abecomes old the best of the suckers are carefully trained for %0aadoption by grafting, and in this way in another tree it %0agrows young again ; an operation which may be repeated con- %0atinuously as often as needed ; so much so, indeed, that the %0asame olive-yard will last for ages.*" The wild olive also is %0apropagated both by insertion and inoculation. %0a%0aIt is not advisable to plant the olive in a site where the %0aquercus has been lately rooted up ; for the earth-worms, known %0aas " raucae," which breed in the root of the quercus, are apt %0ato get into that of the olive. It has been found, from practical %0aexperience, that it is not advisable to bury the cuttings in the %0aground nor yet to dry them before they are planted out. Ex- %0aperience has also taught us that it is the best plan to clean an %0aold olive-yard every other year, between the vernal equinox %0aand the rising of the Vergiliae, and to lay moss about the roots ; %0ato dig holes also round the trees every year, just after the %0asummer solstice, two cubits wide by a foot in depth, and to %0amanure them every third year, %0a%0aMago, too, recommends that the almond should be planted %0abetween the setting of Arcturus" and the winter solstice.

The laurel should be planted between the %0asetting ot the Eagle and that of the Arrow ; for we find that %0athe proper time for planting is equally connected with the aspect %0aof the heavenly bodies. For the most part it has been recom- %0amended that this should be done in spring and autumn ; but %0athere is another appropriate period also, though known to but %0afew, about the rising of the Dog-star, namely ; it is not, how- %0aever, equally advantageous in all localities. Still, I ought not %0ato omit making mention of it, as I am not setting forth the %0apeculiar advantages of any one country in particular, but am %0aenquiring into the operations of Nature taken as a whole. %0a%0aIn the region of Cyrenaica, the planting is generally done %0awhile the Etesian^* winds prevail, and the same is the case in %0aGreece, and with the olive more particularly in Laconia. At %0athis period, also, the vine is planted in the island of Cos ; and %0ain the rest of Greece they do not neglect to inoculate and graft, %0athough they do not*" plant, their trees just then. The natural %0aqualities, too, of the respective localities, exercise a very consi- %0aderable influence in this respect ; for in Egypt they plant in %0aany month, as also in all other countries where summer rains %0ado not prevail, India and .^Ethiopia, for instance. When trees %0aare not planted in the spring they must be planted in autumn, %0aas a matter of course. %0a%0aThere are three stated periods, then, for germination;" spring, %0athe rising of the Dog-star, and that of Arcturus. And, indeed, %0ait is not the animated beings only that are ardent for the pro- %0apagation of their species, for this desire is manifested in even %0aa greater degree by the earth and all its vegetable productions ; %0ato employ this tendency at the proper moment is the most %0a%0a«^ B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%0a" B. ii. c. 47, and B. xviii. c. 68. %0a%0a^ There is a contradiction here ; a few lines above, he says that they %0a%3cfo plant their trees in Greece at this period.

Tliese %0amoments, too, are of peculiar importance in relation to the %0aprocess of grafting, as it is then that the two productions ma- %0anifest a mutual desire of uniting. Those who prefer the spring %0alor grafting commence operations immediately after the vernal %0aequinox, reckoning on the fact that then the buds are just %0acoming out, a thing that greatlj^ facilitates the union of the %0abarks. On the other hand, those who prefer the autumn graft %0aimmediately after the rising of Arcturus, because then the graft %0aat once takes root in some degree, and becomes seasoned for %0aspring, so as not to exhaust its strength all at once in the pro- %0acess of germination. However, there are certain fixed periods %0aof the j'ear, in all cases, for certain trees ; thus, the cherry, %0afor instance, and the almond, are either planted or grafted about %0athe winter solstice. Tor many trees the nature of the locality %0awill be the best guide ; thus, where the soil is cold and moist %0ait is best to plant in spring, and where it is dry and hot, in %0aautumn. %0a%0aTaking Italy in general, the proper periods for these opera- %0ations may be thus distributed : — The mulberry is planted at %0aany time between the ides of February*- and the vernal equi- %0anox ; the pear, in the autumn, but not bej^ond the fifteenth %0aday before tlie winter solstice ; the summer apples, the quince, %0athe sorb, and the plum, between mid-winter and the ides of %0aFebruary : the Greek carob*^ and the peach, at any time in %0aautumn before the winter solstice ; the various nuts, such as %0athe walnut, pine, filbert, almond, and chesnut, between the %0acalends of March" and the ides of that month the willow %0aand the broom about the calends of March.

(20.) — WILLOW-BEDS. %0a%0aIt now remains to give an account of those trees which are %0aplanted for the sake of others — the vine"" more particularlj^ — %0aand the wood of which is cut from time to time. Holding the %0avery first rank among these we find the willow, a tree that is %0aalways planted in a moist soil. The hole, however, should be %0atwo feet and a half in depth, and the slip a foot and a half %0aonly in length. Willow stakes are also used for the same %0apurpose, and the stouter they are the better : the distance left %0abetween these last should be six feet. When they are thre* %0ayears old their growth is checked by cutting them down %0awithin a couple of feet from the ground, the object being to %0amake them spread out, so that by the aid of their branches %0athey may be cleared without the necessity of using a ladder ; %0afor the willow is the more productive the nearer its branches %0aare to the ground. It is generally recommended to trench %0around the willow every year, in the month of April. Such %0ais the mode of cultivation employed for the osier willow.^' %0a%0aThe stake wiUow^ is reproduced both from suckers and %0acuttings, in a trench of the same dimensions.

It is planted by placing the bulb of %0athe root, that part which some people call the "eye,"*^ in a %0atrench three quarters of a foot in depth, at intervals of two %0afeet and a half. A reed-bed will renew itself spontaneously %0aafter the old one has been rooted up, a circumstance which it %0ahas been found more beneficial to take advantage of than %0amerely to thin them, as was formerly the practice ; the roots %0abeing in the habit of creeping and becoming interlaced, a %0athing that ends eventually in the destruction of the bed. The %0aproper time for planting reeds is before the eyes begin to swell, %0aor, in other words, before the calends of March.*' The reed %0acontinues to increase until the winter solstice., but ceases to do %0a80 when it begins to grow hard, a sign that it is tit lor cutting. %0aIt is generally thought, too, that the reed requhes to be %0atrenched round as often as the vine. %0a%0aThe reed also is planted in a horizontal position,^ and then %0acovered with earth to a very great depth ; by this method as %0amany plants spring up as there are eyes. It is propagated, also, %0aby planting out in trenches a foot in depth, care being taken to %0acover up two of the eyes, while a third knot is left just on a %0alevel with the ground ; the head, too, is bent downwards, that %0ait may not become charged with dew.

It retpiires a soil that is light without %0abeing gravelly, a moist, sandy one more particularly, or else a %0acharcoal earth," or a fine tufa " even ; while at the same time %0aa northern aspect, however cold and shady, and if upon a %0adeclivity even, greatly promotes its growth. It refuses to %0agrow, however, in a gravelly soil, or in rod earth, chalk, or, %0aindeed, anj^ kind of fertilizing ground. We have already %0astated,'* that it is reproduced from the nut, but it will %0aonly grow from those of the largest size, and then only when %0athey are sown in heaps of five together. The ground' above %0athe nuts should be kept broken from the month of November %0ato February, as it is at that period that the nuts lose their %0ahold and fall of themselves from the tree, and then take %0aroot. There ought to be intervals of a foot in width left %0abetween them," and the hole in which they are planted should %0abe nine inches every way. At the end of two years or more %0athey are transplanted from this seed plot into another, where %0athey are laid out at intervals of a couple of feet. %0a%0aLayers are also employed for the reproduction of this tree, %0aand there is none to which they are better'* adapted : the root %0aof the plant is left exposed, and the layer is placed in the %0atrench at full length, with the summit also protruding from %0athe earth ; the result being, that it shoots from the top as well %0a%0a70 « Pedamenta," uprights, stays, stakes, or props. %0a" This is not the fact, for the chesnut both grows and buds very slowly, %0aA black, hot kind of earth.

When transplanted, however, it is very hard to be %0areconciled, as it stands in dread of all change. Hence it is %0athat It IS nearly two years before it will begin to shoot upward ; %0aIrom which circumstance it is generally preferred to rear the %0aslips in the nursery from tlie nut itself, to obtaining them from %0aquicksets. The mode of cultivation does not differ from that %0aemployed with the i)lant8 already mentioned." It is trenched %0aaround, and carefully lopped for two successive years; after %0awhich it IS able to take care of itself, the shade it gives sufficing %0atx) stifle all superfluous suckers : before the end of the sixth %0ayear it is fit for cutting. %0a%0aA single jugerum of chesnuts will provide stays for twenty %0ajugera of vineyard, and the branches that are taken from near %0athe roots afford a supply of two-forked uprights ; they will last, %0atoo, till after the next cutting of the tree. %0a%0aThe ajsculus,'" too, is grown in a simihir manner, the time %0afor cutting being three years at the latest. Being less diffi- %0acult, too, to propagate, it may be planted in any kind of eartli, %0athe acorn — and it is only with the sescnlus that this is done — %0abeing sown in spring, in a hole nine inches in depth, with in- %0atervals between the plants of two feet in width. This tree is %0alightly hoed, four times a year. This kind of stay is the least %0alikely to rot of them all ; and the more the tree is cut, the %0amore abundantly it shoots. In addition to the above, they %0aalso grow other trees for cutting that we have already men- %0ationed — the ash for instance, the laurel, the peach, the hazel, %0aand the apple ; but then they are of slower growth, and the %0astays made from them, when fixed in the ground, are hardly %0aable to withstand the action of the earth, and much less any %0amoisture. The elder, on the other hand, which affords stakes %0aof the very stoutest quality, is grown from cuttings, like the %0apoplar.

The in- %0atervals between these joints in the branches are short, and %0amore particularly so towards the extremities. The pith, in %0aitself the vivifying spirit of the tree, is always taking an %0aonward direction, so long as the knot, by being open in the %0acentre, allows it a free passage. If, however, the knot should %0abecome solidified and deny it a passage, the pith is then thrown %0adownward upon the knot that lies next below it, and making %0aits escape, issues forth there in the shape of a bud, these buds %0aalways making their appearance on each side alternately, as %0aalready mentioned in the case of the reed and the giant- %0afennel in other words, where one bud makes its appearance %0aat the bottom of a knot to the right, the next one takes its place %0aon the left, and so on alternately. In the vine this bud is known %0aas the " gem,"*^ as soon as the pith has formed there a small %0around knob ; but before it has done this, the concavity that is %0aleft upon the surface is merely called the " eye when situate %0aat the extremity of the shoot, it is known as the " germ."*" %0aIt is in the same way, too, that the stock branches, suckers, %0agrapes, leaves, and tendrils of the vine are developed : and it %0ais a very surprising fact, that aU that grows on the right" %0aside of the tree is stronger and stouter than on the left. %0a%0aHence it is, that when slips of this tree are planted, it is %0anecessary to cut these knots in the middle, in order to prevent %0athe pith from making its escape. In the same way, too, %0awhen planting the fig, suckers are taken, nine inches in length, %0aand after the ground is opened they are planted with the part %0adownwards that grew nearest to the tree, and with a couple of %0aeyes protruding from the earth — in slips of trees, that part is %0aproperly called the eye which is to give birth to the future %0abud. It is for this reason that, in the seed-plots even the %0a%0aludes to the trees from which the upriglits or stays for the vine are cut, or %0awhich produce osiers for baskets and bindings required in the vintage. %0a81 See B. xiii. c. 42, and B. xvi. c. 65. %0a%0a" Gemma."

Fig-trees that are thus planted may %0avery easily be transplanted in the third year. As some com- %0apensation for the rapidity with which this tree becomes ^« old %0ait has thus received the privilege of coming to maturity" at a %0avery early period. %0a%0aThe vine throws out a great number of shoots. In the first %0aplace, however, none of them are ever used for planting, %0aexcept those which are useless, and would have been cut away %0aas mere brushwood ; while, on the other hand, every part is %0apruned off that has borne fruit the previous year. In former %0atimes, it was the custom to plant the slip with a head at the %0aextremity, consisting of a piece of the hard wood on each side %0aof it, the same, in fact, that is called a mallet shoot at the %0apresent day. In more recent times, however, the practice %0ahas been adopted of pulling it off merely with a heel attached %0ato it, as in the fig and there is no kind of slip that takes %0awith greater certainty. A tliird method, again, has been added %0ato the former ones, and a more simple one as well, that of %0ataking the slip without any heel at all. These slips are %0aknown by the name of arrow-^shoots, when they arc; twisted %0abefore planting ; and the same, when they are neither cut %0ashort nor twisted, are called three-budded"' slips. The same %0asucker very often furnishes several slips of this kind. To %0aplant a stock-shoot*- of the vine is unproductive, and, indeed, %0ano shoots will bear unless they are taken from a part that has %0aborne fruit already. A slip that has but few knots upon it, is %0alooked upon as likely not to bear ; while a great number of %0abuds is considered an indication of fruitfulncss. Some persons %0asay that no suckers ought to be planted, but those which have %0aalready blossomed.

It is considered %0athe most advantageous plan to plant them out the same day %0athat they are cut ; but if it is found necessary to plant them %0asome time after, they should be kept in the way that we have %0aalready mentioned particular care being taken not to let %0athem protrude from the earth, lest they should become dried %0aby the action of the sun, or nipped by the wind or frost. %0aWhen they have been kept too long in a dry place, they must %0abe put in water for several days, for the purpose of restoring %0atheir verdancy and freshness. %0a%0aThe spot selected, whether for nursery or vineyard, ought %0ato be exposed to the sun, and of as great extent as possible ; %0athe soil being turned up to a depth of three feet with a two- %0apronged fork.

When this %0aIS done, they throw out eyes, and with these upon them at the %0aend ot three years the quicksets are transplanted. %0a%0aIhereis another method, also, of planting^ the vine, which %0aa luxurious refinement in these matters has introduced. Four %0amaUet-shoots are tightly fastened together with a cord in the %0agreenest part, and when thus arranged are passed through the %0ashank-bone of an ox or else a tube of baked earth, after whicli %0athey are planted in the ground, care being taken to leave a %0acouple of buds protruding : in this way they become impreg- %0anated with moisture, and, immediately on being cut, throw out %0afresh wood. The tube is then broken, upon which the root, %0athus set at liberty, assumes fresh vigour, and the clusters== ulti- %0amately bear upon them grapes belonging to the four kinds %0athus planted together. %0a%0aIn consequence of a more recent discovery, another method %0ahas been adopted. A mallet-shoot is split down the middle %0aand the pith extracted, after which the two portions are fastened %0atogether, every care being taken not to inj ure the buds. The %0amallet-shoot is then planted in a mixture of earth and manure, %0aand when it begins to throw out branches it is cut, the ground %0abeing repeatedl}^ dug about it. Columella^ assures us that the %0agrapes of this plant will have no stones, but it is a more sur- %0aprising thing that the slip itself should survive when tlius de- %0aprived of the pith.'' Still, however, I think I ought not to %0aomit the fact that there are some slips that grow without the or- %0adinary articulations of trees upon them ; thus, for instance, five %0aor six very small sprigs of box,* if tied together and put in %0athe ground, will take root. It was formerly made a point to %0atake these sprigs from a box-tree that had not been lopped, as %0ait was fancied that in the last case they would not live ; expe- %0arience, however, has since put an end to that notion. %0a%0aThe culture of the vineyard naturally follows the training %0aof the nursery. There are five* difterent kinds of vine : thai %0a%0a' Tliis method is no longer nscd. %0a%0a- This, Fee remarks, is not the case : the tree might bear four kinds of %0agrapes, but not four kinds on the same hunch. %0a•* De Arbor, c. 9.

The mode of cultivation requisite for the %0apropped vine may be understood as equally adapted to the one %0athat stands by itself and requires no support, for this last me- %0athod is only employed where there is a scarcity of Avood for stays. %0aThe stay with the single cross-piece in a straight line is known %0aby the name of " canterius." It is the best of all for the %0awine, for then the tree throws no shadow, and the grape is %0aripened continuously by the sun, while, at the same time, it %0aderives more advantage from the action of the wind, and dis- %0aengages the dew with greater facility : the superfluous leaves %0aand shoots, too, are more easily removed, and the breaking up %0aof the earth and other operations about the tree are effected %0awith greater facility. But, above all, by the adoption of this %0amethod, the tree sheds its blossoms more beneficially than %0aunder any other circumstances. This cross-piece is generally %0amade of a stake, or a reed, or else of a rope of hair or hemp, %0aas is usually the case in Spain and at Brundisium. When the %0atrellis is employed, wine is produced in greater quantities ; %0athis method has its name of " compluviata" from the " com- %0apluvium" or square opening in the roofs of our houses ; the %0atrellis is divided into four compartments by as many cross- %0apieces. This mode of planting the vine will now be treated %0aof, and it will be found equally applicable to every kind, with %0athe only difference that under this last method the operation %0ais somewhat more complicated. %0a%0aThe vine is planted three different ways ; in a soil that has %0abeen turned up with the spade — the best of the three ; in fur- %0arows, which is the next best ; and in holes, the least advisable %0amethod of all : of the way in which ground is prepared by %0adigging, we have made sufficient mention already.

The depth %0arequired for every kind of vine is three feet ; it should, there- %0afore, be made a point not to transplant any vine that is less %0athan three feet in length, allowing then two buds to be above %0athe ground. It will be necessary, too, to soften the earth by %0aworking little furrows at the bottom of the hole, and mixing %0ait up Avith manure. Where the ground is declivitous, it is %0arequisite that the hole should be deeper, in addition to which %0ait should be artificially elevated on tlie edge of the lower side. %0aHoles of this nature, which are made a little longer, to receive %0atwo vines, are know^n as "alvei," or beds. The root of the %0avine should occupy the middle of the liolc, and when firmly %0afixed in the ground it should incline at the top due east ; its %0afirst support it ought to receive from a reed.''' The vineyard %0ashould be bounded by a decuman^'' path eighteen feet in width, %0asufficiently wide, in fact, to allow two carts to pass each other ; %0aothers, again, should run at right angles to it, ten feet in %0awidth, and passing through the middle of each jugerum ; or %0aelse, if the vineyard is of very considerable extent, cardinal'* %0apaths may be formed instead of them, of the same breadth as %0athe decuman path. At the end, too, of every five of the stays a %0apath should be made to run, or, in other words, there should %0abe one continuous cross-piece to every five stays ; each space %0athat is thus included from one end to the other forming a %0abed.'^ %0a%0aWhere the soil is dense and hard it must be turned up only %0awith the spade, and nothing but quicksets should be planted %0athere ; but where, on the other hand, it is thin and loose, %0amallet-shoots even may be set either in hole or furrow. Where %0athe ground is declivitous it is a better plan to draw furrows %0aacross than to turn up all the soil with the spade, so that the %0afalling away of the earth may be counteracted by the position %0aof the cross-pieces.'« It will be best, too, where the weatlier %0a%0aarc made to run as much as possible from east to west.

In a %0aparched soil, too, it would be quite in vain to plant quicksets, %0aand it is far from advantageous to set mallet-shoots in a dry %0aground, except just after a fall of rain. On the other hand, %0ain moist localities, a vine in leaf eveii may be transplanted and %0athrive very M'ell, and that, too, even as late as the summer %0asolstice, in Spain, for example. It is of very considerable ad- %0avantage that there should be no wind stirring on the day of %0aplanting, and, though many persons are desirous that there %0ashould be a south wind blowing at the time, Cato" is of quite %0aa different way of thinking. %0a%0aIn a soil of medium quality, it is best to leave an interval of %0afive'^ feet between every two vines ; where it is very fertile %0athe distance should be five feet at least, and where it is poor %0aand thin eight at the very most. The Umbri and the Marsi %0aleave intervals between their vines of as much as twenty feet %0ain length, for the purpose of ploughing between them ; such %0aa plot of ground as this they call by the name of "porcule- %0atum," In a rainy, foggy locality, the plants ought to be set %0awider apart, but in diy spots nearer to one another. Careful %0aobservation has discovered various methods of economizing %0aspace ; thus, for instance, when a vineyard is planted in %0ashaded ground, a seed-plot is formed there as well ; or, in %0aother words, at the same time that the quickset is planted in %0athe place which it is finally to occupy, the mallet-shoot in- %0atended for transplanting is set between the vines, as well as %0abetween the rows. By adopting this method, each jugerum %0awill produce about sixteen thousand quicksets ; and the result %0ais, that two years' fruit is gained thereby, a cutting planted %0abeing two years later in bearing than a quickset transplanted. %0aQuicksets, when growing in a vineyard, are cut down at %0athe end of a year, leaving only a single eye above ground ; %0a%0amore especially as it agrees with what has been previously said in this %0aChapter in reference to declivitous ground. %0a" De Re Rust. 40. %0a%0a1* He differs somewhat in these measurements from Columella, B. %0aiv. c. 11. %0a%0a%0a%0aCliap. 3.3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aCPLTUUE OF THE VIXE. %0a%0a%0a%0a503 %0a%0a%0a%0asome manure is then placed npon the Bpot, and a stay driven %0ain close to the plant. In the same manner it is a^^ain cut %0adown at the end of the second year, and from this it acquires %0aadditional strength, and receives nutriment to enable it to %0aendure the onerous task of reproduction . If this is neglected %0am Its over-haste to bear it will shoot up slim and meagre %0alike a bulrush, and from not being subjected to such a train- %0aing, will grow to nothing but wood. In fact, there is no tree %0athat grows with greater eagerness than the vine, and if its %0astrength is not carefully husbanded for tlie bearing of fruit, it %0awill be sure to grow to nothing but wood. %0a%0aThe best props for supporting the vino are those which we %0ahave already mentioned,^" or else stays made of the robur and %0athe olive; if these cannot be procured, then props of juniper, %0acypress, laburnum, or elder,-' must be employed. If any oilier %0awood is used for the purpose, the stakes should be cut at the %0aend each year : reeds tied together in bundles make excellent %0across-rails for the vine, and will last as long as five years. %0aSometimes the shorter stock-branches of the vines are brought %0atogether and tied Avith vine-cuttings, like so many cords : by %0athis method an arcade is formed, known to us by the name of %0a" funetum." %0a%0aThe vine, by the end of the third year, throws out strong %0aand vigorous stock-branches Avith the gicatest rapidity, and %0athese in due time form the tree ; after tliis, it begins to mount %0athe cross-piece. Some persons are in the habit of " blinding" %0athe vine at this period, by removing tlie eyes with the end of %0athe pruning-knife turned upwards, their object being to in- %0acrease the length of the branches — a most injurious practice, %0ahowever ; for it is far better to let the tree become habituated %0ato grow of itself, and to prune away the tendrils every now %0aand then when they have reached the cross-rail, so long as it %0amay be deemed proper to add to its strength. There are some %0apersons who forbid the vine to be toucliod for a whole year %0aafter it has been transplanted, and avIio say that tlie pruning- %0aknife ought never to, be used before it is five years old ; and %0a%0a»» This is condemned by Columella, B. iv. c. 11 ; but is approved of by %0aVirgil, Cato, and otber autbors. %0a2" In c. 34 of this Book. %0a%0a21 Stays of elder would be utterly worthless, as they would soon rot, and %0abreak directly, upon the least strain. %0a%0a%0a%0a504 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's NATUEAIi HISTOEr. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVII. %0a%0a%0a%0athen at that period they are for cutting it down bo completely %0aas to leave three buds only. Others, again, cut down the vine %0awithin a year even after it has been transplanted, but then %0athey take care to let the stem increase everj' year by three or %0afour joints, bringing it on a level with the cross-piece by the %0afourth. These two methods, however, both of them, retard the %0afruit and render the tree stunted and knotty, as we see the %0acase in all dwarf trees. The best plan is to make the parent %0astem as robust and vigorous as possible, and then the wood %0awill be sure to be strong and hardy. It is far from safe, too, %0ato take slips from a cicatrized stem ; such a practice is erro- %0aneous, and only the result of ignorance. All cuttings of this %0anature are sure to be the offspring of acts of violence, and not %0ain reality of the tree itself. The vine, while growing, should %0abe possessed of all its natural strength ; and we find that %0awhen left entirely to itself, it will throw out wood in every %0apart ; for there is no portion of it that Nature does not act %0aupon. When the stem has grown sufficiently strong for the %0apurpose, it should at once be trained to the cross-piece ; if, how- %0aevei", it is but weak, it should be cut down so as to lie below %0athe hospitable shelter of the cross-piece. Indeed, it is tlie %0astrength of the stem, and not its age, that ought to decide the %0amatter. It is not advisable^* to attempt to train a vine before %0athe stem has attained the thickness of the thumb ; but in the %0ayear after it has reached the frame, one or two stock- branches %0ashould be preserved, according to the strength developed by %0athe parent tree. The same, too, must be done the succeeding %0ayear, if the weakness of the stem demands it ; and in the next, %0atwo more should be added. Still, however, there should never %0abe more than four branches allowed to grow; in one word, %0athere must be no indulgence shown, and every exuberance in %0athe tree must in all cases be most carefully repressed ; for %0asuch is the nature of the vine, that it is more eager to bear %0athan it is to live. It should be remembered, too, that all that %0ais subtracted from the wood is so much added to the fruit. %0aThe vine, in fact, would much rather produce shoots and ten- %0adrils than fruit, because"* its fruit, after all, is but a transitory %0apossession : hence it is that it luxuriates to its owti undoing, %0aand instead of really gaining ground, exhausts itself. %0a%0a21 This applies solely, Fee observes, to the vine trained on the trail or %0across-piece. %0a%0a^* This certainly appears to be a non sequitur, as applied to the vine. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 35.] CULTUEE OF THE VINE. 505 %0a%0aThe nature too, of the soil will afford some very useful %0asuggestions Where It IS thin and hungry, even though the %0avine should display considerable vigour, it should be pruned %0adown below the cross-piece and kept tbere, so that all the %0ashoots may be put forth below it. The interval, however, be- %0atwecn the top of the vine and the cross-piece ought to be but %0avery small ; so much so, indeed, as to leave it hopes, as it %0awere, ot reaching it, which, however, it must never be suffered %0ato do ; for it should never be allowed to recline thereon and %0aspread and run on at its ease. This mode of culture ought, in %0afact, to_ be so nicely managed, that the vine should show an %0ainclination rather to grow in body than to run to wood. %0a%0aThe main branch should have two or three buds left below %0athe cross-piece that give promise of bearing wood, and it %0ashould be carefully trained along the rail, and drawn close %0ato it in such a manner as to be supported by it, and not %0amerely hang loosely from itl When this is done, it should %0abe tightly fastened also Avith a binding three buds off, a %0amethod which will greatly contribute to check the too abun- %0adant growth of the wood, while stouter shoots will be thrown %0aout b(!low the ligature : it is absolutely forbidden, how- %0aever, to tie the extremity of the main branch. When all %0athis is done. Nature operates in the following way — the parts %0athat are allowed to fall downward, or those which are held fast %0aby the ligature, give out fruit, those at the bend of the branch %0amore particularly. On the other hand, the portion that lies %0abelow the ligature throws out wood ; by reason, I suppose, of %0athe interception of the vital spirit and the marrow or pilli, pre- %0aviously mentioned r*^ the wood, too, that is grown under these %0acircumstances wiU bear fruit in the following year. In this %0away there are two kinds of stock branches : the first of which, %0aissuing from the solid stock, gives promise of wood only for %0athis year, and is known as the leaf stock-branch Avhile that %0aAvhicli grows beyond the mark made by the ligature is a i'ruit %0astock-branch.-" There are other kinds, again, that shoot from %0athe stock-branches when they arc a year old, and these are in %0aall cases fruit stock-branches. There is left, also, beneath the %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aupon %0a%0a%0a%0a26 In the present Chapter.

Close to it there is another bud lett, no bigger than a %0awart; this is known as the " furunculus," and is kept in %0areadiness in case the reserve slioot should fail. %0a%0aThe vine, if enticed to bear fruit before the seventh year %0afrom its being planted as a slip, will pine^' away, become as %0aslim as a bulrush, and die. It is thought equally undesirable, %0atoo, to let an old stock-branch range far and wide, and extend %0aas far as the fourth stay from the stem ; to such a branch the %0aname of dragon^^-branch is given by some, and of juniculus by %0aothers ; if these are allowed to spread, they will run to wood %0aonly, and make male vines, as they are called. When a vine %0ahas become quite hard, it is an extremely bad plan to use it. %0afor reproduction by layers. When the vine is five j'cars old %0athe stock-branches are twisted, but each is allowed to throw %0aout some new wood ; and so from one to another, care being %0ataken to prune away the old wood. It is always the best %0aplan, however, to leave a reserve shoot ; but this should always %0abe very near the main stem of the vine, not at a greater dis- %0atance, in fact, than that already mentioned. If, too, the %0astock branches should throw out too luxuriantly, they must %0abe twisted, the object being that the vine may put forth no %0amore than four secondary branches, or even two only, if it %0ahappens to be a single cross-railed vine. %0a%0aIf the vine is to be trained to grow without any stay at all, %0astill it will stand in need, at first, of some support or other, %0auntil it has learnt to support itself : in all other respects the %0amode of proceeding will be the same at fii'st. When pruning, %0ait will be necessary that the thumb-branches^* should be ar- %0aranged in equal numbers on either side, in order that the fruit %0amay not overload one side of the tree ; and we may here remark %0aby the way, that the fruit by its weight is apt to bear down %0athe tree and counteract any tendency to increase in height. %0aThe vine, unsupported, when more than three feet in height, %0abegins to bend, but the others do not, until they are five feet %0a%0a30 The pilferer, "or little thief," apparently. %0a%0a31 This, Fee observes, is not in accordance with the fact. %0a%0a32 " Draco."

Growers %0aare in the habit of surrounding the vines that creep aW the %0aground with a low fence^^ for them to lean upon; and round %0athis fence they dig a trench by way of precaution, for fear lost %0athe branches in their range should meet one another and so %0acome into collision. The greater part of the world, in fact, %0agather grapes at their vintage, grown in this fashion, and lying %0aupon the ground— at all events, it is so in Africa, Egvpt, and %0abyria ; tliroughout the whole of Asia, too, and in many parts %0aoi Europe as well, this method prevails. In such cases the %0avine ouglit to be kept down close to the ground, and the root %0ashould be nurtured at the same time and in just the same way %0aas in the case of the vine that grows on the cross-piece. Care, %0atoo, should be taken to leave only the young thumb-shoots, %0atogether with three buds, where it is a prolific soil, two where %0ait is poor and thin : it is better, too, that the shoots should be %0anumerous than individually long. The influences of soil, of %0awhich we have made mention already, will make themselves %0afelt all the more powerfully the nearer the grapes grow to the %0aground. %0a%0aIt is a very advantageous plan to separate^ the various %0aspecies of vines and to set them in different compartments — %0afor the mixture of different varieties is apt to deteriorate the %0aflavour not only of the must, but the wine even as well. If, %0aagain, for some reason or other, the different kinds must be %0aintermingled, it will be requisite to keep all those together %0awhicli ripen at exactly the same period. The more fertile and %0athe more level the soil, the higher the cross-pieces must be %0aplaced." High cross-pieces, too, are best suited to localities %0athat are subject to heavy dews and fogs, but not to those %0athat are exposed to high winds ; on the other hand, wliere the %0asoil is thin, parched, and arid, or exposed to the wind, the %0across-pieces should be set lower.

Many per- %0asons recommend that the vineyard should be turned up with %0athe spade after every dew that falls in the summer. Others, %0aagain, forbid this practice when the vine is in bud ; for the %0aclothes, they say, of tlie jjeople coming and going to and fro %0aare apt to catcli the buds, and either knock or rub them off ; %0ait is for this reason, too, that they ai'e so careful to keep all %0aanimals away from the vines, those with long wool in parti- %0acular, as it is verj' apt to pull off the buds. Halving, too, %0athey say, is very injurious to the vine Avhile the grape is form- %0aing ; and it Avill be quite sufficient, they assure us, if the %0aground is turned up three times in the j'oar, after the vernal %0aequinox — first, at the rising of the Vergiliae,^' the second at %0athe rising of the Dog-star, and the third time just as the grape %0ais turning black. Some persons make it a rule that an old %0avineyard shall have one turning up between the time of vin- %0atage and the winter solstice, though others, again, are of opi- %0anion that it is quite sufficient to bare the roots and manure %0athem. They turn up the ground again after the ides of April,*" %0abut before the time for germination, or, in other words, the %0asixth of the ides of May then again before the tree begins %0ato blossom, after it has shed its blossom, and, last of all, %0awhen the grape is just on the turn. The most skilful growers %0asay that if the ground is dug up oftener than necessary, the %0agrapes will become so remarkably thin-skinned as to burst. %0aWhen the ground is turned up, care should be taken to do it %0abefore the hot hours of the day ; a clayey soil, too, should %0anever be ploughed or dug.

This point, however, may be decided %0aby following the advice of Cato on the subject ; for we must %0anow pass on to a description of the proper mode of nruninjr %0athe vine. i b %0a%0aImmediately after" the vintage, and while the weather is still %0awarm, the work of pruning" begins ; this, however, ought never %0ato be done, for certain physical reasons,*^ before the rising of the %0aEagle, as we shall have occasion to explain in the following %0aBook. Nor sliould it be done either when the west winds %0abegin to prevail, for even then there is great doubt whether a %0afault may not be committed by being in too great haste to %0acommence the work. If any return of wintry weather should %0achance to nip the vines, while still labouring under the wounds %0arecently inflicted on them in pruning, there is little doubt %0athat their buds will become quite benumbed with cold, the %0awounds will open again, and the eyes, moistened by the juices %0atliat distil from the tree, will become frost-bitten by the rigour %0aof the weather. For who is there,'"' in fact, that does not know %0athat the buds are rendered brittle by frost ? All this, how- %0aever, depends upon accurate calculations in the management of %0alarge grounds, and the blame of precipitation cannot with any %0ajustice be laid upon Nature. The earlier the vine is pruned, %0ain suitable weather, the greater is the (quantity of wood, while %0athe later the pruning, the more abundant is the fruit. Hence %0ait is that it is most advisable to prune the poor meagre vines %0afirst, and to defer pruning the more thriving ones to the very %0alast. In pruning, due care should always be taken to cut in %0aa slanting direction, in order^'' that the rain may run off with %0aall the greater facility. The wounds, too, should look down- %0a%0aof a higher colour, but in no degree riper than they otherwise would have %0abeen. %0a%0a" The proper period for pruning varies in reality according to the %0aclimate. %0a« See B. xviii. c 59. %0a%0a« See Columella, De Kc Rust. B. iv. c. 29. %0a%0aThe real reason, as Fee remarks, is the comparative facility of cutting %0aaslant rather than horizontally ; indeed, if the latter were attempted, injury %0ato the wood would be the certain result. %0a%0a%0a%0a510 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's kattjeal histoey. [BookXVir. %0a%0a%0a%0awards towards the ground, and should be made as lightly as %0apossible, the edge of the knife being well-sharpened for the %0apurpose, so as to make a clean cut each time. Care should be %0ataken, too, to cut always between two buds, and that the eyes %0aare not injured in the operation. It is generally thought that %0awherever the vine is black, all those parts may be cut off, the %0ahealthy parts not being touched ; as no useful shoots can be %0aput forth by wood that is bad in itself. If a meagre vine has %0anot good stock-shoots, the best plan is to cut it down to the %0aground, and then to train new ones. In clearing away the %0aleaves, too, those leaves should not be removed which accompany %0athe clusters, ,for by so doing the grapes are made to fall off, ex- %0acept where the vine happens to be young. Those leaves are %0aregarded as useless which grow on the sides of the trunk and %0anot from an eye ; and so, too, are the bunches which shoot %0afrom the hard, strong wood, and are only to be removed by the %0aaid of the knife. %0a%0aSome persons are of opinion that it is a better plan to fix %0athe stay midway between two vines ; and, indeed, by the adop- %0ation of this method the roots are cleared with greater facility. %0aIt is best, however, where the vine needs but a single cross- %0arail, due care being taken that the rail is a strong one, and the %0alocality not exposed to high winds. In the case of those %0avines which require trellissed cross-rails, the stay should be %0aplaced as near as possible to the burden it has to support ; in %0aorder, however, that there may be no impediment thrown in %0athe way of clearing the roots, it may be placed at the distance %0aof one cubit from the stock, but not more. It is generally %0arecommended to clear the roots before the pruning" is com- %0amenced. %0a%0aCato*' gives the following general precepts in relation to the %0aculture of the vine : — " Let the vine grow as high as possible, %0aand fasten it firmly, but not too tight. You should treat it in %0athe following manner. Clean the roots of the vine at seed- %0atime, and after pruning it dig about it, and then begin to %0alabour at the ground, by tracing with the plough continuous %0afurrows every way. Plant the young vines in layers as early %0aas possible, and then break up the ground about them. If the %0a%0a*8 The pruning should come first, in every case, Fee says. %0a*3 De Ke Rust, c 33. The advice given by him, though good, is not %0aapplieahle to all vineyards. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 35.J %0a%0a%0a%0aCULTURE OF THE TINE. %0a%0a%0a%0a.511 %0a%0a%0a%0aVine IS old, take care and prune it as little as possible. In %0apreference, bend the vine into the ground for layers, if neces- %0asary, and cut it at the end of two years. The proper time for %0acutting the young vine, is when it has gained sufficient %0astrength. If the vineyard is bald of vines, then draw furrows %0abetween them, and plant quicksets there : but let no shadow %0abe thrown on the furrows, and take care and dig them often. %0aIf the vineyard is old, sow ocinum* there, in case the trees are %0ameagre : but take care and sow there nothing that bears seed. %0aPut manure, chaff, and grapc-liusks about the roots, or, in- %0adeed, anything of a similar nature that will give the tree ad- %0aditional strength. As soon as the vine begins to throw out %0aleaves, set about clearing them. Fasten the j-oung trees in %0amore places than one, so that the stem may not break. As %0asoon as it begins to run along the stay, fasten down the young %0abranches lightly, and extend them, in order that they may gain %0athe right position. When the grape begins to be mottled, %0athen tie down the vine. The first season for grafting the vine %0ais the spring, the other when the grape is in blossom ; the last %0aperiod is tlie best. If it is your wish to transplant an old %0avine, 5'ou will only be able to do so in case it is no thicker than %0athe arm : first, however, you must prune it, taking care not to %0ahave more than two buds upon the stem. Then dig it well up %0aby the roots, being careful to trace them, and using every %0apossible precaution not to injure them. Place it in the hole or %0afurrow exactly in the position in which it has stood before, %0athen cover it with earth, which should be well trodden down. %0aYou must then prop it up, fasten it, and turn it in the same %0adirection as before ; after which, dig about it repeatedly." The %0aocinum that Cato here recommends to be sown in the vine- %0ayards, is a fodder known by that name by the ancients ; it %0athrives in the shade remarkably well, and received its name*' %0afrom the rapidity with which it grows. %0a%0a(23.)

Indeed, %0aScrofa himself will not admit that it is beneficial anywhere %0aexcept in Itah'. The experience of ages, however, has suffi- %0aciently proved that the wines of the highest quality are only %0agrown upon -vdncs attached to trees, and that even then the %0aclioicest wines are produced by the upper part of the tree, the %0aproduce of the lower part being more abundant ; such being the %0abeneficial results of elevating the vine. It is with a view to %0athis that the trees employed for this purpose are selected. In %0athe first rank of all stands the elm," with the exception of the %0aAtinian. variety, which is covered with too many leaves ; and %0anext comes the black poplar, which is valued for a similar %0areason, being not so densely covered with leaves. Most people, %0atoo, by no means hold the ash and the fig in disesteem, as %0aalso the olive, if it is not overshadowed with branches. We %0ahave treated at sufficient length already of the planting and %0aculture of these several trees. %0a%0aThey must not be touched with the knife before the end of %0athree years ; and then the branches are preserved, on each side %0ain its turn, the pruning being done in alternate years. In the %0asixth year the vine is united to the tree. In Italy beyond the %0aPadus, in addition to the trees already mentioned, they plant %0afor their vines the cornel, the opulus, the linden, the maple, %0athe ash, the yoke-elm, -and the quercus ; while in Vcnetia they %0agrow willows for the purpose, on account of the humidity" of %0athe soil. The top of the elm is lopped away, and the branches %0aof the middle are regularly arranged in stages ; no tree in %0ageneral being allowed to exceed twenty feet in height. The %0astories begin to spread out in the tree at eight feet from the %0aground, in the hilly districts and upon dry soils, and at tv/elve %0ain champaign and moist localities. The hands*^' of the trunk %0aought to have a southern aspect, and the branches that project %0afrom them should be stiff and rigid like so many fingers ; at %0athe same time due care should be taken to lop off the thin %0abeardlike twigs, in order to check the growth of all shade. %0aThe interval best suited for the trees, if it is the grower's in- %0atention to keq) the soil turned up with the plough, is forty feet %0aback and front, and twenty at the side ; if it is not to be turned %0a%0a5* All these trees are still employed for the puroose in Italy. %0a*5 B. xvi. c. 68. 56 Palmte.

A single tree h %0aotten made to support as many as ten vines, and the grower is %0agreatly ceusured who attaches less than three. It is worse %0athan useless to attach the vine before the tree has gained its %0afull strength, as in such case its rapidity of growth would %0aonly tend to kill the tree. It is necessary to plant the ^-ine %0ain a trench three feet in depth, leaving an interval of one %0afoot between it and the tree. In this case there is no neces- %0asity for using mallet shoots, or for going to any expense in %0aspading or digging ; for this method of training on trees has %0athis advantage in particular, that it is beneficial even to the %0avine that corn should be sown in the same soil ; in addition to %0awhich, from its height, it is quite able to protect itself, and %0adoes not call for the necessity, as in the case of an ordinary %0avineyard, of enclosing it with walls and hedges or ditches, %0amade at a considerable expense, to protect it from injury by %0aanimals. %0a%0aIn the method of training upon trees, reproduction from %0aquicksets or from layers is the only mode employed of all %0athose that have been previously described ; the growing by %0alayers being effected two different ways, as already mentioned. %0aThe plan, however, of growing from layers in baskets set upon %0athe stages^ of the tree is the most approved one, as it ensures %0aan efiicient protection from the ravages of cattle ; while, accord- %0aing to another method, a vine or else a stock-branch is bent %0ainto the ground near the tree it has previously occupied, or else %0athe nearest one that may be at liberty. It is recommended %0athat all parts of the parent tree that appear above ground %0ashould then be scraped, so that it may not throw out wood ; %0awhile at the same time there are never less than four buds on %0athe part that is put into the ground for the purpose of taking %0aroot ; there are also two buds left above ground at the head. %0aThe vine intended for training on a tree is planted in a furrow %0afour feet long, three broad, and two and a half in depth. At %0athe end of a year the layer is cut to the pith, to enable it to %0astrengthen gradually at the root ; after which, the end of the %0abranch is pruned down to within two buds from the ground. %0aAt the end of two years the layer is completely separated %0afrom the stock, and buried deeper in the ground, that it may %0a%0a%0a%0a" From Columella, B. v. c. 7. %0a%0a*8 This method is no longer employed. %0a%0aVOL. in. %0a%0a%0a%0aL L %0a%0a%0a%0a514 %0a%0a%0a%0apliny's natural histobt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[J3ook XVI r. %0a%0a%0a%0anot shoot at the place where it has been cut. As to the quick- %0asets, they ought to be removed directly after the vintage. %0a%0aIn more recent times, a plan has been discovered of planting %0aa dragon branch near the tree — that being the name given to %0aan old stock-branch that has become hard and tough in the %0acourse of years. For this purpose, it is cut as long as pos- %0asible, and the bark is taken of£ from three-fourths of its length, %0athat being the portion which is to be buried in the ground ; %0ahence it is, too, that it is called a " barked" plant. It is %0athen laid at full length in the furrow, the remaining part pro- %0atruding from the ground and reclining against the tree. This %0amethod is the most speedy one that can be adopted for growing %0athe vine. If the vine is meagre or the soil impoverished, it is %0ausual to keep it cut down as near to the ground as possible, %0auntil such time as the root is strengthened. Care, too, should %0abe taken not to plant it covered with dew,*** nor yet Avhile the %0awind is blowing from the north. The vine itself ought to %0alook towards the north-east, but the young stock-shoots should %0ahave a southern aspect. %0a%0aThere should not be too great haste" in pruning a young %0avine, but a beginning should be made by giving the wood and %0afoliage a circular form, care being taken not to prune it until %0ait has become quite strong ; it should be remembered, too, %0athat the vine, when trained upon a tree, is generally a year %0alater in bearing fruit than when grown on the cross-piece. %0aThere are some persons, again, who altogether forbid that a %0avine should be pruned until such time as it equals the tree in %0aheight. At the first pruning it may be cut to within six feet %0afrom the ground, below which a shoot must be left, and en- %0acouraged to run out by bending the young wood. Upon this %0ashoot, when pruned, there should not be more than three buds %0aleft. The branches that take their rise from these buds should %0abe trained in the following year upon the lowermost stages of %0athe tree, and so in each successive year taught to climb to the %0ahigher ones. Care, too, should always be taken to leave one %0ahard, woody branch at each stage, as well as one breeding %0ashoot, at liberty to mount as high as it pleases. In addition %0ato these precautions, in all pruning, those shoots should be cut %0aoff which have borne fruit the last year, and after the teu- %0a%0a" Columi.l]a, B. v. c. 6. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 35.] CULTUEE OF THE TINB. 515 %0a%0adrils" have been cut away on every side fresli branches should %0abe trained to run along the stages. In Italy the pruning is so %0amanaged that the shoots and tendrils of the vines are arranged %0aso as to cover the branches of the tree, while the shoots of the %0avine in their turn are surrounded with clusters of grapes. In %0aIrallia, on the other hand, the vine is trained to pass from tree %0ato tree. On the iEmilian Wav, again, the vine is seen em- %0abracing the trunks of the Atinian elms that line the road, %0awhile at the same time it carefully avoids their foliage.%3c« %0a%0aIt is a mark of ignorance in some persons to suspend the %0avine with a cord beneath the branches of the tree, to the great %0arisk of stifling it ; for it ought to be merely kept up with a %0awithe of osier, and not tightly laced. Indeed, in those places %0awhere the willow abounds, the withes that it affords are pre- %0aferred, on account of their superior suppleness, while the Sici- %0ahans employ for the purpose a grass, which they call " ampelo- %0adesraos throughout the whole of Greece, rushes, cj'perus, %0aand 6fdge«* are similarly employed. When at any time the %0avine has been liberated from its bonds, it should be allowed to %0arange uncontrolled for some days, and to spread abroad at %0apleasure, as well as to recline upon the ground which it has %0abeen looking down upon the whole year through. For in the %0asame manner that beasts of burden when released from the %0ayoke, and dogs when they have returned from the chase, love %0ato roll themselves on the ground, just so does the vine delight %0ato stretch its loins. The tree itself, too, seems to rejoice, and, %0athus relieved from the continuous weight which has burdened %0ait, to have all the appeai'ance of now enjoying a free respira- %0ation. Indeed, there is no object in all the economy of Nature %0athat does not desire certain alternations for the enjoyment of %0arest, witness the succession of night and day, for instance. It %0ais for this reason that it is forbidden to prune the vine directly %0athe vintage is over, and while it is still exhausted by the %0aprocess of reproduction. %0a%0aDirectly the vine has been pruned, it ought to be fastened %0aagain to the tree, but in another place ; for there is no doubt %0athat it feels very acutely the indentations that are made in it %0a%0a^ Capreolis.

In the Gallic method of cultivation they %0atrain out two branches at either side, if the trees are forty fet^t %0aapart, and four if only twenty; where they meet, these branches %0aare fastened together and made to grow in unison ; if, too, they %0aare anywhere deficient in number or strength, care is taken %0ato fortify them by the aid of small rods. In a case, however, %0awhere the branches are not sufficiently long to meet, they are %0aartificially prolonged by means of a hook, and so united to the %0atree that desires their company. The branches thus trained to %0aunite they used to prune at the end of the second year. But %0aAvhere the vine is aged, it is a better plan to give them a longer %0atime to reach the adjoining tree, in case they should not have %0agained the requisive thickness ; besides Avhich, it is always %0agood to encourage the growth of the hard wood in the dragon %0abranches. %0a%0aThere is yet another method,** which occupies a middle %0aplace between this mode of propagation and that by layers. %0aIt consists of laying the entire vine in the earth, and then %0asplitting the stock asunder by means of wedges ; the fibrous %0aportions are then trained out in as many furrows, care being %0ataken to support each of the slender plants by fastening it to %0aa stake, and not to cut away the branches that shoot from the %0asides. The growers of Novara, not content with the mul- %0atitude of shoots that run from tree to tree, nor yet with an %0aabundance of branches, encourage the stock-branches to en- %0atwine around forks planted in the ground for the purpose ; a %0amethod, however, which, in addition to the internal defects %0aarising from the soil, imparts a harshness to the wine. %0a%0aThere is another fault, too, that is committed by the people %0aof Varracina," near Eome — they only prune their vines every %0aother year ; not, indeed, because it is advantageous to the tree, %0abut from a fear lest, from the low prices fetched by their wines, %0athe expense might exceed the profits. At Carseoli they adopt %0aa middle course, by pruning away only the rotten parts of %0athe vine, as well as those which are beginning to wither, and %0aleaving the rest to bear finiit, after thus clearing away all %0asuperfluous incumbrances. The only nutriment they give %0ait is this exemption from frequent pruning ; but unless the %0asoil should happen to be a very rich one, the vine, under such %0a%0aIt is no longer used, and Fee doubts its utility. %0aHardouin suggests " Tarracina." %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 37.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE DISEASES OF TREES. %0a%0a%0a%0a517 %0a%0a%0a%0aa method of cultivatiou, will very soon degenerate to a wild %0astate. %0a%0aThe vine that is thus trained requires the ground to be %0aploughed very deep, though such is not the case for the so^-ing %0athere of grain. It is not customary to cut away the leaves %0ain this case, which, of course, is so much labour spared. %0aThe trees themselves require pruning at the same period %0aas the vine, and are thinned by clearing away all useless %0abranches, and such parts as would only absorb the nutriment. %0aWe have already «8 stated that the parts that are lopped should %0anever look north or south : and it will be better still, if they %0ahave not a western aspect. The wounds thus made are very %0asusceptible for a considerable time, and heal with the greatest %0adifficulty, if exposed to excesses of cold or heat. The vine %0awhen trained on a tree enjoys advantages that arc not pos- %0asessed by the others ; for the latter have certain fixed aspects, %0awhile in the former, it is easy to cover up the wounds made %0ain pruning, or to turn them whichever way you please.

Trees, we find, are attacked by maladies ; %0aand, indeed, what created thing is there that is exempt from %0athese evils ? Still however, the affections of the forest trees, %0ait is said, are not attended with danger to them, and the %0aonly damage they receive is from hail-storms while they are %0abudding and blossoming ; with the exception, indeed, of being %0anipped cither by heat or cold blasts in unseasonable weather ; %0afor frost, when it comes at the proper times, as we have akeady %0astated,™ is serviceable to them. " Well but," it will be said, %0a" is not the vine sometimes killed with cold ?" No doubt it is, %0aand this it is through which we detect inherent faults in the %0asoils, for it is only in a cold soil that the vine will die. Just in %0athe same way, too, in winter we approve of cold, so long aa %0ait is the cold of the weather, and not of the ground. It is not %0athe weakest trees, too, that are endangered in winter by frost, %0abut the larger ones. When they are thus attacked, it is the %0asummit that dries away the fii'st, from the circumstance that %0athe sap becomes frozen before it is able to arrive there. %0a%0aSome diseases of trees are common to them all, while %0aothers, again, arc peculiar to individual kinds- Worms are %0acommon to them all, and so, too, is sideration,'^ with pains in %0athe limbs," which are productive of debility in the various %0aparts. Thus do we apply the names of the maladies that pre- %0avail among mankind to those with which the plants are %0aafflicted. In the same way, too, we speak of their bodies being %0amutilated, the eyes of the buds being burnt up, with many %0aother expressions of a similar nature.

These worms even have now begun to be looked %0aupon as delicacies by epicures, and the large ones found in %0athe robur are held in high esteem ; they are known to us by %0athe name of " cossis;" and are even fed with meal, in order %0ato fatten them !

"When the approach of spriug %0atempts the still tender slioots to make their appearance, and %0athey venture to burst forth, the malady attacks them, and %0ascorches up the eyes of the buds, filled as they are with %0atheir milky juices : this is what upon flowers they call " char- %0acoal"*' blight. The consequences of hoar-frost to plants arc %0aeven more dangerous still, for when it has once settled, it %0aremains there in a frozen form, and there is never any wind to %0aremove it, seeing that it never prevails except in weather that %0ais perfectly calm and serene. Sideration, however, properly %0aso called, is a certain heat and dryness that prevails at the %0arising of the^® Dog-star, and owing to which grafts and young %0atrees pine away and die, the fig and the vine more particu- %0alarly. The olive, also, besides the worm, to which it is equally %0asubject with the fig, is attacked by the measles,*'' or as some %0athink fit to call it, the fungus or platter ; it is a sort of blast %0aproduced by the heat of the sun.

Either®^ the virulence of the disease manifests itself in %0athe feet, or, what is the same thing, the roots of the tree, or %0aelse in the joints of the fingers, or, in other words, the extre- %0amities of the branches that are most distant from the trunk. %0aThe parts that are thus affected become dry and shrivel up : %0athe Greeks have appropriate names®^ by which to distinguish %0a%0a*5 The effects produced upon young shoots by frost, are still so called. %0a%0aProbably from the black colour which it turns. %0a*8 In this case it would be very similar to what we call sun-stroke. %0a** "Clavum," a nail.

In either case the first symptoms are %0athat tfie tree is suffering from pain, and the parts affected be- %0acome emaciated and brittle ; then foUows rapid consumption %0aand ultimately death ; the juices being no longer able to enter %0athe diseased parts, or, at all events, not circulating in them. %0a%0a•fi -^^ ^^^^ particularly liable to this disease : but the %0awild fig IS exempt from all that we have hitherto mentioned. %0aScab^' IS produced by viscous dews which fall after the rising %0aof the Vcrgiliae ; but if they happen to fall copiously, they %0adrench the tree, without making the bark rough. When the %0afig is thus attacked, the fruit falls off while green ; and so, too, %0aif there is too much rain. The fig suffers also from a super- %0afluity of moisture in the roots. %0a%0aIn addition to worms and sideration, the vine is subject to %0aa peculiar disease of its own, which attacks it in the joints, %0aand is produced from one of the three following causes : — %0acither the destruction of the buds by stormy weather, or else %0athe fact, as remarked by Theophrastus, that the tree, when %0apruned, has been cut with the incisions upwards,"" or has been %0ainjured from want of skill in the cultivator. All the injury %0athat is inflicted in these various ways is felt by the tree in the %0ajoints more particularly. It must be considered also as a %0aspecies of sideration, when the cold dews make the blossoms %0afall off, and when the grapes harden"' before they have attained %0atheir proper size. Vines also become sickly when they are %0aperished with cold, and the eyes are frost-bitten just after they %0ahave been pruned. Heat, too, out of season, is productive of %0asimilar results : for everything is regulated according to a fixed %0aorder and certain determinate movements. Some maladies, %0atoo, originate in errors committed by the vine-dresscr ; when %0athey are tied too tight, for instance, as already mentioned,"^ or %0aAvhen in trenching round them the digger has struck them an %0aunlucky blow, or when in ploughing about them the roots have %0abeen strained through carelessness, or the bark lias been %0astripped from off the trunk : sometimes, too, contusions are %0aproduced by the use of too blunt a pruning-knife.

The %0aapple, however, is the most delicate of them all, and more %0aparticularly the one that bears the sweetest fruit. In some %0atrees weakness induced by disease is productive of barrenness, %0aand does not kill the tree ; as in the pine"'* for instance, or the %0apalm, when the top of the tree has been removed ; for in such %0acase the tree becomes barren, but docs not die. Sometimes, too, %0athe fruit itself is sicldy, independently of the tree ; for example, %0awhen there is a deficiency of rain, or of warmth, or of wind, %0aat the periods at which they usually prevail, or when, on the %0aother hand, they have prevailed in excess ; for in such cases the %0afruit will either drop off or else deteriorate. But the worst %0athing of all that can befall the vine or the olive, is to be pelted %0awith hea\'7 showers just when the tree is shedding its blossom, %0afor then the fruit is sure to fall off' as well. %0a%0aliain, too, is productive of the caterpillar, a noxious insect %0athat eats away the leaves, and, some of them, the blossoms as %0awell ; and this in the olive even, as we find the case at Miletus ; %0agiving to the half-eaten tree a most loathsome appearance. This %0apest is produced by the prevalence of a damp, languid heat ; %0aand if the sun should happen to shine after this with a more %0aintense heat and burn them up, this pest only gives place to %0aanother- just as bad, the aspect only of the evil being changed. %0a%0aThere is still one other affection that is peculiar to the olive %0aand the vine, known as the "cobweb,"^ the fruit being en- %0aveloped in a web, as it were, and so stifled. There are certain %0awinds, too, that are particularly blighting to the olive and the %0avine, as also to other fruits as well : and then besides, the fruits %0athemselves, independently of the tree, are very much worm- %0aeaten in some years, the apple, pear, medlar, and pomegranate %0afor instance.

The prevalence %0aof showers after the rising of Arcturus^ prevents them from %0abreeding ; but if the rains are accompanied with wind from %0athe south, they will make their appearance in the ripe fruit %0aeven, which are then very apt to fall. This nappcns more %0aparticularly in moist, watery localities ; and even if they do %0anot fall, the olives that are so aflectcd are good for nothing. %0aThere is a kind of flj^ also that is very troublesome to some %0afruit, acorns and figs for instance : it would appear that they %0abreed from the juices* secreted beneath the bark, which at %0athis period are sweet. These trees, too, are generally in a %0adiseased state when this happens. %0a%0aThere are certain teraporaiy and local influences which cause %0ainstantaneous death to trees, but which cannot properly be %0atermed diseases ; such, for example, as consumption, blast, or %0athe noxious effects of some winds that are peculiar to certain %0alocalities ; of this last nature are the Atabulus® that prevails %0ain Apulia, and the Olyrapias'' of Euboea. This wind, if it %0ahappens to blow about the winter solstice, nips the tree with %0acold, and shrivels it up to such a degree that no warmth of the %0asun can ever revive it. Trees that are planted iu valleys, and %0aare situate near the banks of rivers, are especially liable to %0athese accidents, the vine more particularly, the olive, and the %0afig. When this has been the case, it may instantly be detected %0athe moment the period for germination arrives, though, in the %0aolive, somewhat later. With all of these trees, if the leaves %0afall off, it is a sign that they will recover ; but if such is not %0athe case, just when you would suppose that they have escaped %0auninjured, they die. Sometimes, however, the leaves will %0abecome green again, after being dry and shrivelled. Other %0atrees, again, in the northern regions, Pontus and Phrygia, for %0aexample, suffer greatly from cold or frost, in case they should %0acontinue for forty days after the winter solstice. In these %0acountries, too, as well as in other parts, if a sharp frost or co- %0apious rains should happen to come on immediately after fruc- %0atification, the fruit is killed in a very few days even. %0a%0a* See B. xviii. c. 74. ,,,-•,%3c. %0a» On the contrary, this sweet juice is secreted b)' the insect itself, an %0aaphis or vine-fretter. %0a« The north-west wind.

Thus, for instance, jjitch, oil, and grease,** if aj)- %0aplied to trees, and young ones more particularly, arc higlily %0adetrimental. Tlicy may be killed, also, by removing a circular %0apiece of the bark from around them, with the exception, in- %0adeed, of the cork-tree,' which is rather benefitted than other- %0awise by the operation ; for the bark as it gradually thickens %0atends to stifle and sufibcate the tree : the andrachle,"* too, re- %0aceives no injury from it, if care is taken not to cut the bodj' %0aof the tree. In addition to this, the cherry, the lime, and the %0avine shed their bark not that portion of it, indeed, which is %0aessential to life, and grows next the trunk, but the part that %0ais thrown off", in proportion as the other grows beneath. In %0asome trees the bark is naturally full of fissures, the plane for %0ainstance : in the linden it will all but grow again when re- %0amoved. Hence, in those trees the bark of which admits of %0acicatrization, a mixture of clay and dung''^ is employed by way %0aof remedy ; and sometimes with success, in case excessive cold %0aor heat does not immediately supervene. In some trees, again, %0aby the adoption of these methods death is only retarded, the %0arobur and the quercus," for example. The season of the year %0ahas also its peculiar influences ; thus, if the bark is removed %0afrom the fir and the pine, while the sun is passing through %0aTaurus or Gemini, the period of their germination, they will %0ainstantly die, while in winter they are able to withstand the %0ainjurious eff'ects of it much longer : the same is the case, too, %0awith the holm-oak, the robur, and the quercus. In the trees %0aabove mentioned, if it is only a narrow circular strip of bark %0athat is removed, no injurious eff'ects will be perceptible ; but %0ain the case of the weaker trees, as well as those which grow in %0aa thin soil, the same operation, if pex'formed even on one side %0aonly, will be sure to kill them. The removal of the top,'* in %0a%0a^ He probably means if applied to the bark of young trees. %0a%0a' The cork-tree forms no exception to the rule — if a complete ring of %0athe bark that lies under the epidermis is removed, the death of the tree is %0athe inevitable result. See B. xvi. c. 13. %0a%0aProbably the Arbutus integrifolia. See B. xiii. c. 40. %0a%0a1"' This in reality is not the bark, but merely the epidermis, which is %0acapable of reproduction in many trees. 12 See c. 16 of this Book. %0a%0a'3 This method, however, is often found efficacious in preserving the life %0aof the oak, as well as many other trees, by excluding the action of the %0aair and water. %0a%0a1* It prevents them from increasing in height, but does not cause their %0adeath. %0a%0a%0a%0aChup. 37.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTUE DISEASES OF TEEE3. %0a%0a%0a%0a525 %0a%0a%0a%0athe pitch-tree, the cedar, and the cj-press is productive of a %0asimilar result ; for if it is either cut off or destroyed by fire, %0athe tree will not survive : the same is the case, too, if they %0aare bitten by the teeth of animals. %0a%0aVarro^' informs us, too, as we have already stated," that the %0aohve, if only licked by a she-goat, will be barren.*' When %0athus injured, some trees will die, while in others the fruit be- %0acomes deteriorated, the almond,^^ for instance, the fruit of Avhich %0achanges from sweet to bitter. In other cases, again, the tree is %0aimproved even — such, for instance, as the pear known in Chios %0aas the Phocian pear.

(25.) — PRODIGIES CONNECTED WITH TREES. %0a%0aAmong the maladies which affect the various trees, we may %0afind room for portentous prodigies also. For we find some %0atrees that have never had a leaf upon them ; a vine and a pome- %0agranate bearing-^ fruit adhering to the trunk, and not upon %0athe shoots or branches ; a vine, too, that bore grapes but had %0ano leaves ; and olives that have lost their leaves while the frnit %0aremained upon the tree. There are some marvels also connected %0awith trees that are owing to accident ; an olive that was com- %0apletely burnt, has been known to revive, and in I3ccotia, some %0afig-trees that had been quite eaten away by locusts budded %0aafresh.^*' Trees, too, sometimes change their colour, and turn %0afrom black to white ; this, however, must not always be looked %0aupon as portentous, and more particularly in the case of those %0awhich are grown from seed; the white poplar, too, often becomes %0ablack. Some persons are of opinion also that the service-tree, %0aif transplanted to a warmer locality, will become barren, liut %0ait is a prodig)-, no doubt, when sweet fruits become sour, or %0asour fruits sweet ; and when the wild fig becomes changed %0ainto the cultivated one, or vice versa. It is sadly portentous,''' %0atoo, when the tree becomes deteriorated by the change, the %0acultivated olive changing into the wild, and the white grape %0aor fig becoming black : such was the case, also, when upon the %0aarrival of Xerxes there, a plane-tree at Laodicea was trans- %0a%0a26 See B. xix. c. 26. 27 yirgii shared this belief: see Georg. ii. 1. 299. %0a%0a^ This may be true in some measure as to. nitre, alum, and warm sea- %0awater ; but not so as to the shells of beans and pigeon-pease, which would %0amake an excellent manure for it. %0a%0a*^ This, as Fee remarks, is not by any means impossible, nor, indeed, %0aare any other of the cases mentioned in this paragraph, owin? to some %0aaccidental circumstance. ggg £ xxix. c. 29 %0a%0a31 These stories can, of course, be only regarded as fabulous. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 38.] PU0DIGIE3 CONNECTED WITH TIIEES. 527 %0a%0aformed into an olive. In such narratives as these, the book %0awritten in Greek by Aristander abounds, not to enter any fur- %0ather on so extended a subject ; and we have in Latin the Com- %0amentaries of C. Epidius, in which we find it stated that trees %0ahave even been known to speak. In the territory of Cumaj, a tree, %0aand a very ominous presage it was, sank into the earth shortly %0abefore the civil wars of Porapeius Magnus began, leaving only %0aa tew of the branches protruding from the ground. The Sibyl- %0aline Books were accordingly consulted, and it was found that %0aa war of extermination was impending, which would be at- %0atended with greater carnage the nearer it should approach the %0acity of Home. %0a%0aAnother kind of prodigy, too, is the springing up of a tree %0ain some extraordinary and unusual place, the head of a statue, %0afor instance, or an altar, or upon another tree even.^- A fig- %0atree shot forth from a laurel at Cyzicus, just before the siege %0aof that city ; and so in like manner, at Tralles, a palm issued %0afrom the pedestal of the statue of the Dictator Cajsar, at the %0aperiod of his civil wars. So, too, at Rome, in the Capitol %0athere, in the time of the wars against Perseus, a palm-tree %0agrew from the head of the statue of Jupiter, a presage of im- %0apending victory and trium])hs. This palm, however, having %0abeen destroyed by a tempest, a fig-tree sprang up in the very %0asame place, at the period of the lustration made by the censors %0aM. Messala and C. Cassius,^^ a time at which, according to Piso, %0aan author of high authority, all sense of shame had been utterly %0abanished. Above all the prodigies, however, that have ever %0abeen heard of, Ave ought to place the one that was seen in our %0aown time, at the period of the fall of the Emperor Nero, in the %0aterritory of Marrucinum ; a plantation of olives, belonging to %0aVectius Marcellus, one of the principal members of the Eques- %0atrian order, bodily crossed the public highway, while the fields %0athat lay on the opposite side of the road passed over to supply %0athe place which had been thus vacated by the olive-yard.*^ %0a%0aCHAP. 39.

Some of these remedies may be applied to %0aall kinds of trees in common, while others, again, are peculiar %0ato some only. The methods that are common to them all, are, %0abaring the roots, or moulding them up, thus admitting the air %0aor keeping it away, as the case may be ; giving them water, or %0adepriving them of it, refreshing them with the nutritious juices %0aof manure, and lightening them of their burdens by pruning. %0aThe operation, too, of bleeding," as it were, is performed upon %0athem by withdrawing their juices, and the bark is scraped all %0around^-' to improve them. In the \T.ne, the stock branches are %0asometimes lengthened out, and at other times repressed ; the %0abuds too are smoothed, and in a measure polished up, in case %0athe cold weather has made them rough and scaly. These re- %0amedies are better suited to some kinds of trees and less so to %0aothers : thus the cypress, for instance, has a dislike to water, %0aand manifests an aversion to manure, spading round it, pruning, %0aand, indeed, remedial operations of every kind ; nay, what is %0amore, it is killed by irrigation, while, on the other hand, the %0avine and the pomegranate receive their principal nutriment %0afrom it. In the fig, again, the tree is nourished by w^atering, %0awhile the very same thing Avill make the fruit pine and die : %0athe almond, too, if the ground is spaded about it, will lose its %0ablossom. In the same way, too, there must be no digging %0aabout the roots of trees when newly grafted, or indeed until %0asuch time as they are sufficiently strong to bear. Many %0atrees require that all superfluous burdens should bo pruned %0aaway from them, just as we ourselves cut the nails and hair. %0aOld trees are often cut down to the ground, and then shoot up %0aagain from one of the suckers ; this, however, is not the case %0awith all of them, but only those, the nature of which, as we %0ahave already stated/^ will admit of it. %0a%0aCHAP. 40.

Care should be %0ataken, too, to proportion it to the age of the tree, young trees %0abeing not so thirsty as older ones ; those too which require the %0amost water, are the ones that have been the most used to it. %0aUn the other hand, plants which grow in a dry soil, require no %0amore moisture than is absolutely necessary to their existence. %0a%0aCHAP. 41, EEMABKABLE FACTS CONNECTED Willi IKKIGATION. %0a%0aIn the Fabian district, which belongs to the territory of %0aSulrao'*'* in Italy, where they are in the habit, also, of irrigating %0athe fields, the natural harshness of the wines makes it neces- %0asary to water the vineyards ; it is a very singular thing, too, %0athat the water there kills all the weeds, while at the same %0atime it nourishes the corn, thus acting in place of the wecding- %0ahook. In the same district, too, at the winter solstice, and %0amore particularly w hen the snow is on the ground or frosts %0aprevail, tliey irrigate the laud, a process which they call %0a" warming " the soil.

The bitter almond will become sweet, if, %0aafter spading round the trunk and cleaning it, the lowermost %0apart of it is pierced all round, so that the humours may have %0aa passage for escape and ensure being removed. In the elm, %0atoo, the superfluous juices are drawn off, by piercing the tree %0aabove ground to the pith when it is old, or when it is found %0ato suft'er from an excess of nutriment. So, too, when the bark %0aof the fig is turgid and swollen, the confined juices are dis- %0acharged by means of light incisions made in a slanting direc- %0ation ; by the adoption of which method the fruit is prevented %0afrom falling off. When fruit-trees bud but bear no fruit, a %0afissure is made in the root, and a stone inserted ; the result of %0awhich is, that they become productive." The same is done %0aalso with the almond, a wedge of robur being employed for %0athe pui-pose. For the pear and the service tree a M^edgc of %0atorch-wood is used, and then covered over with ashes and earth. %0aIt is even found of use, too, to make circular incisions around %0athe roots of the vine and fig, when the vegetation is too luxu- %0ariant, and then to throw ashes over 'the roots. A late crop of %0afigs is ensured, if the first fruit is taken off when green and %0alittle larger than a bean ; for it is immediately succeeded by %0afresh, which ripens at a later period than usual. If the tops of %0aeach branch are removed from the fig, just as it is beginning %0ato put forth leaves, its strength and productiveness are greatly %0aincreased. As to caprification, the effect of that is to ripen the %0afruit. %0a%0aCHAP. 44. — CAPRIFICATION, AKD PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH %0aTHE FIG. %0a%0aIt is beyond all doubt that in caprification the green fruit %0agives birth to a kind of gnat for when they have taken %0a%0a" He alludes to the medical operation for the removal of carious bones %0adescribed by Celsus, B. viii. c. 3.

Indeed, these insects are so eager to take %0atheir flight, tliat they mostly leave behind them cither a leg %0aor a part of a wing on their departure. There is another %0aspecies of gnat,^« too, that grows in the fig, which in its indo- %0alence and malignity strongly resembles the drone of the bee- %0ahive, and shows itself a deadly enemy to the one that is of %0areal utility ; it is called centrina, and in killing the others %0ait meets its own death. %0a%0aMoths, too, attack the seeds of the fig : the best plan of getting %0arid of them, is to bury a slip of mastich," turned upside down, in %0athe same trench. The fig, too, is rendered extremely productive*" %0aby soaking red earth in amurca, and laying it, with some ma- %0anure, upon the roots of the tree, just as it is beginning to %0athrow out leaves. Among the wild figs, the black ones, and %0athose which grow in rocky places, are the most esteemed, from %0athe fact of the fruit containing the most seed. Caprification %0atakes place most advantageously just after rain. %0a%0aCHAP. 45. EKEOES THAT MAY BE COMMITTED IN PErNIITG, %0a%0aBut, before everything, especial care should be taken that %0aintended remedies are not productive of ill results ; as these %0amay arise from either remedial measures being applied in ex- %0acess or at unseasonable times. Clearing away the branches is %0aof the greatest benefit to trees, but to slaughter*" them this %0away every year, is productive of the very worst results. The %0avine is the only tree that requires lopping every year, the %0araj-rtle, the pomegranate, and olive every other ; the reason %0abeing that these trees shoot with great rapidity. The other %0atrees are lopped less frequently, and none of them in autumn ; %0athe trunk even is never scraped,^^ except in spring. In prun- %0aing a tree, all that is removed beyond Avhat is absolutely neces- %0asary, is so much withdrawn from its vitality. %0a%0aCHAP. 46.

The same is the case, too,witli the refuse of the cur- %0arier's workshop, unless it is well diluted with water : manure %0awill scorch also, if laid on land too plentifully. It is generally %0aconsidered the proper proportion, to use three modii to every ten %0afeet square ; this, however, the nature of the soil must decide. %0a%0aCHAP. 47. — MEDICAMENTS FOE TREES. %0a%0aWounds and incisions of trees are treated also with pigeon %0adung and swine manure. If pomegranates are acid, the ruots %0aof the tree are cleared, and swine's dung is applied to them : %0athe result is, that in the first year the fruit will have a vinous %0aflavour, but in the succeeding one it will be sweet. Some %0a])ersons are of opinion that the pomegranate should be watered %0afour times a year with a mixture of human urine and watiT, %0aat the rate of an amphora to each tree ; or else that the ex- %0atremities of the branches should be sprinkled with silphium" %0aBteeped in wine. The stalk of the pomegranate should be %0atwisted, if it is found to split while on the tree. The fig, too, %0ashould be drenched with the amurca of olives, and other trees %0awhen they are ailing, with lees of wine ; or else lupines may %0abe sown about the roots. The water, too, of a decoction of %0alupines is beneficial to the fruit, if poured upon the roots of %0athe tree.

The best plan, too, with the cherry, %0aas with all other kinds, is to thin the fruit, so that that which %0ais left behind may grow all the larger. %0a%0a(28.) There are some trees, again, which thrive all the better %0afor being maltreated,'* or else are stimulated by pungent sub- %0astances ; the palm and the mastich for instance, which derive %0anutriment from salt water.^ Ashes have the same virtues as %0a%0aAgriculturists, Fee says, are not agreed upon this question. %0a%0aOr laser.

In addition to %0athis, in the case of the olive and the fig, he recommends that %0aa layer of straw should be first placed around them. In the %0afig, too, more particularly, he says that in spring the roots %0ashould be well moulded up ; the result of which is, that the %0afruit will not tall off while green, and the tree will be all the %0amore productive, and not affected with roughness of the bark. %0a%0aWithout any efficacy, beyond a doubt. %0a" The action of salt upon vegetation is, at the best, very uncertain. %0a%0aThese recipes are worthless, and almost inipnieticable. %0a%0aThis method is still adopted, but with none of the accessories here %0amentioned by Pliny. . . j ^ j %0a%0a«" A dano-crous practice, Fee remarks, and certainly not to be adopted. %0a6' Mitior" Re llust. 93. %0a%0a%0a%0a534 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural HISTOHY.

Some persons are content to make a fumigation %0awith this mixture while the wind is blowing towards the vine, %0afor three days in succession. %0a%0aMany persons, again, attribute no less utility and nutritious %0avirtue to urine than Cuto does to amurca ; only they add to %0ait an equal proportion of water, it being injurious if employed %0aby itself. Some give the name of " volucre"*^ to an insect %0awhich eats away the young grapes : to prevent this, they rub %0athe pruning-knife, cxory time it is sharpened, upon a beaver- %0askin, and then prune the tree with it: it is recommended also, %0atliat after the pruning, the knife should be well rubbed with %0athe blood of a bear.*' Ants, too, are a great pest to trees ; %0athey are kept away, however, by smearing the trunk with red %0atarth and tar : if a fish, too, is hung up in the vicinity of the %0atree, these insects will collect in that one spot. Another %0amethod, again, is to pound lupines in oil,"® and anoint the %0aroots with the mixture. Many people kill both ants as well %0aas moles with amurca, and preserve apples from caterpillars %0aas well as from rotting, by touching the top of the tree with %0athe gall of a green lizard. %0a%0aAnother method, too, of preventing caterpillars, is to make %0aa woman,™ with her monthly courses on her, go round each %0atree, barefooted and ungirt.

Crassus and Cneius Domitius Aheno- %0a%3c barbus. Crassus was one of the most celebrated of the Eoman %0a%3c orators ; his house was remarkable for its magnificence, though %0a%3c in some measure surpassed even by that of Q. Catulus,* %0a%3c also upon the Palatine Hill ; the same Catulus, who, in con- %0a%3c jimction with C. Marius, defeated the Cimbri. But by far %0a%3c the finest house of all that period, it was universally acknow- %0a%3c ledged, was that of C. Aquilius, a Roman of Equestrian rank, %0a%3c situate upon the Viminal Hill ; a house, indeed, that conferred %0a%3c a greater degree of celebrity upon him than even his acquaint- %0a%3c ance with the civil law. This, however, did not prevent %0a%3c Crassus being reproached with the magnificence of his.

Crassus, a man who united to singular presence %0a%3c of mind great readiness of wit, made answer that, deducting %0a%3c six trees only, he would accept the offer; upon \vhieh Domi- %0a%3c tius replied, that upon those terms he would not give so much %0a%3c as a single denarius for the purchase. " Well then, Domi- %0a%3c tius," was the rejoinder of Crassus, " which of the two is it %0a%3c that sets a bad example, and deserves the reproof of the cen- %0a%3c sorship ; I, who live like a plain man in a house that has %0a%3c come to me by inheritance, or you, who estimate six trees %0a%3c at a value of ten millions of sesterces ?" ^ These trees were %0a%3c of the lotus' kind, and by the exuberance of their branches %0a%3c afforded a most delightful shade. Cajcina Largus, one of the %0a%3c grandees of Home, and the owner of the house, used often to %0a%3c point them out to me in my younger days ; and, as I have al- %0a%3c ready made mention* of the remarkable longevity of trees, I %0a%3c would here add, that they were in existence down to the pe- %0a%3c riod when the Emperor Nero set fire to the City, one hundred %0a%3c and eighty years after the time of Crassus ; being still green %0a%3c and with all tlie freshness of youth upon them, had not that %0a%3c prince thought fit to hasten the death of the very trees even. %0a%3c %0a%3c Let no one, however, imagine that the house of Crassus was %0a%3c of no value in other respects, or that, from the rebuke of Domi- %0a%3c tius, there was nothing about it worthy cf remark with the %0a%3c exception of these trees.

Of such recent date is the luxury and opulence which %0a%3c Ave now enjoy, and so much greater was the value which in %0a%3c those days trees were supposed to confer upon a property ! %0a%3c A pretty good proof of which, was the fact th:it Doniitius even, %0a%3c with all his enmity, would not keep to the offer he had made, %0a%3c if the trees were not to be included in the bargain. %0a%3c %0a%3c The trees have furnished surnames also to the ancients,'" such, %0a%3c for instance, as that of Fronditius to the warrior who swam %0a%3c across the Volturnus with a wreath of leaves on his head, and %0a%3c distinguished himself by his famous exploits in the war against %0a%3c Hannibal ; and that of Stolo^^ to the Licinian family, such being %0a%3c the name given by us to the useless suckers that shoot from %0a%3c trees ; the best method of clearing away these shoots was %0a%3c discovered by the first Stolo, and hence his name. The ancient %0a%3c laws also took the trees under their protection ; and by the %0a%3c Twelve Tables it was enacted, that he who should wrongfully %0a%3c cut down trees belonging to another person, should pay twenty- %0a%3c five asses for each. Is it possible then to imagine that they, %0a%3c who estimated the fruit-trees at so low a rate as this, could ever %0a%3c have supposed that so exorbitant a value would be put upon the %0a%3c lotus as that which I have just mentioned ? And no less mar- %0a%3c vellous, too, are the changes that have taken place in the value %0a%3c of fruit ; for at the present day we fi.nd the fruit alone of many %0a%3c of the trees in the suburbs valued at no less a sum than two %0a%3c thousand sesterces ; the profits derived from a single tree thus %0a%3c being more tlian those of a whole estate in former times. It %0a%3c was from motives of gain that the grafting of trees and the %0a%3c propagation thereby of a spurious ofispring was first devised, %0a%3c so that the growth of the fruits even might be a thing inter- %0a%3c dicted to the poor. We shall, therefore, now proceed to %0a%3c state in what way it is that such vast revenues are derived %0a%3c from these trees, and with that object shall set forth the true %0a%3c and most approved methods of cultivation ; not taking any %0a%3c notice of the more common methods, or those which we find %0a%3c generally adopted, but considering only those points of doubt %0a%3c and uncertainty, in relation to which practical men are most %0a%3c apt to find themselves at a loss : while, at the same time, to %0a%3c %0a%3c As Fee remarks, this usage has been reversed in modern times, and %0a%3c plants often receive their botanical names from men. %0a%3c 1' See B. xviii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] THE INFLUENCE OF WEATUEE ON THEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c affect any scrupulous exactness in cases where there is no %0a%3c necessity tor it, will be no part of our purpose. In the first %0a%3c place, however, we will consider in a general point of view %0a%3c those inlluences of soil as well as weather which are exercised %0a%3c upon all the trees in common. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 2. (2.) THE INFLUENCE OP WEATHEK UPON THE TKICES : %0a%3c %0a%3c WHAT IS THE PROPER SITUATION FOR THE VINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Trees are fond of a site more particularly that faces the %0a%3c north-east the breezes rendering their foliage more thick and %0a%3c exuberant, and imparting additional solidity to the wood. This %0a%3c is a point, however, upon which most people are very greatly %0a%3c deceived ; thus in vineyards, for instance, the props ought not %0a%3c to be placed in such a position as to shelter the stems from the %0a%3c wind in that quarter, it being only against the northern blasts %0a%3c that this precaution should be taken. Nay, even more than this %0a%3c — if the cold weather only comes on in due season, it contributes %0a%3c very materiallj^ to the strengthening of the trees, and promotes %0a%3c the process of germination ; while, on the other hand, if at that %0a%3c period the southern breezes should caress them, they will grow %0a%3c weak and languid, and more i)articularly so, if the blossom is %0a%3c just coming on. If rainy weather, too, should happen to %0a%3c follow close upon blossoming, the total destruction of the fruit %0a%3c is the necessary result : indeed, if the weather should be only %0a%3c cloudy, or south winds happen to prevail, it is quite sufficient %0a%3c to ensure the loss of the fruit in the almond and the pear.'* %0a%3c Rains, if prevalent about the rising of the Vergiliae,"' are most %0a%3c injurious to the vine and the olive, as it is at that season that %0a%3c germination*' is commencing with them ; indeed, this is a most %0a%3c %0a%3c '2 Or north north-east, as Fee says. He adds that this aspect in re- %0a%3c ality is not favourable to vegetation. Pliny commits the error of copying %0a%3c exactly from Theophrastus, and thereby giving advice to Roman agricul- %0a%3c turists, which was properly suited to the clinnite of Greece only. %0a%3c %0a%3c '3 This is borrowed from Theophrastus ; but, as Fee remarks, if suitable %0a%3c to the climate of Greece, it is not so to that of Italy or France, where %0a%3c vegetation is much more promoted by a south wind. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 This assertion, Fee says, is erroneous.

The cereals, too, ripen more unfavourably %0a%3c when south winds prevail, though at the same time it pro- %0a%3c ceeds with greater rapidity. All cold, too, is injurious to ve- %0a%3c getation, which comes with the northern winds, or out of the %0a%3c proper season. It is most advantageous to all plants for %0a%3c north-east winds" to prevail throughout the Avinter. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this season, too, showers are very necessary, and the rea- %0a%3c son is self-evident — the trees, being exhausted by the fruit %0a%3c they have borne, and weakened by the loss of their leaves, are, %0a%3c of course, famished and hungry; and it is the showers that %0a%3c constitute their aliment. Experience has led us to believe %0a%3c that there is nothing more detrimental than a warm winter ; %0a%3c for it allows the trees, the moment they have parted with %0a%3c their fruits, to conceive again, or, in other words, to germinate, %0a%3c and then exhaust themselves by blossoming afresh. And %0a%3c what is even worse than this, should there be several years of %0a%3c such weather in succession, even the trees themselves will die ; %0a%3c for there can be little doubt that the effort must of necessity %0a%3c be injurious, when they put forth their strength, and are at %0a%3c the same time deprived of their natural sustenance. The poet^" %0a%3c then, who has said that serene winters are to be desired, cer- %0a%3c tainly did not express those wishes in favour of the trees. %0a%3c And no more docs rain, if prevalent at the summer-solstice, %0a%3c conduce to the benefit^' of the vine : while, at the same time, %0a%3c to say that a dusty winter produces a luxuriant harvest, is cer- %0a%3c tainly the mistake of a too fertile imagination. It is a thing %0a%3c greatly to be wished, too, both in behalf of the trees as well as %0a%3c the cereals, that the snows should lie for a considerable time %0a%3c upon the ground ; the reason being that they check the escape %0a%3c of the spirit of the earth by evaporation, and tend to throw it %0a%3c %0a%3c '8 See B. xvi. c. 46. %0a%3c %0a%3c " From Theophrastus, De Cansis, B. ii. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c "^^ He alludes to the words of Virgil, Georg. i. 100 : — %0a%3c %0a%3c "Huraida solstitia, atque liienies orate serenas, %0a%3c Agricolae; hibemo laetissima pulvere farra." %0a%3c Fee remarks, that the cultivators of the modern times are more of the %0a%3c opinion of the poet tlian the naturalist. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because rains would cause the young fruit to fall off.

Hence it is that the moisture %0a%3c of snow does not drench and engulph everj-thing all at once, %0a%3c but gradually trickles downwards, in proportion to the thirst of %0a%3c the plant, nurturing it as though from the breast, instead of %0a%3c producing an inundation. The earth, too, ferments under this %0a%3c influence, and becomes filled with her own emanations : not %0a%3c exhausted by the seeds in her bosom, swollen as they are with %0a%3c milk,"-' she smiles in the warm and balmy hours, when the time %0a%3c comes for opening it. It is in this way, more particularly, %0a%3c that com fattens apace, except, indeed, in those climates in %0a%3c which the atmosphere is always warm, Egypt for example ; for %0a%3c there the continuance of the same temperature and the force of %0a%3c habit are productive of the same effects as the modifications of %0a%3c temperature in other countries. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the same time it is equally necessary in every climate %0a%3c that there should be no noxious influence in existence. Thus, %0a%3c for instance, in the greater part of the world, that precocious %0a%3c germination which has been encouraged by the indulgent tempe- %0a%3c rature of the weather, is sure to be nipped by the intense colds %0a%3c that ensue. Hence it is that late winters are so injurious, %0a%3c and such they prove to the trees of the forest even ; indeed, %0a%3c these last are more particularly exposed to the ill effects of a %0a%3c late winter, oppressed as they are by the density of their %0a%3c foliage, and human agency being unable to succour them ; for %0a%3c it would be quite impossible to cover^^ the more tender forest %0a%3c trees with wisps of straw. Eains, then, are favourable to %0a%3c vegetation — first of all, during the winter season, and next, %0a%3c just previously to germination ; the third period for them being %0a%3c that of the formation of the fruit, though not immediately, %0a%3c and only, in fact, when the produce of the tree shows itself %0a%3c strong and healthy. %0a%3c %0a%3c " " Lactescentibus." Fee remarks on the appropriateness of this expres- %0a%3c sion, as the act of germination, he says, in the cereals and all the seeds in %0a%3c which the perisperm is feculent, changes the fecula into an emulsive %0a%3c liquid, in which state the seed may be said, with Pliny, to be %0a%3c "lactescent." %0a%3c %0a%3c Which appears to have been extensively done with the young garden %0a%3c %0a%3c trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 441 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natural uistouy. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Those trees which are the slo-n'est in bringing their fruits to %0a%3c maturity, and require a more prolonged supply of nutriment, %0a%3c receive benefit also from late rains, such as the vino, the olive, %0a%3c and the pomegranate, for instance. These rains, however, ai-e %0a%3c required at different seasons by the different trees, some of %0a%3c them coming to maturity at one period and some at another ; %0a%3c hence it is that we see the very same rain productive of injury %0a%3c to some trees and beneficial to others, even when they are of the %0a%3c very same species, as in the pear for instance : for the winter %0a%3c pear stands in need of rain at one period, and the early pear at %0a%3c another, though at the same time they, all of them, require it %0a%3c in an equal degree. "Winter precedes the period of germina- %0a%3c tion, and it is this fact that makes the north-east wind more %0a%3c beneficial than the south, and renders the parts that lie in the %0a%3c interior preferable to those near the coast, — the former being %0a%3c generally the coldest, — mountainous districts better than level %0a%3c ones, and rain at night better than showers in the day. Vege- %0a%3c tation, too, receives a greater degree of benefit from the water %0a%3c Avhen the sun. does not immediately soak it up. %0a%3c %0a%3c Connected, too, with this subject is the question of the best %0a%3c situation for planting vines, and the trees which support them. %0a%3c VirgiP* condemns a western aspect, while there are some persons, %0a%3c again, who prefer it to an easterly one : I find, however, that %0a%3c most authors approve of the south, though I do not think that %0a%3c any abstract precepts-^ can be given in relation to the point. %0a%3c The most careful attention on the part of the cultivator ought %0a%3c to be paid to the nature of the soil, the character of the loca- %0a%3c lity, and the respective influences of climate. The method ot %0a%3c giving to the vine a southern aspect, as practised in Africa and %0a%3c * * * jg injurious to the tree, as well as unhealthy for %0a%3c the cultivator, from the very circumstance that tlie country %0a%3c itself lies under a southern meridian : hence it is, that he who %0a%3c selects for his plants tliere a western or a northerly aspect, will %0a%3c combine on the most advantageous terms the benefits of soil %0a%3c with those of climate. When Yirgil condemns a western aspect, %0a%3c there can be no doubt that he includes in his censure a northern %0a%3c aspect as well : and yet, in Cisalpine Italy, where most of the %0a%3c vineyards have an aspect to the north, it lias been foirnd by %0a%3c experience that there are none that are more prolific. %0a%3c %0a%3c Georg. ii. 398. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 Taken altogether, a southern aspect is preferable to all othcis. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 2.] IIIK INiTLUKNCE OF WEATHER OX TliEES. 445 %0a%3c %0a%3c The winds are also a very important consideration. In the %0a%3c provinces of Gallia Narbonensis, and in Liguria and part of %0a%3c Etruna, it is considered a proof of great want of skill to plant %0a%3c the vine on a site that lies in the teeth of the wind Circius ^ %0a%3c while, on the other hand, it is a mark of prudence to catch %0a%3c Its breezes in an oblique direction ; it is this wind, in fact, %0a%3c that modihes the heat in those countries, though at the same %0a%3c time it is usually so violent, as to sweep away the roofs of %0a%3c the houses. %0a%3c %0a%3c (3.) There are some persons who employ a method of making %0a%3c the question of weather dependent upon the nature of the soil ; %0a%3c thus in the case of a vineyard, for instance, in a dry locality, %0a%3c they give it an eastern or a northern aspect ; but where it "is %0a%3c planted on a humid site, it is made to face the south. From %0a%3c the varieties of the vine also, they borrow various modifica- %0a%3c tions in reference to site ; taking care to plant the early vine %0a%3c in a cold locality, in order that the fruit may ripen before the %0a%3c frosts come on ; while such fruit trees and vines as have an anti- %0a%3c pathy to dews are exposed to the east, that the sun may carry %0a%3c off their humidity at the earliest moment. On the other hand, %0a%3c such as manifest a partiality to dews are planted with a western %0a%3c or even a northern aspect, to give them an opportunity of en- %0a%3c joying them all the longer. Others, again, borrowing their %0a%3c notions pretty nearly from Nature, have recommended that %0a%3c vines and trees should be planted facing the north-east ; indeed %0a%3c Dcmocritus is of opinion, that by so doing the fruit will %0a%3c be all the more odoriferous. %0a%3c %0a%3c (4.) We have already spoken, in the Second Book,^' of the %0a%3c points of the north-east and other winds, and shall have occa- %0a%3c sion in the succeeding one to make mention of several more of %0a%3c the heavenly pha^nomena. In the mean time, however, we %0a%3c Diay observe that it would appear to be a manifest proof of the %0a%3c salubrity of a north-east site, that the leaves are always the %0a%3c first to tall in the trees that have an aspect toAvards the south.-* %0a%3c A similar reason exists, too, in the maritime districts; in %0a%3c certain localities the sea breezes are detrimental, though in %0a%3c most they are nutritious. For some plants, again, it is pleasant %0a%3c to behold the sea at a distance, while at the same time they %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See B. ii. c. 46.

We %0a%3c have already mentioned-^ the plants that thrive in the shade, %0a%3c and in the cold even ; but in all these matters experience will %0a%3c be found the best of guides. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. WHAT SOILS AKE TO BE CONSIDEEED THE BEST. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next after the influences of the heavens, we have to treat of %0a%3c those of the earth, a task that is in no way more easy than the %0a%3c previous one. It is but rarely that the same soil is found %0a%3c suited to trees as well as corn : indeed, the black ^° earth which %0a%3c prevails in Campania is not everywhere found suited to the vine, %0a%3c nor yet that which emits light exhalations, or the red^' soil %0a%3c that has been so highly praised by many. The cretaceous earth %0a%3c that is found in the territory of Alba Pompeia, and an argil- %0a%3c laceous soil, are preferred to all others for the vine, although, %0a%3c too, they are remarkably rich, a quality that is generally looked %0a%3c upon as not suited to that plant. On the other hand, again, %0a%3c the white sand of the district of Ticinura, the black saud of %0a%3c many other places, and the red sand as Avell, even though mixed %0a%3c with a rich earth, will prove unproductive. %0a%3c %0a%3c The very signs, also, from which we form our judgment are %0a%3c often very deceptive ; a soil that is adorned with tall and %0a%3c graceful trees is not always a favourable one, except, of course, %0a%3c for those trees. What tree, in fact, is there that is taller than %0a%3c the fir ? and yet what other plant could possibly exist in the %0a%3c same spot ? Nor ought we always to look upon verdant pas- %0a%3c tures as so many proofs of richness of soil ; for what is there %0a%3c that enjoys a greater renown than the pastures of Germany? %0a%3c and yet they consist of nothing but a very thin layer of turf, %0a%3c with sand immediately beneath. Nor yet is the soil which %0a%3c produces herbage of large growth always to be looked upon as %0a%3c liumid; no, by Hercules ! no more than a soil is to be looked %0a%3c upon as unctuous and rich, which adheres to the fingers — a %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 B. xvi. cc. 30, 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 A rich black mould, probably. %0a%3c A ferruginous argilla. %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 It must of necussity denote a soil ricli in humus, tbougli not, of %0a%3c course, adapted for all kiuds of cultivation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■WnAT SOILS AKE BEST. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 447 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c thipg that IS proved m the case of the argillaceous earths.^ %0a%3c The earth who'd thrown back into the hole from which it has %0a%3c just been dug will never=^ fill it, so that it is quite impossible %0a%3c by that method to form any opinion as to its density or thin- %0a%3c ness. It IS the fact, too, that every ^* soil, without exception, %0a%3c will cover iron with rust. Nor yet can we determine^* the %0a%3c heaviness or lightness of soils in relation to any fixed and as- %0a%3c certained weight: for what are we to understand as the %0a%3c standard weight of earth ? A soil, too, that is formed from %0a%3c the alluvion of rivers is not always to be recommended, for %0a%3c there are some crops that decay all the sooner in a watery soil ; %0a%3c indeed, those soils even of this description which are highly %0a%3c esteemed, are never found to be long good for any kind of %0a%3c vegetation but the willow. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among other proofs of the goodness of soil, is the comparative %0a%3c thickness of the stem in corn. In Laborium, a famous cham- %0a%3c paign country of Campania, the stalk is of such remarkable %0a%3c thickness, that it may be used even to supply the place of %0a%3c wood and yet this very soil, from the difficulty that is every- %0a%3c where experienced in cultivating it, and the labour required %0a%3c in working it, may be almost said to give the husbandman %0a%3c more trouble by its good qualities than it could possibly have %0a%3c done by reason of any defects.

In the vicinity %0a%3c of Larissa, in Thessaly, a lake was drained and the conse- %0a%3c quence was, that the district became much colder, and the %0a%3c olive-trees which had formerly borne fruit now ceased to bear. %0a%3c When a channel was cut for the Hebrus, near the town of %0a%3c ^nos, the place was sensible of its nearer approach, in finding %0a%3c its vines frost-bitten, a thing that had never happened before ; %0a%3c in the vicinity, too, of Philippi, the country having been %0a%3c drained for cultivation, the nature of the climate became en- %0a%3c tirely altered. In the territory of Syracuse, a husbandman, %0a%3c who was a stranger to the place, cleared the soil of all the %0a%3c stones, and the consequence was, that he lost his crops from %0a%3c the accumulation of mud ; so that at last he was obliged to %0a%3c carry the stones back again. In Syria again, the plough- %0a%3c %0a%3c •wliat similar in nature to marl, and that though unproductive by itself, it %0a%3c is beneficial when mixed with vegetable earth.

At Chalcia,*" an %0a%3c island belonging to the Ehodians, there is a certain place which %0a%3c is so remarkably fertile, that after reaping the barley that has %0a%3c been sown at the ordinary time, and gathering it in, they im- %0a%3c mediately sow a fresh crop, and reap it at the same time as the %0a%3c other corn.

So, too, on the other hand, the eye can distinguish a %0a%3c soil that is mixed with ashes or with white sand, Avhile earth %0a%3c that is sterile and dense may be easily detected by its peculiar %0a%3c hardness, at even a single stroke of the mattock. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato,^* briefly and in his peculiar manner, characterizes the %0a%3c defects that exist in the various soils. " Take care," he says, %0a%3c " where the earth is rotten not to shake it either with carts or %0a%3c by driving cattle over it." Now what are we to suppose that %0a%3c this term " rotten" means, as applied to a soil, about which %0a%3c he is so vastly apprehensive as to almost forbid our setting %0a%3c foot upon it ? Let us only form a comparison by thinking %0a%3c what it is that constitutes rottenness in wood, and we shall %0a%3c find that the faults which are held by him in such aversion are %0a%3c the being arid, full of holes, rough, white, mouldy, worm- %0a%3c eaten, in fact, just like pumice-stone ; and thus has Cato said %0a%3c more in a single word than we could have possibly found %0a%3c means to express in a description, however long. Indeed, if %0a%3c we could find means of expressing the various defects that %0a%3c exist in soils, we should find that there are some of them that %0a%3c are old, not with age (for age cannot'^ be concerned in relation %0a%3c to the earth), but of their own nature, and are hence unfruit- %0a%3c ful and powerless for every purpose from the first. The same %0a%3c writer, too, considers that as the very best of soils, which, %0a%3c situate at the foot of a declivity, runs out into a champaign %0a%3c country, taking a southward direction ; -such, in fact, being %0a%3c the aspect of the whole of Italy he says** also, that the earth %0a%3c generally known as black earth is of a tender nature, and %0a%3c is consequently the most easily worked and the best for cereals. %0a%3c If we only appreciate with due care the signification of this %0a%3c word "tender,"^" we shall find that it expresses its intended %0a%3c meaning remarkably well, and that in this word is comprised %0a%3c every quality that is desirable for the purposes of cultivation. %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 De Re Rust. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c 55 This he says in reference to his belief, with Epicurus, in the eternity %0a%3c of matter. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ De Re Rust. 1.

Earth %0a%3c of this nature will shine again after the plough-share has %0a%3c passed through it, just as Homer," that great fountain-head of %0a%3c all genius, has described it sculptured by the Divinity^^ upon %0a%3c the arms [of Achilles], adding, too, a thing that is truly marvel- %0a%3c lous, that It was of a blackish hue, though gold was the mate- %0a%3c rial in which it was wrought. This, too, is that kind of earth, %0a%3c which, when newly turned up, attracts the ravenous birds that %0a%3c follow the plough-share, the ravens even going so far as to peck %0a%3c at the heels of the ploughman. %0a%3c %0a%3c We may in this place appropriately make mention of an %0a%3c opinion that has been pronounced by an Italian writer also %0a%3c with reference to a matter of luxury. Cicero, that other %0a%3c luminary of literature, has made the following remark : " Those %0a%3c unguents which have a taste of earth" are better," says he, %0a%3c "than those which smack of saffron;" it seeming to him %0a%3c more to the purpose to express himself by the word " taste"''* %0a%3c than "smell." And such is the fact, no doubt; that soil %0a%3c is the best which has the flavour of a perfume."^ If the %0a%3c question should be put to us, what is this odour of the earth %0a%3c that is held in such estimation, our answer is, that it is the %0a%3c same that is often to be recognized at the moment of sunset, %0a%3c without the necessity even of turning up the ground, at the %0a%3c spots where the extremities of the rainbow" have been ob- %0a%3c served to meet the earth ; as also when, after long-continuecl %0a%3c drought, the rain has soaked the ground. Then it is that the %0a%3c earth exhales this di^-ine odour, that is so peculiarly its own, %0a%3c and to which, imparted to it by the sun, there is no perfume, %0a%3c however sweet, that can possibly be compared. It is this %0a%3c odour that the earth, when turned up, ought to emit, and %0a%3c which, when once found, can never deceive a person ; and %0a%3c this will be found the best criterion for judging of the quality %0a%3c of the soil.

In other %0a%3c kinds of soil the work of cultivation depends entirely upon the %0a%3c weather ; as, for instance, in those which cannot be ploughed %0a%3c just after rain, because the natui'al exuberance of the earth %0a%3c renders it viscous and cloggy. On the other hand, in Byza- %0a%3c cium, a district of Africa, and a champaign country of such %0a%3c singular fertility as to render grain one hundred and fifty fold," %0a%3c the soil is such, that in time of drought, not even bulls are %0a%3c able to plough it; while, on another occasion, just after a shower %0a%3c of rain, one poor ass, with an old woman to guide it, is quite %0a%3c sufficient," as ourselves we have witnessed, to do the plough- %0a%3c ing.

It has also one of these two peculiar- %0a%3c ities, it is either rough or greasy to the touch ; the proper %0a%3c mode of testing it being by the hand. Its uses, too, are of a %0a%3c twofold nature — it is employed for the production of the %0a%3c cereals only, or else for the enrichment of pasture land as %0a%3c well.

Of the marls that are found to be of an unctuous na- %0a%3c ture, the best is the white. There are several varieties of it : %0a%3c the most pungent and biting being the one already mentioned. %0a%3c Another kind is the white chalk that is used for cleaning %0a%3c silver ; it is taken from a considerable depth in the ground, %0a%3c the pits being sunk, in most instances, as much as one hundred %0a%3c feet. These pits are narrow at the mouth, but the shafts en- %0a%3c large very considerably in the interior, as is the case in mines; %0a%3c it is in Britain more particularly that this chalk is employed. %0a%3c The good efiects of it are found to last fall eighty years ; and %0a%3c there is no instance known of an agriculturist laying it twice %0a%3c on the same land during his life.*' A third variety of white %0a%3c marl is known as glisomarga f- it consists of fullers' chalk ^ %0a%3c mixed with an unctuous earth, and is better for promoting the %0a%3c growth of hay than grain ; so much so, in fact, that between %0a%3c harvest and the ensuing seed-time there is cut a most abundant %0a%3c crop of grass.

The ^dui and the Pictones have rendered %0a%3c their lands remarkably fertile by the aid of limestone, which %0a%3c is also found to be particularly beneficial to the olive and the %0a%3c vine.*' Every marl, however, requires to be laid on the land %0a%3c immediately after ploughing, in order that the soil may at %0a%3c once imbibe its properties ; while at the same time, it requires %0a%3c a little manure as well, as it is apt, at first, to be of too acrid %0a%3c K nature, at least where it is not pasture land that it is laid %0a%3c upon; in addition to which, by its very freshness it may pos- %0a%3c sibly injure the soil, whatever the nature of it may be; so %0a%3c much so, indeed, that the land is never fertile the first year %0a%3c after it has been employed. It is a matter of consideration %0a%3c also for what kind of soil the marl is required ; if the soil is %0a%3c moist, a dry marl is best suited for it ; and if dry, a rich %0a%3c unctuous marl.

They do not, how- %0a%3c ever, use them indiscriminately upon the same soil, nor do %0a%3c they employ ashes for promoting the growth of shrubs, nor, in %0a%3c fact, of some of the cereals, as we shall have occasion'" to %0a%3c mention hereafter. There are some persons who are of opinion %0a%3c also that dust'^ imparts nutriment to grapes, and cover tliem %0a%3c with it while they are growing, taking care to throw it also %0a%3c upon the roots of the vines and other trees. It is well %0a%3c known that this is done in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, %0a%3c and it is a fact even better ascertained that the grape ripens %0a%3c all the sooner for it ; indeed, the dust there contributes more %0a%3c to its ripeness than the heat of the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c CUAV. 6. MAOTEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are various kinds of manure, the use of which is of %0a%3c very ancient date. In the times of Homer"- even, the aged %0a%3c king is represented as thus enriching the land by the labour of %0a%3c his own hands. Tradition reports that King Augeas was the %0a%3c first in Greece to make use of it, and that Hercules introduced %0a%3c the practice into Italy ; which country has, however, immor- %0a%3c talized the name of its king, Stercutus,'^ the son of Faunus, %0a%3c as claiming the honour of this invention. M. Varro'* assigns %0a%3c the first rank for excellence to the dung of thrushes kept in %0a%3c aviaries, and lauds it as being not only good for land, but %0a%3c excellent food for oxen and swine as well ; indeed, he goes so %0a%3c far as to assert that there is no food that they will grow fat upon %0a%3c more speedily. We really have some reason to augur well of %0a%3c the manners of the present day, if it is true that in the days %0a%3c of our ancestors there were aviaries of such vast extent as to %0a%3c be able to furnish manure for the fields. %0a%3c %0a%3c Though ashes fertilize the ground, more particularly when of an ar- %0a%3c gillaceous nature, they are not so extensively used now as in ancient times. %0a%3c Pliny alludes here more particularly to wood and dunghill ashes. %0a%3c This, however, he omits to do. %0a%3c 8' He alludes, probably, to Theophrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 22. %0a%3c 52 Odyssey xxiv. 225. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 From "stcrcus," "dung."

Some authors, again, are agreed in re- %0a%3c garding the residue of the human food'' as the very best of %0a%3c all manures ; while others would only employ the superfluous %0a%3c portion of our drink,''* mixing with it the hair that is to be %0a%3c found in the curriers' workshops. Some, however, are for %0a%3c employing this liquid by itself, though tliey would mix water %0a%3c ■nith it once more, and in larger quantities even than when %0a%3c originally mixed with the wine at our repasts ; there being a %0a%3c double share of noxious qualities to correct, not only those %0a%3c originally belonging to the wine,"' but those imparted to it %0a%3c by the human body as well. Such are the various methods %0a%3c by which we vie with each other in imparting nutriment to %0a%3c the earth even. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next to the manures above mentioned, the dung of swine is %0a%3c highly esteemed, Columella being the only writer that con- %0a%3c demns it. Some, again, speak highly of the dung of all %0a%3c quadrupeds that have been fed on cytisus, while there are %0a%3c others who prefer that of pigeons. Next to these is the %0a%3c dung of goats, and then of sheep ; after which comes that of %0a%3c oxen, and, last of all, of the beasts of burden. Such were %0a%3c the distinctions that were established between the various ma- %0a%3c nures among the ancients, such the precepts that they have left %0a%3c us, and th(!se I have here set forth as being not the mere subtle %0a%3c inventions of genius, but because their utility has been proved %0a%3c in the course of a long series of years.

In the vicinity of Paris, a manure is employed called %0a%3c urate, of which urine forms the basis. , , , n f • %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee seems to think that this passage means that the bad smell of urine %0a%3c is imparted to it by the wine that is drunk. It is difficult to say what %0a%3c could have been the noxious qualities imparted by wine to unne as a ma- %0a%3c nure, and Pliny probably would have been somewhat at a loss to explain %0a%3c his meaning. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 458 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINt's NATTJRAL niSTOKT. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XYir. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c son of their prolific soil, we have seen the maniire passed %0a%3c through a sieve like so much flour, and perfectly devoid, %0a%3c through lapse of time,* of all bad smell or repulsive look, %0a%3c being changed in its appearance to something rather agreeable %0a%3c than otherwise. In more recent times it has been found that %0a%3c the olive thrives more particularly in soil that has been ma- %0a%3c nured with the ashes^ of the lime-kiln. To the ancient rules %0a%3c Varro^ has added, that corn land should be manured with horse- %0a%3c dung, that being the lightest manure of all, while meadow %0a%3c land, he says, thrives better with a manure of a more heavy %0a%3c nature, and supplied by beasts that have been fed upon barley ; %0a%3c this last tending more particularly to the better growth of %0a%3c grass.* Some persons, indeed, prefer the dung of the beasts %0a%3c of burden to that of oxen even, the manure of the sheep to %0a%3c that of the goat, and the manure of the ass to all others, the %0a%3c reason being that that animal masticates the most slowly of %0a%3c them all. Experience, however, has pronounced against these %0a%3c dicta of Varro and Columella ; but it is universally agreed by %0a%3c all writers that there is nothing more beneficial than to turn' %0a%3c up a crop of lupines, before they have podded, with either the %0a%3c plough or the fork, or else to cut them and bury them in %0a%3c heaps at the roots of trees and vines.

Indeed, the varieties of them are hardly less %0a%3c numerous than of those which are produced by Nature," so %0a%3c abundantly have we testified our gratitude in return for her %0a%3c numerous bounties. For these trees, we find, are reared either %0a%3c from seed, or else by transplanting, by layers, by slips torn from %0a%3c the stock, by cuttings, by grafting, or by cutting into the trunk %0a%3c of the tree. But as to the story that the leaves of the palm %0a%3c are planted by the Babj'lonians, and so give birth'^ to a tree, %0a%3c I am really surprised that Trogus should have ever believed %0a%3c it. Some of the trees are reproduced by several of the me- %0a%3c thods above enumerated, others, again, by all of them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10.

In modern times, the period for %0a%3c manuring varies, according to the usage of different localities, being prac- %0a%3c tised in aU the four seasons of the year, according to the crops, weather, %0a%3c and climate. " See B. xvi. c. 58. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tlie palm is grown in Africa from shoots tlirown out from the axillse %0a%3c of the leaves; and it is in this circumstance, Fee thinks, that the story told %0a%3c by Trogus must have originated. Some of the ferns throw out adventitious %0a%3c buds from the summit of the leaf, and the orange tree and some others %0a%3c occasionally have them at the base of the leaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11.] TEEES WHICH NEVEli DEGEKEEATE. 461 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c again in germination.

The medlar, too, can also be %0a%3c propagated by the agency of seed. All trees, however, that are %0a%3c grown by this method are very slow in coming to maturity,-' %0a%3c degenerate" very rapidly, and must often be renewed by graft- %0a%3c ing : indeed, the chesnut even sometimes requires to be grafted. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 11.

"We have already made mention^* of the various kinds %0a%3c of laurel ; those known as the Augustan, the baccalis, and the %0a%3c tinus'^^ are all reproduced in a similar manner. The berries %0a%3c are gathered in the month of January, after they have been %0a%3c dried by the north-east winds which then prevail : they are %0a%3c then kept^^ separate and exposed to the action of the air, being %0a%3c Uable to ferment if left in a heap.

A trench is then dug, about a palm in depth, %0a%3c and somewhere about twenty of the berries are then put into %0a%3c it, being laid in a heap : this is usually done in the month of %0a%3c March. These kinds of laurel admit of being propagated %0a%3c from layers also ; but the triumphaP' laurel can be reproduced %0a%3c from cuttings only. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the varieties of the myrtle^" are produced in Campania %0a%3c from the berry only, but at Rome from layers. Democritus, %0a%3c however, says that the Tarentine myrtle may be re-produced %0a%3c another way.^' They take the largest berries and pound them %0a%3c lightly so as not to crush the pips : with the paste that is thus %0a%3c made a rope is covered, and put lengthwise in the ground ; %0a%3c the result of which is that a hedge is formed as thick as a wall, %0a%3c with plenty of slips for transplanting. In the same way, too, %0a%3c they plant brambles to make a hedge, by first covering a rope %0a%3c of rushes with a paste made of bramble-berries.

PEOPAGATION BY SUCKERS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nature, too,^ has taught us the art of forming nurseries ; %0a%3c when from the roots of many of the trees we see shooting up a %0a%3c dense forest of suckers, an offspring that is destined to be %0a%3c killed by the mother that has borne them. For by the shade %0a%3c of the tree these suckers are indiscriminately stifled, as we %0a%3c often see the case in the laurel, the pomegranate, the plane, %0a%3c the cherry, and the plum. There are some few trees, the elm %0a%3c and the palm for instance, in which the branches spare the %0a%3c suckers ; however, they never make their appearance in any %0a%3c of the trees except those in which the roots, from their fond- %0a%3c ness for the sun and rain, keep close, as they range, to the %0a%3c surface of the ground. It is usual not to place all these suc- %0a%3c kers at once in the ground upon the spot wliich they are finally %0a%3c to occupy, but first to entrust them to the nursery, and to %0a%3c allow them to grow in seed-plots, after which they are finally %0a%3c transplanted.

PEOPAGATION BY SLIPS AND CUTXriTOS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nature has also discovered another method, which is very %0a%3c similar to the last — for slips torn away from the tree will live. %0a%3c In adopting this plan, care should be taken to pull out the %0a%3c haunch^' of the slip where it adheres to the stock, and so re- %0a%3c move with it a portion of the fibrous body of the parent tree. %0a%3c It is in this way that the pomegranate, the hazel, the apple, %0a%3c the sorb, the medlar, the ash, the fig, and more particularly %0a%3c the vine, are propagated. The quince, however, if planted in %0a%3c this way will degenerate,^** and it has been consequently found %0a%3c a better plan to cut slips and plant them : a method which %0a%3c was at first adopted for making hedges, with the elder, the %0a%3c quince, and the bramble, but came afterwards to be applied to %0a%3c cultivated trees, such as the poplar, the alder, and the willow, %0a%3c "which last wiU grow if even the slip is planted upside down.^* %0a%3c In the case of cuttings, they are planted at once in the spot %0a%3c ■which it is intended they should occupy : but before we pass %0a%3c on to the other methods of propagation, it seems as well to %0a%3c mention the care that should be expended upon making seed- %0a%3c plots.« %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 14. SEED-PLOTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In laying out a seed-plot it is necessary that a soil of the %0a%3c very highest quality should be selected ; for it is very often %0a%3c requisite that a nurse should be provided for the young plants, %0a%3c who is more ready to humour them than their parent soil. The %0a%3c ground should therefore be both dry and nutritious, well %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 " Pema." Tbis method of reproduction is still adopted, but it is not %0a%3c to be recommended, as the young tree, before it throws out a root, is liable %0a%3c to be overthrown by high winds. Virgil mentions it, Georg. ii. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c Palladius only says that the growth of the quince in such case is very %0a%3c %0a%3c slow. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2' This experiment has been tried for curiosity's sake, and has succeeded ; %0a%3c the roots become dry, lose their fibres, and then develop buds, from which %0a%3c branches issue ; while the buds of the summit become changed into roots. %0a%3c " Seminarii :" " nurseries," as they are more commonly called. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 14.] .SEED PLOTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 465 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c turned up with the mattock, replete with hospitality to the %0a%3c stranger plants and as nearly as possible resembling the soil to %0a%3c which It IS intended they should be transplanted.

He says that it is in this way tliat the %0a%3c seeds of the apple and the pear are reared, the pine-nut also, %0a%3c and the cypress," which is propagated from seed as well. In %0a%3c this last, the seed is remarkably^^ small, so much so, in fact, as %0a%3c to be scarcely perceptible. It is a marvellous fact, and one which %0a%3c ought not to be overlooked, that a tree should be produced %0a%3c from sources so minute, while the grains of wheat and of %0a%3c barley are so very much larger, not to mention the bean. %0a%3c What proportion, too, is there between the apple and the %0a%3c pear tree, and the seeds from which they take their rise ? It %0a%3c is from such beginnings, too, as these that springs the timber %0a%3c that is proof against the blows of the hatchet, presses^* that %0a%3c weights of enormous size even are unable to bend, masts that %0a%3c support the sails of ships, and battering-rams that are able to %0a%3c %0a%3c " The distance, in reality, ought to vary according to the nature and %0a%3c species of the trees, and the heiglit they are to be allowed to attain. %0a%3c « De Ec Eust. 48. %0a%3c %0a%3c *^ These precautions are not looked upon as necessary for the indigenous %0a%3c trees at the present day.

Such is the might, auch is the %0a%3c power that is displayed by Nature. But, a marvel that tran- %0a%3c scends all the rest, is the fact of a vegetable receiving its birth %0a%3c from a tear-like drop, as we shall have occasion to mention" in %0a%3c the appropriate place. %0a%3c %0a%3c To resume, however : the tiny balls which contain the seed %0a%3c i^e collected from the female cypress — for the male, as I have %0a%3c already''^ stated, is barren. This is done in the months which %0a%3c I have previously'*^ mentioned, and they are then dried in the %0a%3c sun, upon which they soon burst, and the seed drops out, %0a%3c a substance of which the ants are remarkably fond ; this fact, %0a%3c too, only serves to enhance the marvel, when we reflect that %0a%3c an insect so minute is able to destroy the first germ of a tree %0a%3c of such gigantic dimensions. The seed is sown in the month %0a%3c of April, the ground being first levelled with rollers, or else %0a%3c by means of rammers after which the seed is thickly sown, %0a%3c and earth is spread upon it with a sieve, about a thumb deep. %0a%3c If laid beneath a considerable weight, the seed is unable to %0a%3c spring up, and is consequently thrown back again into the %0a%3c earth ; for which reason it is often trodden only into the %0a%3c ground. It is then lightly watered after sunset every three %0a%3c days, that it may gradually imbibe the moisture until such %0a%3c time as it appears above ground.

From the nursery the young plants arc carried at the %0a%3c end of a year to the elm-plots, where they are planted at inter- %0a%3c vals of a foot each way. It is better to plant elms in autumn %0a%3c that are to support the vine, as they are destitute of seed %0a%3c and are only propagated from plants.

Where %0a%3c the earth is black, the depth should be two cubits and a palm, %0a%3c and the hole dug in a quadrangular Ibrm. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greek writers agree in pointing out much the same %0a%3c proportions, and are of opinion that the holes ought not to be %0a%3c more than two feet and a half in depth, or more than two feet %0a%3c wide : at the same time, too, they should never be less than %0a%3c a foot and a half in depth, even though the soil should be wet, %0a%3c and the vicinity of Avater preclude the possibility of the soil %0a%3c going any deeper. " If the soil is wateiy," says Cato,'^ " the %0a%3c hole should be three feet in width at the orifice, and one palm %0a%3c and a foot at the bottom, and the depth four feet. It should %0a%3c be paved, too, with stones,*' or, if they are not at hand, with %0a%3c stakes of green willow, or, if these cannot be procured, with a %0a%3c layer of twigs ; the depth of the layer so made being a foot %0a%3c and a half." %0a%3c %0a%3c It appears to me that I ought here to add, after what lias %0a%3c been said with reference to the nature of trees, that the holes %0a%3c should be sunk deeper for those which have a tendency to run %0a%3c near the surface of the earth, such as the ash and the olive, %0a%3c for instance. These trees, in fact, and others of a similar %0a%3c nature, should be planted at a depth of four feet, while for the %0a%3c others three feet will be quite sufficient.

THE INTEEVAIS TO BE LKFT BETWEEN TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The present seems to me to be tlie proper occasion for making %0a%3c some mention of the intervals®^ that ought to be left between %0a%3c the trees. Some persons have recommended that pomegra- %0a%3c nates, myrtles, and laurels should be planted closer together than %0a%3c the other trees, leaving, however, a space of nine feet between %0a%3c them. Apple-trees, they say, should be planted a little wider %0a%3c apart, and pear-trees, almonds, and figs even still more so. %0a%3c The best rule, however, is to consult the length of the branches, %0a%3c and the nature of the spot, as well as the shade that is formed %0a%3c by the tree ; for it is of great importance to take this last into %0a%3c consideration. The shadow thrown by the large trees even is %0a%3c but of sm-all dimensions, when the branches are disposed around %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 See B. xix. c. 30.

THE NATDUE OF THE SHADOW THROWU BY TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shadows of trees are possessed of certain properties. %0a%3c That of the walnut is banefuP^ and injurious to man, in whom %0a%3c it is productive of head-ache, and it is equally noxious to %0a%3c everything that grows in its vicinity. The shadow, too, of %0a%3c the pine has the effect of killing" the grass beneath it ; but %0a%3c in both of these trees the foliage presents an effectual resist- %0a%3c ance to the winds, while, at the same time, the vine is desti- %0a%3c tute of such protection."** The drops of water that fall from %0a%3c the pine, the quercus, and the holm-oak are extremely heavy, %0a%3c but from the cypress none fall ; the shadow, too, thrown by %0a%3c this last tree is extremely small, its foliage being densely %0a%3c packed.^' The shadow of the fig, although widely spread, is %0a%3c but light, for which reason it is allowed to be planted among %0a%3c vines. The shadow of the elm is refreshing and even nuiri- %0a%3c meutal to whatever it may happen to cover ; though, in the %0a%3c opinion of Atticus, this tree is one of the most injurious of %0a%3c them all ; and, indeed, I have no doubt that such may be the %0a%3c case when the branches are allowed to become too long ; %0a%3c but at the same time I am of opinion that when they are %0a%3c kept short it can be productive of no possible harm. The %0a%3c pUuie also gives a very pleasant shade, ^'^ though somewhat %0a%3c dense : but in this case we must look more to the luxuriant %0a%3c softness of the grass beneath it than the warmth of the sun ; %0a%3c for there is no tree that forms a more verdant couch on which %0a%3c to recline. %0a%3c %0a%3c The poplar" gives no shade Avhatever, in consequence of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 8" Sec B.

Declivities, taken bj'^ themselves, %0a%3c require smaller"^ intervals between the trees, and in localities %0a%3c that are exposed to the Avind it is beneficial to plant them %0a%3c closer together. However, it is the olive that requires the %0a%3c largest intervals to be left, and on this point it is the opinion %0a%3c of Cato,^' with reference to Italy, that the very smallest in- %0a%3c terval ought to be twenty- five feet, and the largest thirty : %0a%3c tins, however, varies according to the nature of the site. Tho %0a%3c olive is the largest'*^ of all the trees in Ba3tica : and in Africa %0a%3c — if, indeed, we maj^ believe the autliors who say so — there %0a%3c are many olive-trees that are known by the name of milliariaj,** %0a%3c %0a%3c ^- This is quite a fallacy. Even in the much more probable cases of %0a%3c the upas and mangineel, it is not the fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theopbrastus, De Causis, B. iii. c. 8, says, that trees that grow on %0a%3c declivities have shorter branches than those of the same kind growing on %0a%3c plains, ^^ De Re Ilust. c. 16. %0a%3c %0a%3c This assertion is doubtful ; at the present day, in Andalusia, the %0a%3c palm, the poplar, and many other trees are much larger than the olive. %0a%3c %0a%3c ■JG "Thousand pounders."

There is no doubt, %0a%3c however, that Baetica reaps the most prolific harvests from %0a%3c between her olives. %0a%3c %0a%3c It will be generally agreed that it is a most disgraceful %0a%3c piece of ignorance to lop away the branches more than is ab- %0a%3c solutely necessary in trees of vigorous growth, and so pi'eci- %0a%3c pitate old age ; as also, on the other hand, what is generally tan- %0a%3c tamount to an avowal of unskilfulness on the jiart of those %0a%3c who have planted them, to have to cut them down altogether. %0a%3c Nothing can reflect greater disgrace upon agriculturists than %0a%3c to have to undo what they have done, and it is therefore much %0a%3c the best to commit an error in leaving a superfluity of room. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CIIAI'. 20.

Hence %0a%3c it is, that a thing that is in itself most noxious and most %0a%3c baneful, has taught us the art of reproduction by layers and %0a%3c quicksets. The ivj*, too, has a similar property. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato ' says, that in addition to the vine, the fig, as well as %0a%3c the olive, the pomegranate, every variety of the apple, the %0a%3c laurel, the plum, the myrtle, the filbert, the nut of Proeneste, %0a%3c and the plane, are capable of being propagated by layers. %0a%3c %0a%3c Layers- are of two kinds ; in the one, a branch, while still %0a%3c adhering to the tree, is pressed downwards into a hole that %0a%3c measures four feet every way : at the end of two years it is %0a%3c cut at the part where it curves, and is then transplanted at %0a%3c the expiration of three years more. If it is intended to carry %0a%3c the plant to any distance, it is the best plan to place the layer, %0a%3c directly it is taken up, either in an osier basket or any earthen %0a%3c vessel, for its better security when carried. The other^ mode %0a%3c of reproduction by layers is a more costly one, and is efi'ected %0a%3c by summoning forth a root from the trunk of the tree even. %0a%3c For this purpose, earthen vessels or baskets are provided, and %0a%3c are then well packed with earth ; through these the extre- %0a%3c mities of the branches are passed, and by tliis mode of encou- %0a%3c ragement a root is obtained growing amid the fruit itself, and %0a%3c at the very summit of the tree ; for it is at the summit that %0a%3c this method is generally adopted. In this way has a bold and %0a%3c daring inventiveness produced a new tree aloft and far away %0a%3c from the ground. At the end of two years, in the manner %0a%3c already stated, the layer is cut asunder, and then planted in %0a%3c the ground, basket and all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The herb savin* is reproduced by layers, as also by slips ; it %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 Be Re Rust. c. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c * The French call cultivation by layers " marcotte," as applied to trees %0a%3c ill general ; and " provignage," as applicable to the vine.

We see a seed swallowed whole by a famished bird ; %0a%3c when softened by the natural heat of the crop, it is voided, %0a%3c with the fecundating juices of the dung, upon some soft couch %0a%3c formed by a tree ; or else, as is often the case, is carried by the %0a%3c winds to some cleft in the bark of a tree. Hence' it is that %0a%3c we see the cherry growing upon the willow, the plane upon %0a%3c the laurel, the laurel upon the cherry, and fruits of various %0a%3c tints and hues all springing from the same tree at once. It is %0a%3c said, too, that the jack-daw, from its concealment of the seeds %0a%3c of plants in holes which serve as its store-houses, gives rise to %0a%3c a similar result. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23. — rNOCIJLATION OR BUDDING. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this, too, the art of inoculating ^ took its rise. By the %0a%3c aid of an instrument similar to a shoe-maker's paring-knife %0a%3c an eye is opened in a tree by paring away the bark, and %0a%3c another bud is then enclosed in it, that has been previously re- %0a%3c moved with the same instrument from another tree. This was the %0a%3c ancient mode of inoculation with the fig and the apple. That %0a%3c again, described by Yirgil," requires a slight fissure to be %0a%3c made in the knot of a bud which has burst through the bark, %0a%3c and in this is enclosed a bud taken from another tree.

An %0a%3c improved method has, however, in more recent times, allowed %0a%3c of as many as six grafts being inserted, it being considered %0a%3c desirable by additional numbers to make a provision for the %0a%3c contingency of some of them not surviving. With this view, %0a%3c an incision is carefully made in the middle of the stock, a thin %0a%3c wedge being inserted to prevent the sides from closing, until %0a%3c the graft, the end of which is first cut to a point, has been let %0a%3c into the fissure. In doing this many precautions are neces- %0a%3c sary, and more particularly every care should be taken that %0a%3c the stock is that of a tree suitable for the purpose, and that %0a%3c the graft is taken from one that is proper for grafting.

On the other hand, the process of uniting is but slow %0a%3c where the dry is k>rought in contact with the moist, and the %0a%3c hard bark with the soft. %0a%3c %0a%3c _ The other points to be observed are the following : the inci- %0a%3c sion must not be made in a knot, as such an inhospitable rigidity %0a%3c will certainly repel the stranger plant ; the incision should be %0a%3c made, too, in the part which is most compact, and it must not %0a%3c be much more than three fingers in length, not in a slanting %0a%3c direction, nor yet such as to pierce the tree from side to side. %0a%3c Virgil'^ is cf opinion, that the grafts should not be taken from the %0a%3c top, and it is universally agreed that it is best to select them from %0a%3c the shoulders of the tree which look towards the north-east %0a%3c from a tree, too, that is a good bearer, and from a young shoot," %0a%3c unless, indeed, the graft is intended for an old tree, in which %0a%3c case it should be of a more robust growth. In addition to this, %0a%3c the graft ought to be in a state of impregnation, that is to say, %0a%3c swelling'' with buds, and giving every promise of bearing the %0a%3c same year ; it ought, too, to be two years old, and not thinner %0a%3c than the little finger. The graft is inserted at the smaller %0a%3c end, when it is the object of the grower that it should not %0a%3c grow to any considerable length, but spread out on either side. %0a%3c But it is more particularly necessary that the buds upon the %0a%3c graft should be smooth and regular, and there must be nothing %0a%3c Upon it at all scabbed or shrivelled. Success may be fully %0a%3c reckoned on if the pith of the graft is brought in contact with %0a%3c the wood and bark of the stock ; that being a much better plan %0a%3c than merely uniting them bark to bark.

The graft, however, must not be pointed %0a%3c while the wind is blowing, and care must be taken that the %0a%3c bark is not rubbed off from either graft or stock. The graft %0a%3c must be thrust into the stock up to the point where the bark %0a%3c begins ; care, too, must be taken not to wrench off the bark %0a%3c during the process of insertion, nor must it be thrust back so %0a%3c as to form any folds or wrinkles. It is for this reason that a %0a%3c graft should not be used that is too full of sap, no, by Hercules ! %0a%3c no more than one that is dry and parched ; for by doing so, in %0a%3c the former case, from the excess of moisture, the bark becomes %0a%3c detached, and in the latter, from want of vitality, it yields %0a%3c no secretions, and consequently will not incorporate with the %0a%3c stock. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a point most religiously" observed, to insert the graft %0a%3c during the moon's increase, and to be careful to push it down %0a%3c with both hands ; indeed, it is really the fact, that in this ope- %0a%3c ration, the two hands, acting at the same moment, are of neces- %0a%3c sity productive of a more modified and better regulated effoist %0a%3c Grafts that have been inserted with a vigorous effort are later %0a%3c in bearing, but last all the longer ; when inserted more ten- %0a%3c derly, the contrary is the result. The incision in the stock %0a%3c should not be too open or too large ; nor ought it to be too %0a%3c small, for in such case it would either force out the graft or %0a%3c else kill it by compression. But the most necessary precaution %0a%3c of all is to see that the graft is fairly inserted, and that it %0a%3c occupies exactly the middle of the fissure in the stock. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons are in the habit of making the place for the %0a%3c fissure in the stock with the knife, keeping the edges of the %0a%3c incision together with bands of osier bound tightly round %0a%3c the stock ; they then drive in the wedges, the bands keep- %0a%3c ing the stock from opening too wide.

If the stock used for grafting is of very con- %0a%3c siderable thickness, it is the best plan to insert the graft be- %0a%3c tween the bark and the wood; for which purpose a wedge %0a%3c made of bone is best, for fear lest when the bark is loosened %0a%3c the wood should be bruised. In the cherry, the bark is removed %0a%3c before the incision in the stock is made ; this, too, is the only %0a%3c tree that is grafted after the winter solstice. When the bark %0a%3c 18 removed, this tree presents a sort of downy substance, which, %0a%3c if it happens to adhere to the graft, will very speedily destroy %0a%3c It. When once the graft is safely lodged by the aid of the %0a%3c wedge, it is of advantage to drive it home. It is an excellent %0a%3c plan, too, to graft as near the ground as possible, if the con- %0a%3c formation of the trunk and knots will admit of it. The graft %0a%3c should not project from the stock more than six fingers in %0a%3c length. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato^" recommends a mixture of argiP' or powdered chalk, %0a%3c and cow-dung, to be stirred together till it is of a viscous consis- %0a%3c tency, and tlien inserted in the fissure and rubbed all round %0a%3c it. From his writings on the subject it is very evident that %0a%3c at that period it was the practice to engraft only between tlie %0a%3c wood and the bark, and in no other way; and that the graft %0a%3c was never inserted beyond a couple of fingers in depth. He %0a%3c recommends, too, that the pear and the apple sliould be grafted %0a%3c in spring, as also during fifty days at the time of the summer %0a%3c solstice, and during the time of vintage ; but tliat the olive %0a%3c and the fig should be grafted in spring only, in a thirsting, or %0a%3c in other words, a dry moon : he says also, that it should be %0a%3c done in the afternoon, and not while a south wind is blowing. %0a%3c It is a singular thing, that, not content with protecting the %0a%3c graft in tlie manner already mentioned, and with slieltcring %0a%3c it from showers and frosts by means of turfs and supple bands %0a%3c of split osiers, he recommends that it sliould be covered w^ith %0a%3c bugloss*^ as well — a kind of herb so called — which is to be %0a%3c tied over it and then covered up with straw. At the present %0a%3c day, however, it is thought sufficient to cover the bark with a %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 I)e Re Rust. 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2' This is the ongucnt Saint-Fiacre of the French, and is still used to %0a%3c protect the graft from all contact with the exterior air. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Altitudinem," as Dalechamps suggests, would appear to be a better %0a%3c reading than " latitudinem."

The pear %0a%3c may be grafted even when in blossom, so that with it the %0a%3c operation may be safely delayed to the month of May even. %0a%3c If grafts of fruit trees have to be carried to any distance, it %0a%3c is considered the best plan, with the view of preserving the %0a%3c juices, to insert them in a turnip; they may also be kept alive %0a%3c by placing them near a stream or a pond, between two hollow %0a%3c tiles covered up at each end with earth. (15.) The grafts of %0a%3c vines, however, are kept in dry holes, in which they are %0a%3c covered over with straw, and then with earth, care being taken %0a%3c to let the tops protrude.^* %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAr. 25. — GRAFTING THE TINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato^* speaks of three^' methods of grafting the vine. The %0a%3c first consists in piercing the stock to the pith, and then insert- %0a%3c ing the grafts, sharpened at the end, in manner already men- %0a%3c tioned, care being taken to bring the pith of the two in con- %0a%3c tact. The second is adopted in case the two vines are near %0a%3c one another, the sides of them both being cut in a slanting %0a%3c direction where they face each other ; after which the pith of %0a%3c the two trees is united by tying them togethor. In employ- %0a%3c ing the third method, the vine is pierced obliquely to the %0a%3c pith, and grafts are inserted a couple of feet in length ; they %0a%3c are then tied down and covered over with prepared earth, care %0a%3c being taken to keep them in an upright position. In our %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Borrowed from Columella, B. iv. c. 29.

Cure, too, is taken to select a %0a%3c graft that is just beginning to germinate, and not to leave %0a%3c more than a couple of the buds protruding from the stock. %0a%3c Tlio vine, too, should be carefully bound with wilhes of elft, %0a%3c incisions being made in it on either side, in order that the %0a%3c slimy juices may exude through them in preference, which %0a%3c are so particularly injurioiis to the vine. After this, when %0a%3c the graft has grown a couple of feet, the withe by v,'hich it is %0a%3c fastened should be cut, and the graft left to increase of its own %0a%3c natural vigour. %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper time^" for grafting the vine has been fixed as %0a%3c from the autumnal equinox to the beginning of the budding %0a%3c eeason. The cultivated plants arc generally grafted on the %0a%3c roots of wild ones, where tliese last are of a drier nature. ]^ut if %0a%3c a cultivated tree should be grafted on a wild one, it will very %0a%3c soon degenerate and become wild.'^* The rest depends entirely %0a%3c on the weather. Dry weather is the best suited for grafting; %0a%3c an excellent remedy for any evil effects that may possibly be %0a%3c caused by the drought, being a few pots of earth placed near %0a%3c the stock and filled with ashes; through which a little water %0a%3c is slowly filtered.

A similar %0a%3c piece of bark from another tree, with a protuberant bud upon %0a%3c it, is then inserted in its place, care being taken that the union %0a%3c is so exact that there is no room left for a cicatrix to form, and %0a%3c the juncture so perfect as to leave no access to either damp or %0a%3c air : still, however, it is always the best plan to protect the %0a%3c scutcheon by means of a plaster of clay and a band. Those who %0a%3c favour the modern fashions pretend that this method has been %0a%3c only discovered in recent times ; but the fact is, that we find %0a%3c it employed by the ancient Greeks, and described by Cato,^* %0a%3c who recommends it for the olive and the fig ; and he goes so %0a%3c far as to determine the very dimensions even, in accordance %0a%3c with his usual exactness. The scutcheon, he says, when taken %0a%3c off with the knife should be four^^ fingers in length, and three %0a%3c in breadth. It is then fitted to the spot which it is to occupy, %0a%3c and anointed with the mixture of his which has been pre- %0a%3c viously described.^* This method, too, he recommends for the %0a%3c apple. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons have adopted anotlier plan with the vine, %0a%3c which consists partly of that of grafting by scutcheon, and %0a%3c partly by fissure ; they first remove a square piece of bark %0a%3c from the stock, and then insert a slip in the place that is thus %0a%3c laid bare. I once saw at Thuliae,^^ near Tibur, a tree that hud %0a%3c been grafted upon all these various ways, and loaded with fruit %0a%3c of every kind. Upon one branch there were nuts to be seen, %0a%3c upon another berries, upon another grapes, upon another %0a%3c pears, upon another figs, and upon others pomegranates, and %0a%3c %0a%3c " "Scutula."

He thinks it %0a%3c possible, however, that a kind of mock grafting may have been produced %0a%3c in the case, still employed in some parts of Italy, and known as the %0a%3c " greffe-Diane." A trunk of an orange tree is split, and slips of numerous %0a%3c trees are than passed into it, wliich in time throw out their foliage and %0a%3c blossoms in various parts of the tree, or at the top ; the consequence of %0a%3c which is, that the stock appears to boar several varieties of blossoms at the %0a%3c same moment.

But, with all our experiments, we find %0a%3c it quite impossible to rival Nature ; for there are some %0a%3c plants that can be reproduced in no other manner than spon- %0a%3c taneously, and then only in wild and desert spots. The plane'" %0a%3c is generally considered the best adapted to receive every kind %0a%3c of graft, and next to it the robur; both of them, however, %0a%3c are very apt to spoil the flavour of the fruit. Some trees %0a%3c admit of grafting upon them in any fashion, the fig and the %0a%3c pomegranate for instance ; the vine, however, cannot be %0a%3c grafted upon by scutcheon, nor, indeed, any other of the trees %0a%3c which has a bark that is thin, weak, or cracked. So, too, %0a%3c those trees which are dry, or which contain but little moisture, %0a%3c will not admit of grafting by inoculation. This last method is %0a%3c the most prolific of them all, and next to it that by scutcheon, %0a%3c but neither of them can be depended upon, and this last more %0a%3c particularly ; for when the adherence of the bark is the only %0a%3c point of union the scutcheon is liable to be immediately dis- %0a%3c placed by the slightest gust of wind.

Corellius, a member of the Equestrian order at llome, %0a%3c and a native of Ateste, grafted a chesnut, in the territoij of %0a%3c Neapolis, with a slip taken from the same tree, and from tliis %0a%3c Avas produced the chesnut Avhich is so highly esteemed, and %0a%3c from him has derived its name.

Above ground, however, they should not be more %0a%3c than four fingers distant fi'om one another, and each of them %0a%3c must have a bud or eye above ground.

The following is the %0a%3c advice given by Cato" on the subject : "Eegin pruning your %0a%3c olive-yard fifteen days before the vernal ecjuinox ; from that %0a%3c period for forty days Avill be a good time for doing so. In %0a%3c pruning, adopt the following rules : when the ground is ex- %0a%3c tremely productive, remove all the dry branches or such as %0a%3c may have been broken by the wind ; where it is not so pro- %0a%3c lific, you must cut away still more, then tie them well up, %0a%3c and remove all tangled branches, so as to lighten the roots. %0a%3c In auturnn clear away the roots of the olive, and then manure %0a%3c them. The man who labours most assiduously and most %0a%3c earnestly will remove the very smallest fibres that are attached %0a%3c to the roots. If, however, he hoes negligently, the roots will %0a%3c soon appear again above ground, and become thicker than %0a%3c ever ; the consequence of which will be, that the vigour of the %0a%3c tree wall be expended in the roots." %0a%3c %0a%3c We have already stated, when speaking on the subject ot %0a%3c « De Re Eust. 44.

Mago recommends that the olive should %0a%3c be planted on declivities and in dry spots, in an argillaceous %0a%3c soil, and between autumn and the winter equinox. If, on the %0a%3c other bund, the soil is thick, humid, or somewhat damp even, %0a%3c it ought to be planted between harvest and the winter solstice ; %0a%3c advice, however, it should be remembered, applicable to Africa %0a%3c more particularly. At the present day, it is mostly the custom %0a%3c in Italy to plant the olive in spring, but if it is thought de- %0a%3c sirable to do so in the autumn as well, there are only four days %0a%3c in the forty between the equinox and the setting of the Vcr- %0a%3c giliae that are unfavourable for planting it.*' It is a practice %0a%3c peculiar to Africa, to engraft the olive on the wild olive only, %0a%3c a tree which is made to be everlasting, as it Avere ; for when it %0a%3c becomes old the best of the suckers are carefully trained for %0a%3c adoption by grafting, and in this way in another tree it %0a%3c grows young again ; an operation which may be repeated con- %0a%3c tinuously as often as needed ; so much so, indeed, that the %0a%3c same olive-yard will last for ages.*" The wild olive also is %0a%3c propagated both by insertion and inoculation. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is not advisable to plant the olive in a site where the %0a%3c quercus has been lately rooted up ; for the earth-worms, known %0a%3c as " raucae," which breed in the root of the quercus, are apt %0a%3c to get into that of the olive. It has been found, from practical %0a%3c experience, that it is not advisable to bury the cuttings in the %0a%3c ground nor yet to dry them before they are planted out. Ex- %0a%3c perience has also taught us that it is the best plan to clean an %0a%3c old olive-yard every other year, between the vernal equinox %0a%3c and the rising of the Vergiliae, and to lay moss about the roots ; %0a%3c to dig holes also round the trees every year, just after the %0a%3c summer solstice, two cubits wide by a foot in depth, and to %0a%3c manure them every third year, %0a%3c %0a%3c Mago, too, recommends that the almond should be planted %0a%3c between the setting of Arcturus" and the winter solstice.

The laurel should be planted between the %0a%3c setting ot the Eagle and that of the Arrow ; for we find that %0a%3c the proper time for planting is equally connected with the aspect %0a%3c of the heavenly bodies. For the most part it has been recom- %0a%3c mended that this should be done in spring and autumn ; but %0a%3c there is another appropriate period also, though known to but %0a%3c few, about the rising of the Dog-star, namely ; it is not, how- %0a%3c ever, equally advantageous in all localities. Still, I ought not %0a%3c to omit making mention of it, as I am not setting forth the %0a%3c peculiar advantages of any one country in particular, but am %0a%3c enquiring into the operations of Nature taken as a whole. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the region of Cyrenaica, the planting is generally done %0a%3c while the Etesian^* winds prevail, and the same is the case in %0a%3c Greece, and with the olive more particularly in Laconia. At %0a%3c this period, also, the vine is planted in the island of Cos ; and %0a%3c in the rest of Greece they do not neglect to inoculate and graft, %0a%3c though they do not*" plant, their trees just then. The natural %0a%3c qualities, too, of the respective localities, exercise a very consi- %0a%3c derable influence in this respect ; for in Egypt they plant in %0a%3c any month, as also in all other countries where summer rains %0a%3c do not prevail, India and .^Ethiopia, for instance. When trees %0a%3c are not planted in the spring they must be planted in autumn, %0a%3c as a matter of course. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three stated periods, then, for germination;" spring, %0a%3c the rising of the Dog-star, and that of Arcturus. And, indeed, %0a%3c it is not the animated beings only that are ardent for the pro- %0a%3c pagation of their species, for this desire is manifested in even %0a%3c a greater degree by the earth and all its vegetable productions ; %0a%3c to employ this tendency at the proper moment is the most %0a%3c %0a%3c «^ B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%3c %0a%3c " B. ii. c. 47, and B. xviii. c. 68. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ There is a contradiction here ; a few lines above, he says that they %0a%3c %3cfo plant their trees in Greece at this period.

Tliese %0a%3c moments, too, are of peculiar importance in relation to the %0a%3c process of grafting, as it is then that the two productions ma- %0a%3c nifest a mutual desire of uniting. Those who prefer the spring %0a%3c lor grafting commence operations immediately after the vernal %0a%3c equinox, reckoning on the fact that then the buds are just %0a%3c coming out, a thing that greatlj^ facilitates the union of the %0a%3c barks. On the other hand, those who prefer the autumn graft %0a%3c immediately after the rising of Arcturus, because then the graft %0a%3c at once takes root in some degree, and becomes seasoned for %0a%3c spring, so as not to exhaust its strength all at once in the pro- %0a%3c cess of germination. However, there are certain fixed periods %0a%3c of the j'ear, in all cases, for certain trees ; thus, the cherry, %0a%3c for instance, and the almond, are either planted or grafted about %0a%3c the winter solstice. Tor many trees the nature of the locality %0a%3c will be the best guide ; thus, where the soil is cold and moist %0a%3c it is best to plant in spring, and where it is dry and hot, in %0a%3c autumn. %0a%3c %0a%3c Taking Italy in general, the proper periods for these opera- %0a%3c tions may be thus distributed : — The mulberry is planted at %0a%3c any time between the ides of February*- and the vernal equi- %0a%3c nox ; the pear, in the autumn, but not bej^ond the fifteenth %0a%3c day before tlie winter solstice ; the summer apples, the quince, %0a%3c the sorb, and the plum, between mid-winter and the ides of %0a%3c February : the Greek carob*^ and the peach, at any time in %0a%3c autumn before the winter solstice ; the various nuts, such as %0a%3c the walnut, pine, filbert, almond, and chesnut, between the %0a%3c calends of March" and the ides of that month the willow %0a%3c and the broom about the calends of March.

This union between the two pa- %0a%3c rent trees is allowed to continue for three years, and then in %0a%3c the fourth the branch is cut away and left entirely upon the. %0a%3c tree that has so adopted it.

Holding the %0a%3c very first rank among these we find the willow, a tree that is %0a%3c always planted in a moist soil. The hole, however, should be %0a%3c two feet and a half in depth, and the slip a foot and a half %0a%3c only in length. Willow stakes are also used for the same %0a%3c purpose, and the stouter they are the better : the distance left %0a%3c between these last should be six feet. When they are thre* %0a%3c years old their growth is checked by cutting them down %0a%3c within a couple of feet from the ground, the object being to %0a%3c make them spread out, so that by the aid of their branches %0a%3c they may be cleared without the necessity of using a ladder ; %0a%3c for the willow is the more productive the nearer its branches %0a%3c are to the ground. It is generally recommended to trench %0a%3c round the willow every year, in the month of April. Such %0a%3c is the mode of cultivation employed for the osier willow.^' %0a%3c %0a%3c The stake wiUow^ is reproduced both from suckers and %0a%3c cuttings, in a trench of the same dimensions. Stakes may be %0a%3c cut from it at the end of about three years mostly.

A reed-bed will renew itself spontaneously %0a%3c after the old one has been rooted up, a circumstance which it %0a%3c has been found more beneficial to take advantage of than %0a%3c merely to thin them, as was formerly the practice ; the roots %0a%3c being in the habit of creeping and becoming interlaced, a %0a%3c thing that ends eventually in the destruction of the bed. The %0a%3c proper time for planting reeds is before the eyes begin to swell, %0a%3c or, in other words, before the calends of March.*' The reed %0a%3c continues to increase until the winter solstice., but ceases to do %0a%3c 80 when it begins to grow hard, a sign that it is tit lor cutting. %0a%3c It is generally thought, too, that the reed requhes to be %0a%3c trenched round as often as the vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reed also is planted in a horizontal position,^ and then %0a%3c covered with earth to a very great depth ; by this method as %0a%3c many plants spring up as there are eyes.

In addition to the above, they %0a%3c also grow other trees for cutting that we have already men- %0a%3c tioned — the ash for instance, the laurel, the peach, the hazel, %0a%3c and the apple ; but then they are of slower growth, and the %0a%3c stays made from them, when fixed in the ground, are hardly %0a%3c able to withstand the action of the earth, and much less any %0a%3c moisture. The elder, on the other hand, which affords stakes %0a%3c of the very stoutest quality, is grown from cuttings, like the %0a%3c poplar.

The in- %0a%3c tervals between these joints in the branches are short, and %0a%3c more particularly so towards the extremities. The pith, in %0a%3c itself the vivifying spirit of the tree, is always taking an %0a%3c onward direction, so long as the knot, by being open in the %0a%3c centre, allows it a free passage. If, however, the knot should %0a%3c become solidified and deny it a passage, the pith is then thrown %0a%3c downward upon the knot that lies next below it, and making %0a%3c its escape, issues forth there in the shape of a bud, these buds %0a%3c always making their appearance on each side alternately, as %0a%3c already mentioned in the case of the reed and the giant- %0a%3c fennel in other words, where one bud makes its appearance %0a%3c at the bottom of a knot to the right, the next one takes its place %0a%3c on the left, and so on alternately. In the vine this bud is known %0a%3c as the " gem,"*^ as soon as the pith has formed there a small %0a%3c round knob ; but before it has done this, the concavity that is %0a%3c left upon the surface is merely called the " eye when situate %0a%3c at the extremity of the shoot, it is known as the " germ."*" %0a%3c It is in the same way, too, that the stock branches, suckers, %0a%3c grapes, leaves, and tendrils of the vine are developed : and it %0a%3c is a very surprising fact, that aU that grows on the right" %0a%3c side of the tree is stronger and stouter than on the left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence it is, that when slips of this tree are planted, it is %0a%3c necessary to cut these knots in the middle, in order to prevent %0a%3c the pith from making its escape. In the same way, too, %0a%3c when planting the fig, suckers are taken, nine inches in length, %0a%3c and after the ground is opened they are planted with the part %0a%3c downwards that grew nearest to the tree, and with a couple of %0a%3c eyes protruding from the earth — in slips of trees, that part is %0a%3c properly called the eye which is to give birth to the future %0a%3c bud. It is for this reason that, in the seed-plots even the %0a%3c %0a%3c ludes to the trees from which the upriglits or stays for the vine are cut, or %0a%3c which produce osiers for baskets and bindings required in the vintage. %0a%3c 81 See B. xiii. c. 42, and B. xvi. c. 65. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Gemma."

Fig-trees that are thus planted may %0a%3c very easily be transplanted in the third year. As some com- %0a%3c pensation for the rapidity with which this tree becomes ^« old %0a%3c it has thus received the privilege of coming to maturity" at a %0a%3c very early period. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine throws out a great number of shoots. In the first %0a%3c place, however, none of them are ever used for planting, %0a%3c except those which are useless, and would have been cut away %0a%3c as mere brushwood ; while, on the other hand, every part is %0a%3c pruned off that has borne fruit the previous year. In former %0a%3c times, it was the custom to plant the slip with a head at the %0a%3c extremity, consisting of a piece of the hard wood on each side %0a%3c of it, the same, in fact, that is called a mallet shoot at the %0a%3c present day. In more recent times, however, the practice %0a%3c has been adopted of pulling it off merely with a heel attached %0a%3c to it, as in the fig and there is no kind of slip that takes %0a%3c with greater certainty. A tliird method, again, has been added %0a%3c to the former ones, and a more simple one as well, that of %0a%3c taking the slip without any heel at all. These slips are %0a%3c known by the name of arrow-^shoots, when they arc; twisted %0a%3c before planting ; and the same, when they are neither cut %0a%3c short nor twisted, are called three-budded"' slips. The same %0a%3c sucker very often furnishes several slips of this kind. To %0a%3c plant a stock-shoot*- of the vine is unproductive, and, indeed, %0a%3c no shoots will bear unless they are taken from a part that has %0a%3c borne fruit already. A slip that has but few knots upon it, is %0a%3c looked upon as likely not to bear ; while a great number of %0a%3c buds is considered an indication of fruitfulncss. Some persons %0a%3c say that no suckers ought to be planted, but those which have %0a%3c already blossomed.

It is considered %0a%3c the most advantageous plan to plant them out the same day %0a%3c that they are cut ; but if it is found necessary to plant them %0a%3c some time after, they should be kept in the way that we have %0a%3c already mentioned particular care being taken not to let %0a%3c them protrude from the earth, lest they should become dried %0a%3c by the action of the sun, or nipped by the wind or frost. %0a%3c When they have been kept too long in a dry place, they must %0a%3c be put in water for several days, for the purpose of restoring %0a%3c their verdancy and freshness. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spot selected, whether for nursery or vineyard, ought %0a%3c to be exposed to the sun, and of as great extent as possible ; %0a%3c the soil being turned up to a depth of three feet with a two- %0a%3c pronged fork. The earth, on being thrown up with the mat- %0a%3c tock,^*^ swells naturally,"'' and ridges are formed with it four feet %0a%3c in height, intersected by trenches a couple"'* of feet in depth. %0a%3c The earth in the trenches is carefully cleansed and raked out,"" %0a%3c so that none of it may be left unbroken, care being taken also %0a%3c to keep it exactly level ; if the ridges are unequal, it shows %0a%3c that the ground has been badly dug. At the same time. the %0a%3c breadth should be measured of each ridge that lies between %0a%3c the trenches. The slips are planted either in holes or else in %0a%3c elongated furrows, and then covered with very fine earth ; %0a%3c but w^here it is a light soil, the grower will lose his pains %0a%3c should he neglect to place a layer of richer mould beneath. %0a%3c Not less than a couple of slips should be planted together, %0a%3c keeping them exactly on a level with the adjoining earth, %0a%3c which should be pressed down and made compact with the %0a%3c dibble. In the seed-plot there should be intervals left between %0a%3c each two settings a foot and a half in breadth and half a foot %0a%3c in length : when thus planted, it is usual, at the end of two %0a%3c years, to cut the mallet-shoots at the knot nearest the ground, %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 From Columella, B. iii. c. 19. as in c. 24 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 88 " Marra."

When this %0a%3c IS done, they throw out eyes, and with these upon them at the %0a%3c end ot three years the quicksets are transplanted. %0a%3c %0a%3c Ihereis another method, also, of planting^ the vine, which %0a%3c a luxurious refinement in these matters has introduced. Four %0a%3c maUet-shoots are tightly fastened together with a cord in the %0a%3c greenest part, and when thus arranged are passed through the %0a%3c shank-bone of an ox or else a tube of baked earth, after whicli %0a%3c they are planted in the ground, care being taken to leave a %0a%3c couple of buds protruding : in this way they become impreg- %0a%3c nated with moisture, and, immediately on being cut, throw out %0a%3c fresh wood. The tube is then broken, upon which the root, %0a%3c thus set at liberty, assumes fresh vigour, and the clusters== ulti- %0a%3c mately bear upon them grapes belonging to the four kinds %0a%3c thus planted together. %0a%3c %0a%3c In consequence of a more recent discovery, another method %0a%3c has been adopted. A mallet-shoot is split down the middle %0a%3c and the pith extracted, after which the two portions are fastened %0a%3c together, every care being taken not to inj ure the buds. The %0a%3c mallet-shoot is then planted in a mixture of earth and manure, %0a%3c and when it begins to throw out branches it is cut, the ground %0a%3c being repeatedl}^ dug about it. Columella^ assures us that the %0a%3c grapes of this plant will have no stones, but it is a more sur- %0a%3c prising thing that the slip itself should survive when tlius de- %0a%3c prived of the pith.'' Still, however, I think I ought not to %0a%3c omit the fact that there are some slips that grow without the or- %0a%3c dinary articulations of trees upon them ; thus, for instance, five %0a%3c or six very small sprigs of box,* if tied together and put in %0a%3c the ground, will take root. It was formerly made a point to %0a%3c take these sprigs from a box-tree that had not been lopped, as %0a%3c it was fancied that in the last case they would not live ; expe- %0a%3c rience, however, has since put an end to that notion. %0a%3c %0a%3c The culture of the vineyard naturally follows the training %0a%3c of the nursery. There are five* difterent kinds of vine : thai %0a%3c %0a%3c ' Tliis method is no longer nscd. %0a%3c %0a%3c - This, Fee remarks, is not the case : the tree might bear four kinds of %0a%3c grapes, but not four kinds on the same hunch. %0a%3c •* De Arbor, c. 9.

The mode of cultivation requisite for the %0a%3c propped vine may be understood as equally adapted to the one %0a%3c that stands by itself and requires no support, for this last me- %0a%3c thod is only employed where there is a scarcity of Avood for stays. %0a%3c The stay with the single cross-piece in a straight line is known %0a%3c by the name of " canterius." It is the best of all for the %0a%3c wine, for then the tree throws no shadow, and the grape is %0a%3c ripened continuously by the sun, while, at the same time, it %0a%3c derives more advantage from the action of the wind, and dis- %0a%3c engages the dew with greater facility : the superfluous leaves %0a%3c and shoots, too, are more easily removed, and the breaking up %0a%3c of the earth and other operations about the tree are effected %0a%3c with greater facility. But, above all, by the adoption of this %0a%3c method, the tree sheds its blossoms more beneficially than %0a%3c under any other circumstances. This cross-piece is generally %0a%3c made of a stake, or a reed, or else of a rope of hair or hemp, %0a%3c as is usually the case in Spain and at Brundisium. When the %0a%3c trellis is employed, wine is produced in greater quantities ; %0a%3c this method has its name of " compluviata" from the " com- %0a%3c pluvium" or square opening in the roofs of our houses ; the %0a%3c trellis is divided into four compartments by as many cross- %0a%3c pieces. This mode of planting the vine will now be treated %0a%3c of, and it will be found equally applicable to every kind, with %0a%3c the only difference that under this last method the operation %0a%3c is somewhat more complicated. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine is planted three different ways ; in a soil that has %0a%3c been turned up with the spade — the best of the three ; in fur- %0a%3c rows, which is the next best ; and in holes, the least advisable %0a%3c method of all : of the way in which ground is prepared by %0a%3c digging, we have made sufficient mention already.

The depth %0a%3c required for every kind of vine is three feet ; it should, there- %0a%3c fore, be made a point not to transplant any vine that is less %0a%3c than three feet in length, allowing then two buds to be above %0a%3c the ground. It will be necessary, too, to soften the earth by %0a%3c working little furrows at the bottom of the hole, and mixing %0a%3c it up Avith manure. Where the ground is declivitous, it is %0a%3c requisite that the hole should be deeper, in addition to which %0a%3c it should be artificially elevated on tlie edge of the lower side. %0a%3c Holes of this nature, which are made a little longer, to receive %0a%3c two vines, are know^n as "alvei," or beds. The root of the %0a%3c vine should occupy the middle of the liolc, and when firmly %0a%3c fixed in the ground it should incline at the top due east ; its %0a%3c first support it ought to receive from a reed.''' The vineyard %0a%3c should be bounded by a decuman^'' path eighteen feet in width, %0a%3c sufficiently wide, in fact, to allow two carts to pass each other ; %0a%3c others, again, should run at right angles to it, ten feet in %0a%3c width, and passing through the middle of each jugerum ; or %0a%3c else, if the vineyard is of very considerable extent, cardinal'* %0a%3c paths may be formed instead of them, of the same breadth as %0a%3c the decuman path. At the end, too, of every five of the stays a %0a%3c path should be made to run, or, in other words, there should %0a%3c be one continuous cross-piece to every five stays ; each space %0a%3c that is thus included from one end to the other forming a %0a%3c bed.'^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Where the soil is dense and hard it must be turned up only %0a%3c with the spade, and nothing but quicksets should be planted %0a%3c there ; but where, on the other hand, it is thin and loose, %0a%3c mallet-shoots even may be set either in hole or furrow. Where %0a%3c the ground is declivitous it is a better plan to draw furrows %0a%3c across than to turn up all the soil with the spade, so that the %0a%3c falling away of the earth may be counteracted by the position %0a%3c of the cross-pieces.'« It will be best, too, where the weatlier %0a%3c %0a%3c arc made to run as much as possible from east to west.

[Book XVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is wet or the soil naturally dry, to plant the mallet-shoots in %0a%3c autumn, unless, indeed, there is anything in the nature of the %0a%3c locality to counteract it ; for while a dry, hot soil makes it %0a%3c necessary to plant in autumn, in a moist, cold one it may be %0a%3c necessary to defer it until the end of spring even. In a %0a%3c parched soil, too, it would be quite in vain to plant quicksets, %0a%3c and it is far from advantageous to set mallet-shoots in a dry %0a%3c ground, except just after a fall of rain. On the other hand, %0a%3c in moist localities, a vine in leaf eveii may be transplanted and %0a%3c thrive very M'ell, and that, too, even as late as the summer %0a%3c solstice, in Spain, for example. It is of very considerable ad- %0a%3c vantage that there should be no wind stirring on the day of %0a%3c planting, and, though many persons are desirous that there %0a%3c should be a south wind blowing at the time, Cato" is of quite %0a%3c a different way of thinking. %0a%3c %0a%3c In a soil of medium quality, it is best to leave an interval of %0a%3c five'^ feet between every two vines ; where it is very fertile %0a%3c the distance should be five feet at least, and where it is poor %0a%3c and thin eight at the very most. The Umbri and the Marsi %0a%3c leave intervals between their vines of as much as twenty feet %0a%3c in length, for the purpose of ploughing between them ; such %0a%3c a plot of ground as this they call by the name of "porcule- %0a%3c tum," In a rainy, foggy locality, the plants ought to be set %0a%3c wider apart, but in diy spots nearer to one another. Careful %0a%3c observation has discovered various methods of economizing %0a%3c space ; thus, for instance, when a vineyard is planted in %0a%3c shaded ground, a seed-plot is formed there as well ; or, in %0a%3c other words, at the same time that the quickset is planted in %0a%3c the place which it is finally to occupy, the mallet-shoot in- %0a%3c tended for transplanting is set between the vines, as well as %0a%3c between the rows. By adopting this method, each jugerum %0a%3c will produce about sixteen thousand quicksets ; and the result %0a%3c is, that two years' fruit is gained thereby, a cutting planted %0a%3c being two years later in bearing than a quickset transplanted. %0a%3c Quicksets, when growing in a vineyard, are cut down at %0a%3c the end of a year, leaving only a single eye above ground ; %0a%3c %0a%3c more especially as it agrees with what has been previously said in this %0a%3c Chapter in reference to declivitous ground. %0a%3c " De Re Rust. 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1* He differs somewhat in these measurements from Columella, B. %0a%3c iv. c. 11. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cliap. 3.3.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CPLTUUE OF THE VIXE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 503 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c some manure is then placed npon the Bpot, and a stay driven %0a%3c in close to the plant. In the same manner it is a^^ain cut %0a%3c down at the end of the second year, and from this it acquires %0a%3c additional strength, and receives nutriment to enable it to %0a%3c endure the onerous task of reproduction . If this is neglected %0a%3c m Its over-haste to bear it will shoot up slim and meagre %0a%3c like a bulrush, and from not being subjected to such a train- %0a%3c ing, will grow to nothing but wood. In fact, there is no tree %0a%3c that grows with greater eagerness than the vine, and if its %0a%3c strength is not carefully husbanded for tlie bearing of fruit, it %0a%3c will be sure to grow to nothing but wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best props for supporting the vino are those which we %0a%3c have already mentioned,^" or else stays made of the robur and %0a%3c the olive; if these cannot be procured, then props of juniper, %0a%3c cypress, laburnum, or elder,-' must be employed. If any oilier %0a%3c wood is used for the purpose, the stakes should be cut at the %0a%3c end each year : reeds tied together in bundles make excellent %0a%3c cross-rails for the vine, and will last as long as five years. %0a%3c Sometimes the shorter stock-branches of the vines are brought %0a%3c together and tied Avith vine-cuttings, like so many cords : by %0a%3c this method an arcade is formed, known to us by the name of %0a%3c " funetum." %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine, by the end of the third year, throws out strong %0a%3c and vigorous stock-branches Avith the gicatest rapidity, and %0a%3c these in due time form the tree ; after tliis, it begins to mount %0a%3c the cross-piece. Some persons are in the habit of " blinding" %0a%3c the vine at this period, by removing tlie eyes with the end of %0a%3c the pruning-knife turned upwards, their object being to in- %0a%3c crease the length of the branches — a most injurious practice, %0a%3c however ; for it is far better to let the tree become habituated %0a%3c to grow of itself, and to prune away the tendrils every now %0a%3c and then when they have reached the cross-rail, so long as it %0a%3c may be deemed proper to add to its strength. There are some %0a%3c persons who forbid the vine to be toucliod for a whole year %0a%3c after it has been transplanted, and avIio say that tlie pruning- %0a%3c knife ought never to, be used before it is five years old ; and %0a%3c %0a%3c »» This is condemned by Columella, B. iv. c. 11 ; but is approved of by %0a%3c Virgil, Cato, and otber autbors. %0a%3c 2" In c. 34 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Stays of elder would be utterly worthless, as they would soon rot, and %0a%3c break directly, upon the least strain. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 504 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's NATUEAIi HISTOEr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c then at that period they are for cutting it down bo completely %0a%3c as to leave three buds only. Others, again, cut down the vine %0a%3c within a year even after it has been transplanted, but then %0a%3c they take care to let the stem increase everj' year by three or %0a%3c four joints, bringing it on a level with the cross-piece by the %0a%3c fourth. These two methods, however, both of them, retard the %0a%3c fruit and render the tree stunted and knotty, as we see the %0a%3c case in all dwarf trees. The best plan is to make the parent %0a%3c stem as robust and vigorous as possible, and then the wood %0a%3c will be sure to be strong and hardy. It is far from safe, too, %0a%3c to take slips from a cicatrized stem ; such a practice is erro- %0a%3c neous, and only the result of ignorance. All cuttings of this %0a%3c nature are sure to be the offspring of acts of violence, and not %0a%3c in reality of the tree itself. The vine, while growing, should %0a%3c be possessed of all its natural strength ; and we find that %0a%3c when left entirely to itself, it will throw out wood in every %0a%3c part ; for there is no portion of it that Nature does not act %0a%3c upon. When the stem has grown sufficiently strong for the %0a%3c purpose, it should at once be trained to the cross-piece ; if, how- %0a%3c evei", it is but weak, it should be cut down so as to lie below %0a%3c the hospitable shelter of the cross-piece. Indeed, it is tlie %0a%3c strength of the stem, and not its age, that ought to decide the %0a%3c matter. It is not advisable^* to attempt to train a vine before %0a%3c the stem has attained the thickness of the thumb ; but in the %0a%3c year after it has reached the frame, one or two stock- branches %0a%3c should be preserved, according to the strength developed by %0a%3c the parent tree. The same, too, must be done the succeeding %0a%3c year, if the weakness of the stem demands it ; and in the next, %0a%3c two more should be added. Still, however, there should never %0a%3c be more than four branches allowed to grow; in one word, %0a%3c there must be no indulgence shown, and every exuberance in %0a%3c the tree must in all cases be most carefully repressed ; for %0a%3c such is the nature of the vine, that it is more eager to bear %0a%3c than it is to live. It should be remembered, too, that all that %0a%3c is subtracted from the wood is so much added to the fruit. %0a%3c The vine, in fact, would much rather produce shoots and ten- %0a%3c drils than fruit, because"* its fruit, after all, is but a transitory %0a%3c possession : hence it is that it luxuriates to its owti undoing, %0a%3c and instead of really gaining ground, exhausts itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 This applies solely, Fee observes, to the vine trained on the trail or %0a%3c cross-piece. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^* This certainly appears to be a non sequitur, as applied to the vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 35.] CULTUEE OF THE VINE. 505 %0a%3c %0a%3c The nature too, of the soil will afford some very useful %0a%3c suggestions Where It IS thin and hungry, even though the %0a%3c vine should display considerable vigour, it should be pruned %0a%3c down below the cross-piece and kept tbere, so that all the %0a%3c shoots may be put forth below it. The interval, however, be- %0a%3c twecn the top of the vine and the cross-piece ought to be but %0a%3c very small ; so much so, indeed, as to leave it hopes, as it %0a%3c were, ot reaching it, which, however, it must never be suffered %0a%3c to do ; for it should never be allowed to recline thereon and %0a%3c spread and run on at its ease. This mode of culture ought, in %0a%3c fact, to_ be so nicely managed, that the vine should show an %0a%3c inclination rather to grow in body than to run to wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c The main branch should have two or three buds left below %0a%3c the cross-piece that give promise of bearing wood, and it %0a%3c should be carefully trained along the rail, and drawn close %0a%3c to it in such a manner as to be supported by it, and not %0a%3c merely hang loosely from itl When this is done, it should %0a%3c be tightly fastened also Avith a binding three buds off, a %0a%3c method which will greatly contribute to check the too abun- %0a%3c dant growth of the wood, while stouter shoots will be thrown %0a%3c out b(!low the ligature : it is absolutely forbidden, how- %0a%3c ever, to tie the extremity of the main branch. When all %0a%3c this is done. Nature operates in the following way — the parts %0a%3c that are allowed to fall downward, or those which are held fast %0a%3c by the ligature, give out fruit, those at the bend of the branch %0a%3c more particularly. On the other hand, the portion that lies %0a%3c below the ligature throws out wood ; by reason, I suppose, of %0a%3c the interception of the vital spirit and the marrow or pilli, pre- %0a%3c viously mentioned r*^ the wood, too, that is grown under these %0a%3c circumstances wiU bear fruit in the following year. In this %0a%3c way there are two kinds of stock branches : the first of which, %0a%3c issuing from the solid stock, gives promise of wood only for %0a%3c this year, and is known as the leaf stock-branch Avhile that %0a%3c Avhicli grows beyond the mark made by the ligature is a i'ruit %0a%3c stock-branch.-" There are other kinds, again, that shoot from %0a%3c the stock-branches when they arc a year old, and these are in %0a%3c all cases fruit stock-branches.

It is thought equally undesirable, %0a%3c too, to let an old stock-branch range far and wide, and extend %0a%3c as far as the fourth stay from the stem ; to such a branch the %0a%3c name of dragon^^-branch is given by some, and of juniculus by %0a%3c others ; if these are allowed to spread, they will run to wood %0a%3c only, and make male vines, as they are called. When a vine %0a%3c has become quite hard, it is an extremely bad plan to use it. %0a%3c for reproduction by layers. When the vine is five j'cars old %0a%3c the stock-branches are twisted, but each is allowed to throw %0a%3c out some new wood ; and so from one to another, care being %0a%3c taken to prune away the old wood. It is always the best %0a%3c plan, however, to leave a reserve shoot ; but this should always %0a%3c be very near the main stem of the vine, not at a greater dis- %0a%3c tance, in fact, than that already mentioned. If, too, the %0a%3c stock branches should throw out too luxuriantly, they must %0a%3c be twisted, the object being that the vine may put forth no %0a%3c more than four secondary branches, or even two only, if it %0a%3c happens to be a single cross-railed vine. %0a%3c %0a%3c If the vine is to be trained to grow without any stay at all, %0a%3c still it will stand in need, at first, of some support or other, %0a%3c until it has learnt to support itself : in all other respects the %0a%3c mode of proceeding will be the same at fii'st.

Growers %0a%3c are in the habit of surrounding the vines that creep aW the %0a%3c ground with a low fence^^ for them to lean upon; and round %0a%3c this fence they dig a trench by way of precaution, for fear lost %0a%3c the branches in their range should meet one another and so %0a%3c come into collision. The greater part of the world, in fact, %0a%3c gather grapes at their vintage, grown in this fashion, and lying %0a%3c upon the ground— at all events, it is so in Africa, Egvpt, and %0a%3c byria ; tliroughout the whole of Asia, too, and in many parts %0a%3c oi Europe as well, this method prevails. In such cases the %0a%3c vine ouglit to be kept down close to the ground, and the root %0a%3c should be nurtured at the same time and in just the same way %0a%3c as in the case of the vine that grows on the cross-piece. Care, %0a%3c too, should be taken to leave only the young thumb-shoots, %0a%3c together with three buds, where it is a prolific soil, two where %0a%3c it is poor and thin : it is better, too, that the shoots should be %0a%3c numerous than individually long. The influences of soil, of %0a%3c which we have made mention already, will make themselves %0a%3c felt all the more powerfully the nearer the grapes grow to the %0a%3c ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a very advantageous plan to separate^ the various %0a%3c species of vines and to set them in different compartments — %0a%3c for the mixture of different varieties is apt to deteriorate the %0a%3c flavour not only of the must, but the wine even as well. If, %0a%3c again, for some reason or other, the different kinds must be %0a%3c intermingled, it will be requisite to keep all those together %0a%3c whicli ripen at exactly the same period. The more fertile and %0a%3c the more level the soil, the higher the cross-pieces must be %0a%3c placed." High cross-pieces, too, are best suited to localities %0a%3c that are subject to heavy dews and fogs, but not to those %0a%3c that are exposed to high winds ; on the other hand, wliere the %0a%3c soil is thin, parched, and arid, or exposed to the wind, the %0a%3c cross-pieces should be set lower. The cross-piece should be %0a%3c fastened to the stay with cords tied as tight as possible, while %0a%3c the bindings used for tying the vine shoidd be thin.

Many per- %0a%3c sons recommend that the vineyard should be turned up with %0a%3c the spade after every dew that falls in the summer. Others, %0a%3c again, forbid this practice when the vine is in bud ; for the %0a%3c clothes, they say, of tlie jjeople coming and going to and fro %0a%3c are apt to catcli the buds, and either knock or rub them off ; %0a%3c it is for this reason, too, that they ai'e so careful to keep all %0a%3c animals away from the vines, those with long wool in parti- %0a%3c cular, as it is verj' apt to pull off the buds. Halving, too, %0a%3c they say, is very injurious to the vine Avhile the grape is form- %0a%3c ing ; and it Avill be quite sufficient, they assure us, if the %0a%3c ground is turned up three times in the j'oar, after the vernal %0a%3c equinox — first, at the rising of the Vergiliae,^' the second at %0a%3c the rising of the Dog-star, and the third time just as the grape %0a%3c is turning black. Some persons make it a rule that an old %0a%3c vineyard shall have one turning up between the time of vin- %0a%3c tage and the winter solstice, though others, again, are of opi- %0a%3c nion that it is quite sufficient to bare the roots and manure %0a%3c them. They turn up the ground again after the ides of April,*" %0a%3c but before the time for germination, or, in other words, the %0a%3c sixth of the ides of May then again before the tree begins %0a%3c to blossom, after it has shed its blossom, and, last of all, %0a%3c when the grape is just on the turn. The most skilful growers %0a%3c say that if the ground is dug up oftener than necessary, the %0a%3c grapes will become so remarkably thin-skinned as to burst. %0a%3c When the ground is turned up, care should be taken to do it %0a%3c before the hot hours of the day ; a clayey soil, too, should %0a%3c never be ploughed or dug. The dust that is raised in digging %0a%3c is beneficial" to the vine, it is said, by protecting it from the %0a%3c heat of the sun and the injurious effects of fogs. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spring clearing ought to be done, it is universally ad- %0a%3c mitted, within ten days after the ides of May,'»^ and before the %0a%3c %0a%3c 38 In B. xiv. cc. 4 and 5. 39 g xviii. c 66 %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 13th of April. « 10th of May.

As to the second clearing, opi- %0a%3c nions differ very considerably. Some think it ought to be done %0a%3c when the blossoming is over, others, again, when the grapes %0a%3c are nearly at maturity. This point, however, may be decided %0a%3c by following the advice of Cato on the subject ; for we must %0a%3c now pass on to a description of the proper mode of nruninjr %0a%3c the vine. i b %0a%3c %0a%3c Immediately after" the vintage, and while the weather is still %0a%3c warm, the work of pruning" begins ; this, however, ought never %0a%3c to be done, for certain physical reasons,*^ before the rising of the %0a%3c Eagle, as we shall have occasion to explain in the following %0a%3c Book. Nor sliould it be done either when the west winds %0a%3c begin to prevail, for even then there is great doubt whether a %0a%3c fault may not be committed by being in too great haste to %0a%3c commence the work. If any return of wintry weather should %0a%3c chance to nip the vines, while still labouring under the wounds %0a%3c recently inflicted on them in pruning, there is little doubt %0a%3c that their buds will become quite benumbed with cold, the %0a%3c wounds will open again, and the eyes, moistened by the juices %0a%3c tliat distil from the tree, will become frost-bitten by the rigour %0a%3c of the weather. For who is there,'"' in fact, that does not know %0a%3c that the buds are rendered brittle by frost ? All this, how- %0a%3c ever, depends upon accurate calculations in the management of %0a%3c large grounds, and the blame of precipitation cannot with any %0a%3c justice be laid upon Nature. The earlier the vine is pruned, %0a%3c in suitable weather, the greater is the (quantity of wood, while %0a%3c the later the pruning, the more abundant is the fruit. Hence %0a%3c it is that it is most advisable to prune the poor meagre vines %0a%3c first, and to defer pruning the more thriving ones to the very %0a%3c last. In pruning, due care should always be taken to cut in %0a%3c a slanting direction, in order^'' that the rain may run off with %0a%3c all the greater facility. The wounds, too, should look down- %0a%3c %0a%3c of a higher colour, but in no degree riper than they otherwise would have %0a%3c been. %0a%3c %0a%3c " The proper period for pruning varies in reality according to the %0a%3c climate. %0a%3c « See B. xviii. c 59. %0a%3c %0a%3c « See Columella, De Kc Rust. B. iv. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c The real reason, as Fee remarks, is the comparative facility of cutting %0a%3c aslant rather than horizontally ; indeed, if the latter were attempted, injury %0a%3c to the wood would be the certain result. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 510 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's kattjeal histoey.

Care should be %0a%3c taken, too, to cut always between two buds, and that the eyes %0a%3c are not injured in the operation. It is generally thought that %0a%3c wherever the vine is black, all those parts may be cut off, the %0a%3c healthy parts not being touched ; as no useful shoots can be %0a%3c put forth by wood that is bad in itself. If a meagre vine has %0a%3c not good stock-shoots, the best plan is to cut it down to the %0a%3c ground, and then to train new ones. In clearing away the %0a%3c leaves, too, those leaves should not be removed which accompany %0a%3c the clusters, ,for by so doing the grapes are made to fall off, ex- %0a%3c cept where the vine happens to be young. Those leaves are %0a%3c regarded as useless which grow on the sides of the trunk and %0a%3c not from an eye ; and so, too, are the bunches which shoot %0a%3c from the hard, strong wood, and are only to be removed by the %0a%3c aid of the knife. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons are of opinion that it is a better plan to fix %0a%3c the stay midway between two vines ; and, indeed, by the adop- %0a%3c tion of this method the roots are cleared with greater facility. %0a%3c It is best, however, where the vine needs but a single cross- %0a%3c rail, due care being taken that the rail is a strong one, and the %0a%3c locality not exposed to high winds. In the case of those %0a%3c vines which require trellissed cross-rails, the stay should be %0a%3c placed as near as possible to the burden it has to support ; in %0a%3c order, however, that there may be no impediment thrown in %0a%3c the way of clearing the roots, it may be placed at the distance %0a%3c of one cubit from the stock, but not more. It is generally %0a%3c recommended to clear the roots before the pruning" is com- %0a%3c menced. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato*' gives the following general precepts in relation to the %0a%3c culture of the vine : — " Let the vine grow as high as possible, %0a%3c and fasten it firmly, but not too tight. You should treat it in %0a%3c the following manner. Clean the roots of the vine at seed- %0a%3c time, and after pruning it dig about it, and then begin to %0a%3c labour at the ground, by tracing with the plough continuous %0a%3c furrows every way. Plant the young vines in layers as early %0a%3c as possible, and then break up the ground about them. If the %0a%3c %0a%3c *8 The pruning should come first, in every case, Fee says. %0a%3c *3 De Ke Rust, c 33. The advice given by him, though good, is not %0a%3c applieahle to all vineyards. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 35.J %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CULTURE OF THE TINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c .511 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vine IS old, take care and prune it as little as possible. In %0a%3c preference, bend the vine into the ground for layers, if neces- %0a%3c sary, and cut it at the end of two years. The proper time for %0a%3c cutting the young vine, is when it has gained sufficient %0a%3c strength. If the vineyard is bald of vines, then draw furrows %0a%3c between them, and plant quicksets there : but let no shadow %0a%3c be thrown on the furrows, and take care and dig them often. %0a%3c If the vineyard is old, sow ocinum* there, in case the trees are %0a%3c meagre : but take care and sow there nothing that bears seed. %0a%3c Put manure, chaff, and grapc-liusks about the roots, or, in- %0a%3c deed, anything of a similar nature that will give the tree ad- %0a%3c ditional strength. As soon as the vine begins to throw out %0a%3c leaves, set about clearing them. Fasten the j-oung trees in %0a%3c more places than one, so that the stem may not break. As %0a%3c soon as it begins to run along the stay, fasten down the young %0a%3c branches lightly, and extend them, in order that they may gain %0a%3c the right position. When the grape begins to be mottled, %0a%3c then tie down the vine. The first season for grafting the vine %0a%3c is the spring, the other when the grape is in blossom ; the last %0a%3c period is tlie best. If it is your wish to transplant an old %0a%3c vine, 5'ou will only be able to do so in case it is no thicker than %0a%3c the arm : first, however, you must prune it, taking care not to %0a%3c have more than two buds upon the stem. Then dig it well up %0a%3c by the roots, being careful to trace them, and using every %0a%3c possible precaution not to injure them. Place it in the hole or %0a%3c furrow exactly in the position in which it has stood before, %0a%3c then cover it with earth, which should be well trodden down. %0a%3c You must then prop it up, fasten it, and turn it in the same %0a%3c direction as before ; after which, dig about it repeatedly." The %0a%3c ocinum that Cato here recommends to be sown in the vine- %0a%3c yards, is a fodder known by that name by the ancients ; it %0a%3c thrives in the shade remarkably well, and received its name*' %0a%3c from the rapidity with which it grows. %0a%3c %0a%3c (23.)

Indeed, %0a%3c Scrofa himself will not admit that it is beneficial anywhere %0a%3c except in Itah'. The experience of ages, however, has suffi- %0a%3c ciently proved that the wines of the highest quality are only %0a%3c grown upon -vdncs attached to trees, and that even then the %0a%3c clioicest wines are produced by the upper part of the tree, the %0a%3c produce of the lower part being more abundant ; such being the %0a%3c beneficial results of elevating the vine. It is with a view to %0a%3c this that the trees employed for this purpose are selected. In %0a%3c the first rank of all stands the elm," with the exception of the %0a%3c Atinian. variety, which is covered with too many leaves ; and %0a%3c next comes the black poplar, which is valued for a similar %0a%3c reason, being not so densely covered with leaves. Most people, %0a%3c too, by no means hold the ash and the fig in disesteem, as %0a%3c also the olive, if it is not overshadowed with branches. We %0a%3c have treated at sufficient length already of the planting and %0a%3c culture of these several trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c They must not be touched with the knife before the end of %0a%3c three years ; and then the branches are preserved, on each side %0a%3c in its turn, the pruning being done in alternate years. In the %0a%3c sixth year the vine is united to the tree. In Italy beyond the %0a%3c Padus, in addition to the trees already mentioned, they plant %0a%3c for their vines the cornel, the opulus, the linden, the maple, %0a%3c the ash, the yoke-elm, -and the quercus ; while in Vcnetia they %0a%3c grow willows for the purpose, on account of the humidity" of %0a%3c the soil. The top of the elm is lopped away, and the branches %0a%3c of the middle are regularly arranged in stages ; no tree in %0a%3c general being allowed to exceed twenty feet in height. The %0a%3c stories begin to spread out in the tree at eight feet from the %0a%3c ground, in the hilly districts and upon dry soils, and at tv/elve %0a%3c in champaign and moist localities. The hands*^' of the trunk %0a%3c ought to have a southern aspect, and the branches that project %0a%3c from them should be stiff and rigid like so many fingers ; at %0a%3c the same time due care should be taken to lop off the thin %0a%3c beardlike twigs, in order to check the growth of all shade. %0a%3c The interval best suited for the trees, if it is the grower's in- %0a%3c tention to keq) the soil turned up with the plough, is forty feet %0a%3c back and front, and twenty at the side ; if it is not to be turned %0a%3c %0a%3c 5* All these trees are still employed for the puroose in Italy. %0a%3c *5 B. xvi. c. 68. 56 Palmte.

It is worse %0a%3c than useless to attach the vine before the tree has gained its %0a%3c full strength, as in such case its rapidity of growth would %0a%3c only tend to kill the tree. It is necessary to plant the ^-ine %0a%3c in a trench three feet in depth, leaving an interval of one %0a%3c foot between it and the tree. In this case there is no neces- %0a%3c sity for using mallet shoots, or for going to any expense in %0a%3c spading or digging ; for this method of training on trees has %0a%3c this advantage in particular, that it is beneficial even to the %0a%3c vine that corn should be sown in the same soil ; in addition to %0a%3c which, from its height, it is quite able to protect itself, and %0a%3c does not call for the necessity, as in the case of an ordinary %0a%3c vineyard, of enclosing it with walls and hedges or ditches, %0a%3c made at a considerable expense, to protect it from injury by %0a%3c animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the method of training upon trees, reproduction from %0a%3c quicksets or from layers is the only mode employed of all %0a%3c those that have been previously described ; the growing by %0a%3c layers being effected two different ways, as already mentioned. %0a%3c The plan, however, of growing from layers in baskets set upon %0a%3c the stages^ of the tree is the most approved one, as it ensures %0a%3c an efiicient protection from the ravages of cattle ; while, accord- %0a%3c ing to another method, a vine or else a stock-branch is bent %0a%3c into the ground near the tree it has previously occupied, or else %0a%3c the nearest one that may be at liberty. It is recommended %0a%3c that all parts of the parent tree that appear above ground %0a%3c should then be scraped, so that it may not throw out wood ; %0a%3c while at the same time there are never less than four buds on %0a%3c the part that is put into the ground for the purpose of taking %0a%3c root ; there are also two buds left above ground at the head. %0a%3c The vine intended for training on a tree is planted in a furrow %0a%3c four feet long, three broad, and two and a half in depth. At %0a%3c the end of a year the layer is cut to the pith, to enable it to %0a%3c strengthen gradually at the root ; after which, the end of the %0a%3c branch is pruned down to within two buds from the ground. %0a%3c At the end of two years the layer is completely separated %0a%3c from the stock, and buried deeper in the ground, that it may %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c " From Columella, B. v. c. 7. %0a%3c %0a%3c *8 This method is no longer employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. in. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c L L %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 514 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny's natural histobt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [J3ook XVI r. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c not shoot at the place where it has been cut. As to the quick- %0a%3c sets, they ought to be removed directly after the vintage. %0a%3c %0a%3c In more recent times, a plan has been discovered of planting %0a%3c a dragon branch near the tree — that being the name given to %0a%3c an old stock-branch that has become hard and tough in the %0a%3c course of years. For this purpose, it is cut as long as pos- %0a%3c sible, and the bark is taken of£ from three-fourths of its length, %0a%3c that being the portion which is to be buried in the ground ; %0a%3c hence it is, too, that it is called a " barked" plant. It is %0a%3c then laid at full length in the furrow, the remaining part pro- %0a%3c truding from the ground and reclining against the tree. This %0a%3c method is the most speedy one that can be adopted for growing %0a%3c the vine. If the vine is meagre or the soil impoverished, it is %0a%3c usual to keep it cut down as near to the ground as possible, %0a%3c until such time as the root is strengthened. Care, too, should %0a%3c be taken not to plant it covered with dew,*** nor yet Avhile the %0a%3c wind is blowing from the north. The vine itself ought to %0a%3c look towards the north-east, but the young stock-shoots should %0a%3c have a southern aspect. %0a%3c %0a%3c There should not be too great haste" in pruning a young %0a%3c vine, but a beginning should be made by giving the wood and %0a%3c foliage a circular form, care being taken not to prune it until %0a%3c it has become quite strong ; it should be remembered, too, %0a%3c that the vine, when trained upon a tree, is generally a year %0a%3c later in bearing fruit than when grown on the cross-piece. %0a%3c There are some persons, again, who altogether forbid that a %0a%3c vine should be pruned until such time as it equals the tree in %0a%3c height. At the first pruning it may be cut to within six feet %0a%3c from the ground, below which a shoot must be left, and en- %0a%3c couraged to run out by bending the young wood. Upon this %0a%3c shoot, when pruned, there should not be more than three buds %0a%3c left. The branches that take their rise from these buds should %0a%3c be trained in the following year upon the lowermost stages of %0a%3c the tree, and so in each successive year taught to climb to the %0a%3c higher ones. Care, too, should always be taken to leave one %0a%3c hard, woody branch at each stage, as well as one breeding %0a%3c shoot, at liberty to mount as high as it pleases. In addition %0a%3c to these precautions, in all pruning, those shoots should be cut %0a%3c off which have borne fruit the last year, and after the teu- %0a%3c %0a%3c " Columi.l]a, B. v. c. 6. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 35.] CULTUEE OF THE TINB. 515 %0a%3c %0a%3c drils" have been cut away on every side fresli branches should %0a%3c be trained to run along the stages. In Italy the pruning is so %0a%3c managed that the shoots and tendrils of the vines are arranged %0a%3c so as to cover the branches of the tree, while the shoots of the %0a%3c vine in their turn are surrounded with clusters of grapes. In %0a%3c Irallia, on the other hand, the vine is trained to pass from tree %0a%3c to tree. On the iEmilian Wav, again, the vine is seen em- %0a%3c bracing the trunks of the Atinian elms that line the road, %0a%3c while at the same time it carefully avoids their foliage.%3c« %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a mark of ignorance in some persons to suspend the %0a%3c vine with a cord beneath the branches of the tree, to the great %0a%3c risk of stifling it ; for it ought to be merely kept up with a %0a%3c withe of osier, and not tightly laced. Indeed, in those places %0a%3c where the willow abounds, the withes that it affords are pre- %0a%3c ferred, on account of their superior suppleness, while the Sici- %0a%3c hans employ for the purpose a grass, which they call " ampelo- %0a%3c desraos throughout the whole of Greece, rushes, cj'perus, %0a%3c and 6fdge«* are similarly employed. When at any time the %0a%3c vine has been liberated from its bonds, it should be allowed to %0a%3c range uncontrolled for some days, and to spread abroad at %0a%3c pleasure, as well as to recline upon the ground which it has %0a%3c been looking down upon the whole year through. For in the %0a%3c same manner that beasts of burden when released from the %0a%3c yoke, and dogs when they have returned from the chase, love %0a%3c to roll themselves on the ground, just so does the vine delight %0a%3c to stretch its loins. The tree itself, too, seems to rejoice, and, %0a%3c thus relieved from the continuous weight which has burdened %0a%3c it, to have all the appeai'ance of now enjoying a free respira- %0a%3c tion. Indeed, there is no object in all the economy of Nature %0a%3c that does not desire certain alternations for the enjoyment of %0a%3c rest, witness the succession of night and day, for instance. It %0a%3c is for this reason that it is forbidden to prune the vine directly %0a%3c the vintage is over, and while it is still exhausted by the %0a%3c process of reproduction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Directly the vine has been pruned, it ought to be fastened %0a%3c again to the tree, but in another place ; for there is no doubt %0a%3c that it feels very acutely the indentations that are made in it %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Capreolis.

In the Gallic method of cultivation they %0a%3c train out two branches at either side, if the trees are forty fet^t %0a%3c apart, and four if only twenty; where they meet, these branches %0a%3c are fastened together and made to grow in unison ; if, too, they %0a%3c are anywhere deficient in number or strength, care is taken %0a%3c to fortify them by the aid of small rods. In a case, however, %0a%3c where the branches are not sufficiently long to meet, they are %0a%3c artificially prolonged by means of a hook, and so united to the %0a%3c tree that desires their company. The branches thus trained to %0a%3c unite they used to prune at the end of the second year. But %0a%3c Avhere the vine is aged, it is a better plan to give them a longer %0a%3c time to reach the adjoining tree, in case they should not have %0a%3c gained the requisive thickness ; besides Avhich, it is always %0a%3c good to encourage the growth of the hard wood in the dragon %0a%3c branches. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is yet another method,** which occupies a middle %0a%3c place between this mode of propagation and that by layers. %0a%3c It consists of laying the entire vine in the earth, and then %0a%3c splitting the stock asunder by means of wedges ; the fibrous %0a%3c portions are then trained out in as many furrows, care being %0a%3c taken to support each of the slender plants by fastening it to %0a%3c a stake, and not to cut away the branches that shoot from the %0a%3c sides. The growers of Novara, not content with the mul- %0a%3c titude of shoots that run from tree to tree, nor yet with an %0a%3c abundance of branches, encourage the stock-branches to en- %0a%3c twine around forks planted in the ground for the purpose ; a %0a%3c method, however, which, in addition to the internal defects %0a%3c arising from the soil, imparts a harshness to the wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another fault, too, that is committed by the people %0a%3c of Varracina," near Eome — they only prune their vines every %0a%3c other year ; not, indeed, because it is advantageous to the tree, %0a%3c but from a fear lest, from the low prices fetched by their wines, %0a%3c the expense might exceed the profits. At Carseoli they adopt %0a%3c a middle course, by pruning away only the rotten parts of %0a%3c the vine, as well as those which are beginning to wither, and %0a%3c leaving the rest to bear finiit, after thus clearing away all %0a%3c superfluous incumbrances. The only nutriment they give %0a%3c it is this exemption from frequent pruning ; but unless the %0a%3c soil should happen to be a very rich one, the vine, under such %0a%3c %0a%3c It is no longer used, and Fee doubts its utility. %0a%3c Hardouin suggests " Tarracina." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 37.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE DISEASES OF TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 517 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a method of cultivatiou, will very soon degenerate to a wild %0a%3c state. %0a%3c %0a%3c The vine that is thus trained requires the ground to be %0a%3c ploughed very deep, though such is not the case for the so^-ing %0a%3c there of grain. It is not customary to cut away the leaves %0a%3c in this case, which, of course, is so much labour spared. %0a%3c The trees themselves require pruning at the same period %0a%3c as the vine, and are thinned by clearing away all useless %0a%3c branches, and such parts as would only absorb the nutriment. %0a%3c We have already «8 stated that the parts that are lopped should %0a%3c never look north or south : and it will be better still, if they %0a%3c have not a western aspect. The wounds thus made are very %0a%3c susceptible for a considerable time, and heal with the greatest %0a%3c difficulty, if exposed to excesses of cold or heat.

Trees, we find, are attacked by maladies ; %0a%3c and, indeed, what created thing is there that is exempt from %0a%3c these evils ? Still however, the affections of the forest trees, %0a%3c it is said, are not attended with danger to them, and the %0a%3c only damage they receive is from hail-storms while they are %0a%3c budding and blossoming ; with the exception, indeed, of being %0a%3c nipped cither by heat or cold blasts in unseasonable weather ; %0a%3c for frost, when it comes at the proper times, as we have akeady %0a%3c stated,™ is serviceable to them. " Well but," it will be said, %0a%3c " is not the vine sometimes killed with cold ?" No doubt it is, %0a%3c and this it is through which we detect inherent faults in the %0a%3c soils, for it is only in a cold soil that the vine will die. Just in %0a%3c the same way, too, in winter we approve of cold, so long aa %0a%3c it is the cold of the weather, and not of the ground. It is not %0a%3c the weakest trees, too, that are endangered in winter by frost, %0a%3c but the larger ones. When they are thus attacked, it is the %0a%3c summit that dries away the fii'st, from the circumstance that %0a%3c the sap becomes frozen before it is able to arrive there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some diseases of trees are common to them all, while %0a%3c others, again, arc peculiar to individual kinds- Worms are %0a%3c common to them all, and so, too, is sideration,'^ with pains in %0a%3c the limbs," which are productive of debility in the various %0a%3c parts. Thus do we apply the names of the maladies that pre- %0a%3c vail among mankind to those with which the plants are %0a%3c afflicted. In the same way, too, we speak of their bodies being %0a%3c mutilated, the eyes of the buds being burnt up, with many %0a%3c other expressions of a similar nature.

These worms even have now begun to be looked %0a%3c upon as delicacies by epicures, and the large ones found in %0a%3c the robur are held in high esteem ; they are known to us by %0a%3c the name of " cossis;" and are even fed with meal, in order %0a%3c to fatten them ! But it is the pear, the apple, and the fig^* %0a%3c that are most subject to their attacks, the trees that are bitter %0a%3c and odoriferous enjoying a comparative exemption from them. %0a%3c Of those which infest the fig, some breed in the tree itself, %0a%3c while others, again, are produced by the worm known as the %0a%3c cerastes ; they all, however, equally assume the form of the %0a%3c cerastes,^* and emit a small shrill noise.

The consequences of hoar-frost to plants arc %0a%3c even more dangerous still, for when it has once settled, it %0a%3c remains there in a frozen form, and there is never any wind to %0a%3c remove it, seeing that it never prevails except in weather that %0a%3c is perfectly calm and serene. Sideration, however, properly %0a%3c so called, is a certain heat and dryness that prevails at the %0a%3c rising of the^® Dog-star, and owing to which grafts and young %0a%3c trees pine away and die, the fig and the vine more particu- %0a%3c larly. The olive, also, besides the worm, to which it is equally %0a%3c subject with the fig, is attacked by the measles,*'' or as some %0a%3c think fit to call it, the fungus or platter ; it is a sort of blast %0a%3c produced by the heat of the sun. Cato^" says that the red %0a%3c moss'" is also deleterious to the olive. An excessive fertility, %0a%3c too, is very often injurious to the vine and the olive. Scab is a %0a%3c malady common to all trees. Eruptions,^- too, and the attacks %0a%3c of a kind of snail that grows on the bark, arc diseases peculiar %0a%3c to the fig, but not in all countries ; for there are some maladies %0a%3c that are prevalent in certain localities only. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same way that man is subject to diseases of the si- %0a%3c news, so are the trees as well, and, like him, in two different %0a%3c ways. Either®^ the virulence of the disease manifests itself in %0a%3c the feet, or, what is the same thing, the roots of the tree, or %0a%3c else in the joints of the fingers, or, in other words, the extre- %0a%3c mities of the branches that are most distant from the trunk. %0a%3c The parts that are thus affected become dry and shrivel up : %0a%3c the Greeks have appropriate names®^ by which to distinguish %0a%3c %0a%3c *5 The effects produced upon young shoots by frost, are still so called. %0a%3c %0a%3c Probably from the black colour which it turns. %0a%3c *8 In this case it would be very similar to what we call sun-stroke. %0a%3c ** "Clavum," a nail.

In either case the first symptoms are %0a%3c that tfie tree is suffering from pain, and the parts affected be- %0a%3c come emaciated and brittle ; then foUows rapid consumption %0a%3c and ultimately death ; the juices being no longer able to enter %0a%3c the diseased parts, or, at all events, not circulating in them. %0a%3c %0a%3c •fi -^^ ^^^^ particularly liable to this disease : but the %0a%3c wild fig IS exempt from all that we have hitherto mentioned. %0a%3c Scab^' IS produced by viscous dews which fall after the rising %0a%3c of the Vcrgiliae ; but if they happen to fall copiously, they %0a%3c drench the tree, without making the bark rough. When the %0a%3c fig is thus attacked, the fruit falls off while green ; and so, too, %0a%3c if there is too much rain. The fig suffers also from a super- %0a%3c fluity of moisture in the roots. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to worms and sideration, the vine is subject to %0a%3c a peculiar disease of its own, which attacks it in the joints, %0a%3c and is produced from one of the three following causes : — %0a%3c cither the destruction of the buds by stormy weather, or else %0a%3c the fact, as remarked by Theophrastus, that the tree, when %0a%3c pruned, has been cut with the incisions upwards,"" or has been %0a%3c injured from want of skill in the cultivator. All the injury %0a%3c that is inflicted in these various ways is felt by the tree in the %0a%3c joints more particularly. It must be considered also as a %0a%3c species of sideration, when the cold dews make the blossoms %0a%3c fall off, and when the grapes harden"' before they have attained %0a%3c their proper size. Vines also become sickly when they are %0a%3c perished with cold, and the eyes are frost-bitten just after they %0a%3c have been pruned. Heat, too, out of season, is productive of %0a%3c similar results : for everything is regulated according to a fixed %0a%3c order and certain determinate movements. Some maladies, %0a%3c too, originate in errors committed by the vine-dresscr ; when %0a%3c they are tied too tight, for instance, as already mentioned,"^ or %0a%3c Avhen in trenching round them the digger has struck them an %0a%3c unlucky blow, or when in ploughing about them the roots have %0a%3c been strained through carelessness, or the bark lias been %0a%3c stripped from off the trunk : sometimes, too, contusions are %0a%3c produced by the use of too blunt a pruning-knife.

The %0a%3c apple, however, is the most delicate of them all, and more %0a%3c particularly the one that bears the sweetest fruit. In some %0a%3c trees weakness induced by disease is productive of barrenness, %0a%3c and does not kill the tree ; as in the pine"'* for instance, or the %0a%3c palm, when the top of the tree has been removed ; for in such %0a%3c case the tree becomes barren, but docs not die. Sometimes, too, %0a%3c the fruit itself is sicldy, independently of the tree ; for example, %0a%3c when there is a deficiency of rain, or of warmth, or of wind, %0a%3c at the periods at which they usually prevail, or when, on the %0a%3c other hand, they have prevailed in excess ; for in such cases the %0a%3c fruit will either drop off or else deteriorate. But the worst %0a%3c thing of all that can befall the vine or the olive, is to be pelted %0a%3c with hea\'7 showers just when the tree is shedding its blossom, %0a%3c for then the fruit is sure to fall off' as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c liain, too, is productive of the caterpillar, a noxious insect %0a%3c that eats away the leaves, and, some of them, the blossoms as %0a%3c well ; and this in the olive even, as we find the case at Miletus ; %0a%3c giving to the half-eaten tree a most loathsome appearance. This %0a%3c pest is produced by the prevalence of a damp, languid heat ; %0a%3c and if the sun should happen to shine after this with a more %0a%3c intense heat and burn them up, this pest only gives place to %0a%3c another- just as bad, the aspect only of the evil being changed. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is still one other affection that is peculiar to the olive %0a%3c and the vine, known as the "cobweb,"^ the fruit being en- %0a%3c veloped in a web, as it were, and so stifled. There are certain %0a%3c winds, too, that are particularly blighting to the olive and the %0a%3c vine, as also to other fruits as well : and then besides, the fruits %0a%3c themselves, independently of the tree, are very much worm- %0a%3c eaten in some years, the apple, pear, medlar, and pomegranate %0a%3c for instance.

The prevalence %0a%3c of showers after the rising of Arcturus^ prevents them from %0a%3c breeding ; but if the rains are accompanied with wind from %0a%3c the south, they will make their appearance in the ripe fruit %0a%3c even, which are then very apt to fall. This nappcns more %0a%3c particularly in moist, watery localities ; and even if they do %0a%3c not fall, the olives that are so aflectcd are good for nothing. %0a%3c There is a kind of flj^ also that is very troublesome to some %0a%3c fruit, acorns and figs for instance : it would appear that they %0a%3c breed from the juices* secreted beneath the bark, which at %0a%3c this period are sweet. These trees, too, are generally in a %0a%3c diseased state when this happens. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are certain teraporaiy and local influences which cause %0a%3c instantaneous death to trees, but which cannot properly be %0a%3c termed diseases ; such, for example, as consumption, blast, or %0a%3c the noxious effects of some winds that are peculiar to certain %0a%3c localities ; of this last nature are the Atabulus® that prevails %0a%3c in Apulia, and the Olyrapias'' of Euboea. This wind, if it %0a%3c happens to blow about the winter solstice, nips the tree with %0a%3c cold, and shrivels it up to such a degree that no warmth of the %0a%3c sun can ever revive it. Trees that are planted iu valleys, and %0a%3c are situate near the banks of rivers, are especially liable to %0a%3c these accidents, the vine more particularly, the olive, and the %0a%3c fig. When this has been the case, it may instantly be detected %0a%3c the moment the period for germination arrives, though, in the %0a%3c olive, somewhat later. With all of these trees, if the leaves %0a%3c fall off, it is a sign that they will recover ; but if such is not %0a%3c the case, just when you would suppose that they have escaped %0a%3c uninjured, they die. Sometimes, however, the leaves will %0a%3c become green again, after being dry and shrivelled. Other %0a%3c trees, again, in the northern regions, Pontus and Phrygia, for %0a%3c example, suffer greatly from cold or frost, in case they should %0a%3c continue for forty days after the winter solstice. In these %0a%3c countries, too, as well as in other parts, if a sharp frost or co- %0a%3c pious rains should happen to come on immediately after fruc- %0a%3c tification, the fruit is killed in a very few days even. %0a%3c %0a%3c * See B. xviii. c. 74. ,,,-•,%3c. %0a%3c » On the contrary, this sweet juice is secreted b)' the insect itself, an %0a%3c aphis or vine-fretter. %0a%3c « The north-west wind.

Thus, for instance, jjitch, oil, and grease,** if aj)- %0a%3c plied to trees, and young ones more particularly, arc higlily %0a%3c detrimental. Tlicy may be killed, also, by removing a circular %0a%3c piece of the bark from around them, with the exception, in- %0a%3c deed, of the cork-tree,' which is rather benefitted than other- %0a%3c wise by the operation ; for the bark as it gradually thickens %0a%3c tends to stifle and sufibcate the tree : the andrachle,"* too, re- %0a%3c ceives no injury from it, if care is taken not to cut the bodj' %0a%3c of the tree. In addition to this, the cherry, the lime, and the %0a%3c vine shed their bark not that portion of it, indeed, which is %0a%3c essential to life, and grows next the trunk, but the part that %0a%3c is thrown off", in proportion as the other grows beneath. In %0a%3c some trees the bark is naturally full of fissures, the plane for %0a%3c instance : in the linden it will all but grow again when re- %0a%3c moved. Hence, in those trees the bark of which admits of %0a%3c cicatrization, a mixture of clay and dung''^ is employed by way %0a%3c of remedy ; and sometimes with success, in case excessive cold %0a%3c or heat does not immediately supervene. In some trees, again, %0a%3c by the adoption of these methods death is only retarded, the %0a%3c robur and the quercus," for example. The season of the year %0a%3c has also its peculiar influences ; thus, if the bark is removed %0a%3c from the fir and the pine, while the sun is passing through %0a%3c Taurus or Gemini, the period of their germination, they will %0a%3c instantly die, while in winter they are able to withstand the %0a%3c injurious eff'ects of it much longer : the same is the case, too, %0a%3c with the holm-oak, the robur, and the quercus. In the trees %0a%3c above mentioned, if it is only a narrow circular strip of bark %0a%3c that is removed, no injurious eff'ects will be perceptible ; but %0a%3c in the case of the weaker trees, as well as those which grow in %0a%3c a thin soil, the same operation, if pex'formed even on one side %0a%3c only, will be sure to kill them. The removal of the top,'* in %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ He probably means if applied to the bark of young trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c ' The cork-tree forms no exception to the rule — if a complete ring of %0a%3c the bark that lies under the epidermis is removed, the death of the tree is %0a%3c the inevitable result.

For we find some %0a%3c trees that have never had a leaf upon them ; a vine and a pome- %0a%3c granate bearing-^ fruit adhering to the trunk, and not upon %0a%3c the shoots or branches ; a vine, too, that bore grapes but had %0a%3c no leaves ; and olives that have lost their leaves while the frnit %0a%3c remained upon the tree. There are some marvels also connected %0a%3c with trees that are owing to accident ; an olive that was com- %0a%3c pletely burnt, has been known to revive, and in I3ccotia, some %0a%3c fig-trees that had been quite eaten away by locusts budded %0a%3c afresh.^*' Trees, too, sometimes change their colour, and turn %0a%3c from black to white ; this, however, must not always be looked %0a%3c upon as portentous, and more particularly in the case of those %0a%3c which are grown from seed; the white poplar, too, often becomes %0a%3c black. Some persons are of opinion also that the service-tree, %0a%3c if transplanted to a warmer locality, will become barren, liut %0a%3c it is a prodig)-, no doubt, when sweet fruits become sour, or %0a%3c sour fruits sweet ; and when the wild fig becomes changed %0a%3c into the cultivated one, or vice versa. It is sadly portentous,''' %0a%3c too, when the tree becomes deteriorated by the change, the %0a%3c cultivated olive changing into the wild, and the white grape %0a%3c or fig becoming black : such was the case, also, when upon the %0a%3c arrival of Xerxes there, a plane-tree at Laodicea was trans- %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See B. xix. c. 26. 27 yirgii shared this belief: see Georg. ii. 1. 299. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This may be true in some measure as to. nitre, alum, and warm sea- %0a%3c water ; but not so as to the shells of beans and pigeon-pease, which would %0a%3c make an excellent manure for it. %0a%3c %0a%3c *^ This, as Fee remarks, is not by any means impossible, nor, indeed, %0a%3c are any other of the cases mentioned in this paragraph, owin? to some %0a%3c accidental circumstance. ggg £ xxix. c. 29 %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 These stories can, of course, be only regarded as fabulous. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 38.] PU0DIGIE3 CONNECTED WITH TIIEES. 527 %0a%3c %0a%3c formed into an olive. In such narratives as these, the book %0a%3c written in Greek by Aristander abounds, not to enter any fur- %0a%3c ther on so extended a subject ; and we have in Latin the Com- %0a%3c mentaries of C. Epidius, in which we find it stated that trees %0a%3c have even been known to speak. In the territory of Cumaj, a tree, %0a%3c and a very ominous presage it was, sank into the earth shortly %0a%3c before the civil wars of Porapeius Magnus began, leaving only %0a%3c a tew of the branches protruding from the ground. The Sibyl- %0a%3c line Books were accordingly consulted, and it was found that %0a%3c a war of extermination was impending, which would be at- %0a%3c tended with greater carnage the nearer it should approach the %0a%3c city of Home. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another kind of prodigy, too, is the springing up of a tree %0a%3c in some extraordinary and unusual place, the head of a statue, %0a%3c for instance, or an altar, or upon another tree even.^- A fig- %0a%3c tree shot forth from a laurel at Cyzicus, just before the siege %0a%3c of that city ; and so in like manner, at Tralles, a palm issued %0a%3c from the pedestal of the statue of the Dictator Cajsar, at the %0a%3c period of his civil wars. So, too, at Rome, in the Capitol %0a%3c there, in the time of the wars against Perseus, a palm-tree %0a%3c grew from the head of the statue of Jupiter, a presage of im- %0a%3c pending victory and trium])hs. This palm, however, having %0a%3c been destroyed by a tempest, a fig-tree sprang up in the very %0a%3c same place, at the period of the lustration made by the censors %0a%3c M. Messala and C. Cassius,^^ a time at which, according to Piso, %0a%3c an author of high authority, all sense of shame had been utterly %0a%3c banished. Above all the prodigies, however, that have ever %0a%3c been heard of, Ave ought to place the one that was seen in our %0a%3c own time, at the period of the fall of the Emperor Nero, in the %0a%3c territory of Marrucinum ; a plantation of olives, belonging to %0a%3c Vectius Marcellus, one of the principal members of the Eques- %0a%3c trian order, bodily crossed the public highway, while the fields %0a%3c that lay on the opposite side of the road passed over to supply %0a%3c the place which had been thus vacated by the olive-yard.*^ %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 39.

Some of these remedies may be applied to %0a%3c all kinds of trees in common, while others, again, are peculiar %0a%3c to some only. The methods that are common to them all, are, %0a%3c baring the roots, or moulding them up, thus admitting the air %0a%3c or keeping it away, as the case may be ; giving them water, or %0a%3c depriving them of it, refreshing them with the nutritious juices %0a%3c of manure, and lightening them of their burdens by pruning. %0a%3c The operation, too, of bleeding," as it were, is performed upon %0a%3c them by withdrawing their juices, and the bark is scraped all %0a%3c round^-' to improve them. In the \T.ne, the stock branches are %0a%3c sometimes lengthened out, and at other times repressed ; the %0a%3c buds too are smoothed, and in a measure polished up, in case %0a%3c the cold weather has made them rough and scaly. These re- %0a%3c medies are better suited to some kinds of trees and less so to %0a%3c others : thus the cypress, for instance, has a dislike to water, %0a%3c and manifests an aversion to manure, spading round it, pruning, %0a%3c and, indeed, remedial operations of every kind ; nay, what is %0a%3c more, it is killed by irrigation, while, on the other hand, the %0a%3c vine and the pomegranate receive their principal nutriment %0a%3c from it. In the fig, again, the tree is nourished by w^atering, %0a%3c while the very same thing Avill make the fruit pine and die : %0a%3c the almond, too, if the ground is spaded about it, will lose its %0a%3c blossom. In the same way, too, there must be no digging %0a%3c about the roots of trees when newly grafted, or indeed until %0a%3c such time as they are sufficiently strong to bear. Many %0a%3c trees require that all superfluous burdens should bo pruned %0a%3c away from them, just as we ourselves cut the nails and hair. %0a%3c Old trees are often cut down to the ground, and then shoot up %0a%3c again from one of the suckers ; this, however, is not the case %0a%3c with all of them, but only those, the nature of which, as we %0a%3c have already stated/^ will admit of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 40. METnonS of lEElGATIOIT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Watering is good for trees during the heats of summer, but %0a%3c injurious in winter ; the effects of it are of a varied nature in %0a%3c autumn, and depend upon the peculiar nature of the soil. %0a%3c Thus, in Spain for instance, the vintager gathers the grapes %0a%3c while the ground beneath is under water ; on the other hand, %0a%3c in most parts of the world, it is absolutely necessary to carry %0a%3c off the autumn rains by draining.

Care should be %0a%3c taken, too, to proportion it to the age of the tree, young trees %0a%3c being not so thirsty as older ones ; those too which require the %0a%3c most water, are the ones that have been the most used to it. %0a%3c Un the other hand, plants which grow in a dry soil, require no %0a%3c more moisture than is absolutely necessary to their existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 41, EEMABKABLE FACTS CONNECTED Willi IKKIGATION. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the Fabian district, which belongs to the territory of %0a%3c Sulrao'*'* in Italy, where they are in the habit, also, of irrigating %0a%3c the fields, the natural harshness of the wines makes it neces- %0a%3c sary to water the vineyards ; it is a very singular thing, too, %0a%3c that the water there kills all the weeds, while at the same %0a%3c time it nourishes the corn, thus acting in place of the wecding- %0a%3c hook.

In the elm, %0a%3c too, the superfluous juices are drawn off, by piercing the tree %0a%3c above ground to the pith when it is old, or when it is found %0a%3c to suft'er from an excess of nutriment. So, too, when the bark %0a%3c of the fig is turgid and swollen, the confined juices are dis- %0a%3c charged by means of light incisions made in a slanting direc- %0a%3c tion ; by the adoption of which method the fruit is prevented %0a%3c from falling off. When fruit-trees bud but bear no fruit, a %0a%3c fissure is made in the root, and a stone inserted ; the result of %0a%3c which is, that they become productive." The same is done %0a%3c also with the almond, a wedge of robur being employed for %0a%3c the pui-pose. For the pear and the service tree a M^edgc of %0a%3c torch-wood is used, and then covered over with ashes and earth. %0a%3c It is even found of use, too, to make circular incisions around %0a%3c the roots of the vine and fig, when the vegetation is too luxu- %0a%3c riant, and then to throw ashes over 'the roots. A late crop of %0a%3c figs is ensured, if the first fruit is taken off when green and %0a%3c little larger than a bean ; for it is immediately succeeded by %0a%3c fresh, which ripens at a later period than usual. If the tops of %0a%3c each branch are removed from the fig, just as it is beginning %0a%3c to put forth leaves, its strength and productiveness are greatly %0a%3c increased.

There is another %0a%3c species of gnat,^« too, that grows in the fig, which in its indo- %0a%3c lence and malignity strongly resembles the drone of the bee- %0a%3c hive, and shows itself a deadly enemy to the one that is of %0a%3c real utility ; it is called centrina, and in killing the others %0a%3c it meets its own death. %0a%3c %0a%3c Moths, too, attack the seeds of the fig : the best plan of getting %0a%3c rid of them, is to bury a slip of mastich," turned upside down, in %0a%3c the same trench.

Among the wild figs, the black ones, and %0a%3c those which grow in rocky places, are the most esteemed, from %0a%3c the fact of the fruit containing the most seed.

EKEOES THAT MAY BE COMMITTED IN PErNIITG, %0a%3c %0a%3c But, before everything, especial care should be taken that %0a%3c intended remedies are not productive of ill results ; as these %0a%3c may arise from either remedial measures being applied in ex- %0a%3c cess or at unseasonable times. Clearing away the branches is %0a%3c of the greatest benefit to trees, but to slaughter*" them this %0a%3c way every year, is productive of the very worst results. The %0a%3c vine is the only tree that requires lopping every year, the %0a%3c raj-rtle, the pomegranate, and olive every other ; the reason %0a%3c being that these trees shoot with great rapidity. The other %0a%3c trees are lopped less frequently, and none of them in autumn ; %0a%3c the trunk even is never scraped,^^ except in spring.

Some %0a%3c ])ersons are of opinion that the pomegranate should be watered %0a%3c four times a year with a mixture of human urine and watiT, %0a%3c at the rate of an amphora to each tree ; or else that the ex- %0a%3c tremities of the branches should be sprinkled with silphium" %0a%3c Bteeped in wine. The stalk of the pomegranate should be %0a%3c twisted, if it is found to split while on the tree. The fig, too, %0a%3c should be drenched with the amurca of olives, and other trees %0a%3c when they are ailing, with lees of wine ; or else lupines may %0a%3c be sown about the roots.

In addition to %0a%3c this, in the case of the olive and the fig, he recommends that %0a%3c a layer of straw should be first placed around them. In the %0a%3c fig, too, more particularly, he says that in spring the roots %0a%3c should be well moulded up ; the result of which is, that the %0a%3c fruit will not tall off while green, and the tree will be all the %0a%3c more productive, and not affected with roughness of the bark. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without any efficacy, beyond a doubt. %0a%3c " The action of salt upon vegetation is, at the best, very uncertain. %0a%3c %0a%3c These recipes are worthless, and almost inipnieticable. %0a%3c %0a%3c This method is still adopted, but with none of the accessories here %0a%3c mentioned by Pliny. . . j ^ j %0a%3c %0a%3c «" A dano-crous practice, Fee remarks, and certainly not to be adopted. %0a%3c 6' Mitior" Re llust. 93. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 534 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural HISTOHY.

Some give the name of " volucre"*^ to an insect %0a%3c which eats away the young grapes : to prevent this, they rub %0a%3c the pruning-knife, cxory time it is sharpened, upon a beaver- %0a%3c skin, and then prune the tree with it: it is recommended also, %0a%3c tliat after the pruning, the knife should be well rubbed with %0a%3c the blood of a bear.*' Ants, too, are a great pest to trees ; %0a%3c they are kept away, however, by smearing the trunk with red %0a%3c tarth and tar : if a fish, too, is hung up in the vicinity of the %0a%3c tree, these insects will collect in that one spot. Another %0a%3c method, again, is to pound lupines in oil,"® and anoint the %0a%3c roots with the mixture. Many people kill both ants as well %0a%3c as moles with amurca, and preserve apples from caterpillars %0a%3c as well as from rotting, by touching the top of the tree with %0a%3c the gall of a green lizard. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another method, too, of preventing caterpillars, is to make %0a%3c a woman,™ with her monthly courses on her, go round each %0a%3c tree, barefooted and ungirt.
