csum=Distillation of birch begins at 150-200c, and at 300c tar forms and distillates mostly [[acetic acid]] (wood [[vinegar]]) (50%25) and some [[methanol]] (30%25) and a bit of furfural (10%25) of total organic carbon [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253337329_Chemical_Composition_of_Birch_Wood_Slow_Pyrolysis_Products|#]].  All this is about 42%25 of dry weight of wood. Tar is 8-10%25 of the distillate.  Furfural is the pesticide.
