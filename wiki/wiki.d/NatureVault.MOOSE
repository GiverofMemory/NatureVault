csum=[[bee#moose|MOOSE Beehive]] is an example of design that gives you the drawings and solidworks assembly (open source) and uses only 2x4's (off the shelf) of only 2 different cut lengths and is compatible with the most popular hives (cross compatible), and assembly can be reduced to 5 modules, and the hives can be stacked horizontally next to eachother and potentially vertically (modular).
