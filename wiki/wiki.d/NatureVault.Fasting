csum=Fasting does cause heart and kidney problems [[ https://www.naturalblaze.com/2022/06/yo-yo-dieting-can-lead-to-long-term-heart-problems-raise-risk-of-diabetes.html|#]].  Towards the end of my 6 years in a christian cult where we were forced to do 2 day fasts every semester, my heart and kidneys were basically failing.  The fasting could have been a significant factor.  I also developed [[insomnia]] during this time which has lasted 13 years so far without a full nights sleep.  All that said, fasting is a tool for proving to [[God]] that you would sacrifice your life for what you are praying for.  And it does work.
