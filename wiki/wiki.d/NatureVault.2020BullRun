Elon also received a text a couple months ago originating from SBF of FTX about SBF giving elon money and elon was not liking it [[https://www.axios.com/2022/10/03/twitter-musk-sam-bankman-fried|#]] [[https://watcher.guru/news/elon-musk-calls-sbf-ftx-bullsht-offering-3-billion-twitter-deal?c=562|#]].  Did SBF see that elon was a big FTT holder and trying to appease him or posture, or did SBF already see he was going under and trying to jump ship from crypto into twitter ownership?  Binance announced on Nov 6th that they were going to unload FTT slowly but either them or a whale (SBF was probably also a big personal FTT holder who might have seen the writing on the wall) or a combination ended up dumping FTT (perhaps like a ouija game) to give the coin a nearly 95%25 drop on the yearly chart.  CZ confirms he did not cause the mass dump and he stopped his planned sales of FTT [[https://www.ft.com/content/4982c7e9-5dd7-4e99-9430-eface0db4a8c|#]] but perhaps he knew just the mention of what they were doing would cause whales to capitulate.  Coindesk originally broke the news [[https://finbold.com/ftx-billionaire-founder-bankman-fried-crypto-empire-splits-into-two/|#]] that FTX was built on shady foundations, who seems to be funded or linked to Coinbase.
