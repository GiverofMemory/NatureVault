text=The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a22. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba said: "In the first four words of the Torah, IN THE %0aBEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED Et - Beresheet Barah Elokim %0aEt, the first two words begin with the letter Bet, and the following two begin %0awith Aleph" (The letter Aleph is pronounced both as "A" and "E"). It is said %0athat when the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still %0aconcealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator %0agazed into the letters and played with them. %0a%0aIn the language of Kabbalah, the same sentence appears in the following %0away: when the Creator (Bina) decided to create the world (ZON of the world %0aof Atzilut), the Kelim of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva) were still in Bina. Hochma %0aand Bina (Aba ve Ima - AVI) are called 2,000 years. Before the creation of the %0aworld (the birth of ZON), all the letters (the Kelim of ZON) existed in AVI in %0athe form of MAN, and MAN always stimulates a desire in the Upper One to %0aattend to it. %0a%0aWith regard to the lower Partzuf, the Upper One is called the Creator, %0afor it truly begets it, and whatever the lower one receives, comes directly from %0aits Upper One. Moreover, one may say that this is all that the Upper One %0adesires, its entire existence is meant exclusively for the lower one. Therefore, %0athe Upper One always waits for the lower one's genuine request for the desire %0ato ascend spiritually, which is called MAN. Provided this desire is sincere, the %0aUpper One immediately responds and passes the powerful Light of correction %0ato the lower one. %0a%0aSince the lower one is ZON of the world of Atzilut, and all that is below %0athis Partzuf (all the worlds of ABYA and our world) is considered a part %0aof it, AVI of the world of Atzilut constitute the Upper Partzuf. The desires %0aand properties of ZON are called "letters," and here The Zohar explains the %0aproperties that ZON (the spiritual worlds and our world, we ourselves) were %0a%0a117 %0a%0a%0a%0a118 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0acreated with, which properties are desirable, which require correction, and %0ahow this correction is achieved. %0a%0aSince the properties of the future Creature are determined by the %0aCreator's purpose in creating it, it is said that even before the creation of %0athe world, the Creator played with the letters. The word "played" suggests %0athat the Creator's interaction with the Creature is like His game with the %0aleviathan (the legendary sea monster), with the property that is opposite %0afrom Him. At the end of correction all the letters unite and combine into %0athe one name of the Creator. %0a%0aThe order of the Hebrew alphabet indicates the descent of the Direct %0aLight from Above, the Inner Light that fills the Partzuf. The reverse order of %0athe letters from the end of the alphabet alludes to the ascent of the Returning %0aLight. The direct order of the alphabet refers to mercy, whereas the reverse %0aorder— to the strict law and restrictions on using egoistic desires. %0a%0aWhen Adam sinned, the letters detached themselves from him, and only %0athe letters Shin and Tav (the Kelim for the Light of VAK of Nefesh) remained in %0ahim. The Kelim for the Light of Neshama are represented by the letters from %0aAleph to Yod; the letters from Yod to Ku/ are the Kelim for the Light of Ruach, and %0athe letters Kuf and Reish— the Kelim for GAR of Nefesh— disappeared from him. %0a%0aThis is why Adam gave his son, born after his sin, the name SHeT(Seth): Shin- %0aTav, according to the two last letters of the alphabet— the Kelim that remained %0ain him. The Kli Shin-Tav are only fit for the Returning Light from below %0aupwards, but not for the reception of the Upper Light from Above downwards. %0aHowever, after it receives Yesod of Zeir Anpin (the letter Yod), Shin-Tav turns into a %0acombination Shin- Yod- Tav. And if the Creator creates the world by the letter Bet, %0ait then enters between Shin and Tav and forms the word Shahhat (Sh-B-T), the %0astate of spiritual perfection, the goal of creation. For this reason, the first word %0ain the Torah— Beresheet consists of: Bara (created) Sh(in)-Y(od)-T(av). %0a%0a23. When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet %0acame to Him in reverse order from last (Tav) to first (Aleph). The letter Tav %0aentered first and said, "Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, %0ato create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your %0aring, called EmeT (truth), that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You %0aare called truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with %0athe letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties." %0a%0aThe Creator answered: "You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit %0athe world that I conceived to be created by your properties, since you are %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a119 %0a%0a%0a%0adestined to be marked on the foreheads of the truly faithful who fulfill all %0aof Torah from Aleph to Tav (from the first letter to the last), and perished %0abecause of you" (Talmud Bavli, Shabbat, 55) %0a%0aWhat does a particular name of the Creator mean? The name of the spiritual %0aobject indicates the way one can receive the Light that fills it, the way one can %0aattain its spiritual degree. Generally speaking, the twenty-two letters are the ten %0aSefirot-Kelim in the Ibur (embryonic phase) of the future Partzuf in the Sefira %0aYesod, for that is where the screen of the embryo of the new Partzuf is located. %0aThat is why Yesod is called a "number," as it measures the size of a new Partzuf. %0a%0aBearing in mind that each name determines specific spiritual properties %0aand states of an object, one can understand what is meant by a change of name, %0aplace, or action. %0a%0aHaVaYaH is the basis of all the letters, but the filling of each letter clarifies the %0aletter itself. The filling of a letter is heard as the letter is pronounced. As we read %0athe letter Yod in the word HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey), we actually pronounce %0athree sounds (y-o-d); although we write only one letter, the sounds "o-Vav" and %0a"d-Dalet" are heard together with the sound "y." When we say "Hey," the sound %0a"ey"— Yod or "ey"— follows the sound "h." Therein lies the clarification of the %0aname HaVaYaH in the process of its emergence. %0a%0aThe Creator's form-properties are revealed in His deeds; hence, the three %0alines in Bina (the Creator) are imprinted and act in His created beings (the lower %0aworlds) as a seal and its imprint. Therefore, the name MB exists in Bina, as well %0aas in ZA and Malchut. However, in ZA, this name is divided into the ten sayings %0aand thirty-two forces of creation of Elokim, which create Malchut, the creature. %0a%0aBina is designated by the letter Mem, Malchut— by Bet; the name MB designates %0athe creation of Malchut by Bina. The letter Aleph designates ZA, which passes all %0athe twenty-two letters (from Ale£>h to Tav) to Malchut (Bet). This is why Malchut %0ais called ET (Aleph pronounced as 'E'-Tav). %0a%0aMalchut is the central part of creation and its purpose. She is the only %0acreation and includes all the worlds with all that inhabits them, us included. %0aDepending on its states, parts of Malchut or Malchut herself (which is one and %0athe same) have different properties designated by the different letter combina- %0ations. For this reason, Malchut's parts receive various "codes" (combinations) %0aof letters (properties) or names. %0a%0aAll the words in the world originate here, in Malchut. There is not a %0asingle property in the world that is not included in Malchut. Each property of %0aMalchut, each of the creatures (for all creatures are her parts) is designated by %0a%0a%0a%0a120 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe property that distinguishes it from the others, by the unique set of letters- %0aproperties that forms its name. %0a%0aMalchut is called Shechina (Divinity), as she is filled with the Light, Shochen %0a(Dweller— the Creator). The Creator is called Shochen when Malchut feels Him %0aas such, within her. If man, being part of Malchut, purifies himself of egoism, %0aeither partially or completely, and thus fills his corrected desires with the Light %0a(the Creator), he becomes part of the Shechina. %0a%0aMalchut consists of four parts that are named by their properties (also called %0afaces): face of a lion, face of an ox, face of an eagle, and face of a man. Alternately, %0aMalchut is likened to a spiritual kernel, surrounded by four shells, which corre- %0aspond to the four Klipot (impure forces): Ruach Se'ara (Stormy Wind), Anan Gadol %0a(Great Cloud), Esh Mitlakachat (Blazing Flame), and Noga (Radiance). %0a%0aKabbalah can describe spiritual actions either as names of Sefirot and %0aPartzufim or as names of HaVaYaH, EKYEH, and so forth, with their fillings %0aand Gematriot (plural for Gematria— the numeric value). Although the most %0afrequently used language is that of Sefirot and Partzufim, sometimes the %0alanguage of HaVaYaH with its fillings can also be applied, even in parallel or %0asimultaneously with the former. %0a%0aMost Kabbalistic terms are composite: Maatzil (the Creator) comes from the %0aword Tzel (shadow), as the Creature emerges from the Creator's concealment, %0afrom His restrictions. Another name for the Creator is Boreh (combination of %0aBo— come and Re 'eh— see). %0a%0aA name denotes attainment. Upon attaining an object, man gives it a %0aname. Similarly, man gives a name to the Creator according to the property %0athat he attains, depending on how he feels the Creator. There are several %0akinds of names to the Creator, based on His properties. For example, the %0aCreator's name EMET— "Truth" is based on the sensations of His Light within %0athe Partzuf. %0a%0aBelow are the names of the Creator with the corresponding names of %0athe Sefirot: %0a%0a- Keter: Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey (EKYEH) %0a%0a- Hochma: Yod-Hey (YA) %0a%0a- Bina: HaVaYaH with the punctuation Segol-Holam-Hirik, as Elokim: Yod %0a%0a(Yod-Vav-Dalet) - Hey (Hey-Yod) - Vav (Vav-Ahph-Vav) - Hey (Hey-Yod). %0a%0a- Hesed: Aleph-Lamed = EL (pronounced KEL) %0a%0a- Qevura: Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem (ELOKIM) %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a121 %0a%0a%0a%0a- Tifferet: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey (HaVaYaH without punctuation) %0a%0a- Netzah: HaVaYaH TZEVAOT %0a%0a- Hod: ELOKJM TZEVAOT %0a%0a- Yesod: Shin-Dalet-Yod = SHADDAY %0a%0a- Malchut: ADONAY (pronounced ADM) %0a%0aMerging the two worlds, the Upper and the lower, is designated by the %0awords HaVaYaH- ADM, implying the ascent of Malchut-ADM to the level of %0aBina-HaVaYaH with the punctuation of Elokim. %0a%0aThe name ZA of HaVaYaH comes from the right line (Hesed), and the name %0aADNI, from the left line (Gevura). Joining of these two lines forms the middle %0aline, where the Light of Hochma shines on account of the presence of the Light %0aof Hassadim from the right line. Such state is designated by a combination of the %0atwo names Ha VaYaH-ADM: %0a%0aYOD-Aleph-HEY-Dalet-VAV-Nun-HEY-Yod. The union (Zivug) of ZA and his %0aNukva is designated by mixing the two names. %0a%0aHaVdYaH-ADM: Yod-Aleph-Hey-Dalet-Vav-Nun-Hey-Yod. The opening Yod %0aindicates the Light of Hochma in ZA, the Yod at the end refers to the passing of %0athis Light to Nukva. %0a%0aAs a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascended to Bina, and governs %0aBina and ZA with her desire. Since it is impossible to receive the Light of Hochma %0ain the three Sefirot—Bina, ZA, and Malchut, which are governed by Malchut's %0aegoistic desire, the Light of Hochma is absent in the Partzuf, and only the Light %0aof Hassadim is present. %0a%0aThis is designated in the following way: the letter Yod enters the word Light %0a(Ohr contains the letters Aleph- Vav-Reish, signifying the Light of Hochma), and %0aforms the word Avir (air, containing the letters Aleph- Vav-Yod-Reish), signifying %0athe Light of Hassadim. If the Partzuf returns to the Gadlut state, the letter Yod %0aexits it, and it is refilled with the Light of Hochma. Consequently, Avir (air) %0abecomes Ohr (Light). %0a%0aUnfilled HaVaYaH designates Partzuf Keter. HaVaYaH with the filling of %0aAB (72) designates Partzuf Hochma (AA). HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG (63) %0adesignates Partzuf Bina (AVI). Together, these three HaVaYaH form MB (42) %0aletters— the sacred name of the Light that corrects the souls by its influence on %0athe Kli, the screen. %0a%0aAll that was created is the desire to receive pleasure, which we call "creature." %0aOnly this desire was created, and nothing else. All the worlds and all that inhabits %0a%0a%0a%0a122 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athem, our world with everything within it, are but degrees of the desire to %0areceive pleasure. The intensity of the desire determines its place in the spiritual %0arealm, where all creation and our world— as its lowest point— are located. Man's %0aactual location (the world, his spiritual degree) determines the particular kind %0aof pleasure he desires, how he chooses to enjoy. %0a%0aIn order for the creature to emerge from the Creator, the Light emanating %0afrom Him must descend through four stages, whereas the fifth stage already %0aperceives itself as a separate and independent (from the Creator) desire to enjoy %0aprecisely the Light emanating from the Creator. %0a%0aUpon emerging from the Creator— a result of a sequential emanation of %0aHis Light— the desire to receive pleasure (Kli-vessel) also consists of five parts %0adesignated by the letters: the tip of the Yod, Yod, Hey, Vav, Hey. These five parts %0a(four letters) are called the Creator's name HaVaYaH, because the Kli gives the %0aCreator a name according to its sensation of Him, according to its sensation of %0athe Light that fills it. The Light that fills the Kli is called "filling." %0a%0aThe Kli created by the Creator is divided into five parts, called "worlds." %0aEach world is in turn divided into five more parts, called Partzufim (faces). Then, %0aeach Partzuf (singular for Partzufim) consists of five parts called Sefirot. In all, %0athere are 5x5x5= 125 spiritual objects or degrees from the lowest degree to %0athe Creator Himself. %0a%0aEach Partzuf consists of five parts (Sefirot), designated by a dot and four %0aletters: Keter-dot + Hochma-Yod + Bina-Hey + ZA-Vav + Malchut-Hey = HaVaYaH. %0aThe difference between each of the 125 Partzufim lies in the type of Light that fills %0athem, whereas the core of the Kli, the letters HaVaYaH, remain the same. A desire %0acannot appear unless the Creator's Light had previously passed through the five %0astages; only the fifth stage is considered a birth of a new creation (desire). %0a%0aThe whole universe (all the worlds) is nothing but the ten Sefirot or the %0aCreator's name HaVaYaH. %0a%0a%0a%0aSEFIRA %0a%0a%0aLETTER %0a%0a%0aPARTZUF %0a%0a%0aWORLD %0a%0a%0aLIGHT %0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aA dot, the tip of the letter Yod %0a%0a%0aGalgalta %0a%0a%0aAK %0a%0a%0aYechida %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aYod %0a%0a%0aAB %0a%0a%0aAtzilut %0a%0a%0aHaya %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aHey %0a%0a%0aSAG %0a%0a%0aBeria %0a%0a%0aNeshama %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aVav %0a%0a%0aMA %0a%0a%0aYetzira %0a%0a%0aRuach %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aHey %0a%0a%0aBON %0a%0a%0aAssiya %0a%0a%0aNefesh %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a123 %0a%0a%0a%0aA filling of HaVaYaH with Light is referred to as its revelation. Thus, the %0aletters emerge from the state of concealment when they are not filled. In all there %0aare five Partzufim: Keter (Galgalta), AB, SAG, MA and BON. The first— Partzuf %0aKeter— is the main one and the source of all the rest. Its ten Sefirot is plain (inner) %0aHaVaYaH, for each of the four letters of its HaVaYaH comes outside, revealing %0aa new Partzuf that clothes it. %0a%0aSo then, out of Partzuf Keter-Galgalta, from the letter Yod comes Partzuf %0aHochma (AB), from the letter Hey— Partzuf Bina (SAG), from the letter Vav— %0aPartzuf ZA (MA), and from the letter Hey— Partzuf Malchut (BON). Thus Partzuf %0aKeter is designated by plain HaVaYaH, and the Partzufim that clothe it are %0adesignated by filled HaVaYaH. The recording of HaVaYaH with the Light %0athat fills it is called Miluy (filling). For the purposes of brevity when naming %0aa Partzuf, the notion of Gematria was introduced. Gematria is the numerical %0avalue of the Light that fills the Partzuf. %0a%0aWisdom (Hochma) is called calculation (Heshbon), Gematria. A calculation %0ais made only in a place where Light is received: (i) a preliminary calculation is %0amade as to how much Light the Partzuf can receive for the Creator's sake; (ii) %0athe Light is received in accordance with the calculation; (iii) calculation of the %0areceived amount, called Miluy, Gematria. %0a%0aMalchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma without the Light of Hassadim, %0aand in that event, Hochma cannot shine in her. Then Malchut ascends to Bina %0aand becomes like an embryo inside of her, by which she receives the right %0aline— Hassadim. Upon joining the past and the present states, Malchut receives %0aHochma into Hassadim, and the Light of Hochma shines in her. All these actions %0aof Malchut are accompanied by calculations, called Gematriot. %0a%0aThe Gematria (numerical value) of the Partzuf unfilled with the Light, the %0aGematria of the empty HaVaYaH is as follows: %0a%0aHaVaYaH = Yod + He;y + Vav + Hey = 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26. The Gematria of a %0afilled HaVaYaH is formed by filling each letter; In Hebrew, each letter has a full %0aname: A-Aleph, B-Bet, etc.. Hence, there are four kinds of fillings in HaVaYaH: %0a1) AB, 2) SAG, 3) MA and 4) BON. %0a%0a1) HaVaYaH with the filling of AB: %0aYod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0aHey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0aVav. Vav + Yod + Vav = 6 + 10 + 6 = 22 %0aHey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%0a%0a%0a124 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIn all: 20 + 15 + 22 + 15 = 72 = AB, where "A" designates the letter Ayin = 70, %0aand not Aleph = 1. HaVaYaH filled with this Light is called Partzuf AB (Partzuf %0aHochma), for the letter Yod with its filling signifies the Light of Wisdom, Ohr %0aHochma. Such a filling is called "HaVaYaH with the filling of Yod." %0a%0a2) HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG: the Partzuf that is filled with Light of %0aMercy, Ohr Hassadim, is called SAG, for its Gematria is this: %0a%0aSAG = Samech (60) + Gimel (3) = 63: %0aYod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0aHey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0aVav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 %0aHe?: Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%0aIn all: 20 + 15 + 13 + 15 = 63 = Samech + Gimel = SAG %0a%0aIf the Kelim and their filling originate from the first restriction, the letter %0aYod is present in the filling of HaVaYaH. And if the Kelim are filled with the %0aLight of the second restriction, it is the letter Aleph, present in the filling of %0aHaVaYaH. The difference between the Gematriot of AB and SAG lies in the %0afilling of the letter Vav. Gematria of Vav in Partzuf AB is twenty-two (from the %0afilling of Ohr Hochma), whereas Gematria of Vav in Partzuf SAG is thirteen (from %0athe filling of Ohr Hassadim). From the aforesaid, it is clear that Partzuf AB %0aoriginates from the first restriction, whereas the letter Vav (ZA) in Partzuf SAG %0aoriginates from the second restriction. %0a%0a3) HaVaYaH with the filling of MA: %0aYod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%0aHey: Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%0aVav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 13 %0a%0aHey. Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%0aSuch a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 6 + 13 + 6 = 45 = Mem (40) + Hey (5) = %0aMA (the letter Hey is pronounced as "ah"). %0a%0a4) HaVaYaH with the filling of BON: %0aYod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%0aHey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0aVav. Vav + Vav =12 %0aHey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a%0aSuch a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 52 = Nun (50) + %0aBet (2), pronounced as BON for easier articulation. This is the Gematria of %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a125 %0a%0a%0a%0aPartzuf Malchut, and it is equivalent to twice the value of the unfilled HaVaYaH: %0aHaVaYaH = 26, and 26 x 2 = 52 = MA. %0a%0aPartzuf Malchut cannot receive the Creator's Light due to the absence of a %0ascreen. Instead, it can only passively receive what Partzuf ZA gives it. Hence, the %0atwofold twenty-six indicates that whatever Malchut has comes to her from ZA. %0a%0aFrom the four kinds of HaVaYaH, it becomes clear that the root of creation %0ais neither Partzuf Hochma nor Bina, but only ZA, as it is the first Partzuf built on %0athe second restriction. %0a%0aThe primary ten Sefirot are located in Partzuf Keter, whereas Partzufim AB, %0aSAG, MA, and BON are merely branches stemming from the first Partzuf. %0aHowever, when the Light spreads within the Partzuf, it contains five inner %0aLights NRNHY and five outer Lights. The five outer Lights of Bina come out %0aof the right ear, and the five inner Lights of Bina come out of the left. The five %0aouter Lights of ZA come out of the right nostril, and the five inner Lights of %0aZA come out of the left. %0a%0aSince the two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) are remote from one another, %0aas a branch in our world, man's ear holes are also separated and distanced. The %0atwo nostrils are separated by a smaller distance, whereas the five inner and outer %0aLights of the common Light of the Peh (mouth) come out of the same opening. %0aThus, as they exit the mouth, they collide and interweave, and as a result of their %0acollisions, letters (Kelim) are born. %0a%0aSince twenty-two letters originate from Bina-SAG = Samech + Gimel = 60 + %0a3 = 63, the opening through which they come out is called 63 + 22 = 85 = Peh + %0aHey = PeH (mouth). The letters come out of the Peh of ZA, for Yesod of Ima is %0alocated there. %0a%0aWe received our entire Torah, all of the knowledge about the spiritual %0aworlds, from our Great Patriarchs, who ascended spiritually above our world, %0asensed the Upper Worlds, and described them to us. This is how we received the %0awhole Torah— both the written and the oral parts. %0a%0aWe cannot imagine the spiritual world because our sensory organs cannot %0adetect it. Thus, to describe the objects and concepts still unattainable by us, %0aKabbalists use several techniques, languages. The whole Torah speaks only %0aof the creation, governing, and correction of the world; never about history, %0ageography, or anything else. As it is said in the Torah itself, the Torah is the %0asacred names, that is, manifestations of the Creator, the degrees and methods %0a%0a%0a%0a126 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0ajbalists, those who ascend to the spiritual world and thus establisl %0ar, convey this information to us using four langua %0a%0aage of the TaNaKh (Torah— Pentateuch, Nevi'im— Pre %0aets, Ketuvim— Writings/Hagiographa). This is the language of tl %0awritten Torah. %0a%0a2. The language of laws. %0a%0a3. The language of legends, %0alanguage of Sefirot and Partzufim— the language of Kabbalah. %0a%0alanguages speak about the same thing— the attainment of the ( %0aby us, those living in this world. For this is the sole purpose of our creation, and %0aaccording to the Creator's design, we must devote all of our physical, mental, %0aand spiritual abilities only to it. And if we were to aspire only to this, we would %0anaturally use our language only for this purpose. After all, everything that is %0aan to us is only for the fulfillment of this exclusive goal— the attainment i %0a)r, while still in this life. %0a%0awhy the first language mastered by humankind was %0aHowever, as they distanced from fulfilling their mission, humankind cor %0aother languages. All the other languages in the world have their inner meaning, %0atoo, but since their alphabets were not revealed to us by Kabbalists, we study the %0aspiritual forces depicted in the Hebrew alphabet, the source of all the others. %0a%0aEvery Partzuf is divided into two parts: right and left. The right part consists of %0aRamach = Reish - Mem - Chet = 248 parts (organs) filled with the Light of Hassadim; %0aand the left part consists of Shasah = Shin - Samech - Hey = 365 parts (tendons) %0afilled with the Light of Hochma. ZA is called a "voice"; he is generally the Light of %0aHassadim. But when he joins with Malchut, called "speech," Malchut receives the %0aLight of Hassadim with Hochma from ZA, and thus "speech" is formed. %0a%0aThe seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0anames of ZA originate from the 70 (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is called %0a"Heaven" and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also called Ruach, %0aowing to the Light of Ruach within them, which ascends to Bina (ears) and %0atransforms into sound: Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%0aThere is a difference between language and alphabet, as in our world there %0aare people who can speak, but cannot read or write. The most ancient spoken %0alanguage is that of the TaNaKh, which dates back to Adam. The language of laws %0aoriginated from it, followed by the language of legends. All of these languages %0acombined and each of them in particular are used in our holy scriptures. %0a%0aThe language of Kabbalah was the last to develop. It is the most difficult %0alanguage, since proper understanding of it requires sensing the spiritual categories %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a127 %0a%0a%0a%0athat this language narrates. Kabbalah is also the most precise language of all. It is %0athe only language that can accurately render all the spiritual information. %0a%0a%0a%0alearn it and grasp its information. And since for many generations there %0awere only a few Kabbalists, unconnected with one another, the language of %0aKabbalah was the last to evolve. Even today it can only be "learned" directly %0a%0a%0a%0aInitially, Kabbalists enciphered their knowledge of the spiritual world as %0aletters, whose outlines reflected the interrelationships of spiritual forces. In %0aother words, each spiritual degree is characterized by a unique interrelationship %0aof spiritual forces. By assigning each spiritual property with a particular symbol, %0aone can depict the interrelationship, as well as the general product of the union %0aof spiritual forces of each degree, i.e., its essence. %0a%0aThus, Kabbalists created the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The %0aZohar pays much attention to analyzing the connection between the letters, which %0ahelps a student to synthesize his knowledge and find new ways of discovering %0aspiritual forces and their actions within. %0a%0aAs our forefather Avraham writes in his Book of Creation (Sefer Yetzira), letters %0arepresent the stones from which the building-word is constructed. As our sages %0atell us, the world was created with the letters of the "sacred language," each letter %0arepresenting a certain holy, spiritual, altruistic force of creation. %0a%0aThe properties of this force are reflected in the letter's outline, its %0aimportance with regard to other letters, its potential combinations with the %0aothers, its potential punctuation marks, its crowns and notations, its numerical %0avalue (Gematria) and variations. %0a%0aHowever, this only concerns separate letters and their combinations. There %0aare also certain rules that enable us to determine the properties of spiritual %0aforces not from letters, but from whole words. Moreover, quite often we can %0areplace letters or even parts of a word with similar ones. %0a%0aThe language itself, the roots of its words, indicate the properties of the %0aspiritual object they describe. For example, Adam originated from Adama— earth, %0awhich emphasizes his insignificance, and from the word Adameh— similar (to the %0aUpper One), which emphasizes his eminence. The name Yaakov comes from the %0aword Ekev— to get around (Esau). There are many such examples in the Torah, for %0aeverything is named after its root, as after the patronymic name of one's father. %0a%0aOnce we have established that certain combinations of letters (Kelim, %0alanguage of letters) can be used instead of the language of Sefirot and Partzufim %0a%0a%0a%0a%0athrough %0a%0a%0a%0a%0afrom a Kabbalist-teacher. %0a%0a%0a%0a128 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0awhen describing spiritual actions, the entire description of the spiritual worlds %0aamounts to portraying objects and actions in the form of letters and their %0acombinations. This is how the whole of the Torah is written, in words. Thus, %0a%0aa) The shape of each letter and the elements of its structure indicate %0aall the properties and the general state of a spiritual object, Sefira, or %0aPartzuf, which this particular letter depicts; %0a%0ab) The order of letters in a word indicates the connection between %0aspiritual objects, Sefirot, and their shared properties and actions. %0aAttainment of a word's spiritual meaning signifies an ascent to the %0aspiritual level of the object. When that happens, he who attains %0ait becomes this very word, assumes its name. Man's name keeps %0achanging as he ascends the spiritual degrees; it is determined by %0athe degree he is on, as he assumes the name of that degree. It is %0atherefore said that everyone can become like Moshe, i.e., attain the %0adegree called "Moshe"; %0a%0ac) The word itself in its "corporeal" reading, its "corporeal" meaning %0aindicates the spiritual root and its branch— consequence in our world; %0a%0ad) A combination of words indicates an entire spiritual process, which, %0aas a rule, has a corresponding action (commandment) in our world. %0a%0aNames change depending on the aspect that requires clarification: %0a%0aa) By elements of Sefirot: %0a%0a%0a%0aKeter - has none %0a%0aHochma - fire %0a%0aBina - water %0a%0aZA - air %0a%0aMalchut - earth %0a%0a%0a%0ab) By colors: %0a%0aKeter - has none %0a%0aHochma - white - the basis of all colors %0a%0aBina - red - most prominent %0a%0aZA - green - most perfect %0a%0aMalchut - black - cannot be changed by any other color %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a129 %0a%0a%0a%0aColors are present only in the Guf (body) of the Partzuf, but never in the %0aRosh (head). These colors are projected onto Malchut from Above, and she passes %0athem on to all the lower ones. %0a%0ac) By lines: %0a%0aHesed - right - white %0a%0aGevura - left - red %0a%0aTifferet - central, includes all the colors - green %0a%0aQuite often, colors and elements are used instead of the names of Sefirot %0aand their properties: fire, water, air, earth (The Zohar, Vayera, item 32). Malchut %0ais called "earth," but Malchut that ascends with her properties to Bina is called %0a"earth of the Temple." In the Temple, the four sides of the world— Hochrna, Bina, %0aTifferet and Malchut join the four elements of the world— fire, water, air and %0aearth. Out of the two points of Bina and Malchut, which are joined together, the %0aCreator made one Partzuf— Adam. %0a%0aThe four foundations of the world, or the four sides of the world: %0a%0a%0a%0aFire %0a%0a%0aNorth %0a%0a%0aShuruk %0a%0a%0aLeft Line %0a%0a%0aGevura %0a%0a%0aAir %0a%0a%0aEast %0a%0a%0aHirik %0a%0a%0aMiddle Line %0a%0a%0aTifferet %0a%0a%0aWater %0a%0a%0aSouth %0a%0a%0aHolam %0a%0a%0aRight Line %0a%0a%0aHesed %0a%0a%0aEarth %0a%0a%0aWest %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut- receives from all %0a%0a%0a%0aFour fundamental metals are created as a result of a Zivug of the four %0afoundations with Malchut; gold, silver, copper and iron. All of these names, as %0awell as many others, are used in the Torah instead of the names of the ten Sefirot. %0aTherefore, although the languages of the Torah, legends, the Talmud, and the %0aScriptures are extraordinarily vivid, only the concise language of Kabbalah %0aprovides an accurate description of the spiritual worlds. %0a%0aThe four kinds of symbols used with letters: %0a%0aTaamim— tone modulations used in pronouncing letters— signify the Direct %0aLight, which spreads from Above downwards in the body of the Partzuf. %0a%0aNekudot— letter punctuation marks— signify the Light during its gradual exit %0afrom the body of the Partzuf from below upwards. %0a%0aTagin— crowns above the letters— represent Reshimot (reminiscences/records) %0aof the previously present Light (Taamim). Tagin originate from GAR de Bina. %0a%0a%0a%0a130 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aOtiot— letters— represent Reshimot of the Light's exit from the body of the %0aPartzuf (Nekudot). Letters originate from Zat de Bina. %0a%0aThe ten Sefirot are divided into three primary parts— Taamim, Nekudot, %0aand Otiot: %0a%0aTaamim - Keter %0a%0aNekudot - Hochma %0a%0aOtiot - ZAT de Bina and ZON %0a%0aAccording to the Light in them, Sefirot are divided into: %0a%0aTaamim - Hochma %0aNekudot - Bina %0aOtiot - ZON %0a%0aThe letters were created in the following order: the letter Aleph, which was %0ainitially on the right side, begot the letter Shin, which emerged from it and %0amoved to the left side. The letter Shin consists of three sides: the left, the middle, %0aand the right. The letter Vav is thereby formed by three letters, and upon joining %0awith Aleph, it formed the word Aleph-Shin = ESH (fire) in the left side. %0a%0aOut of the interaction of the right and the left sides these two letters came %0aforth in contradiction between them, as the right line includes water, while the %0aleft line includes fire. Their collisions begot the letters Reish, Vav, and Chet, %0awhich formed the word Ruach (wind). This wind entered between the two sides %0a(fire and water) and joined them together, thereby establishing the order of the %0afirst letters and their perfection. %0a%0aAt first, The Zohar offers a general description of the three lines in ZA, %0adesignated by the three names of the Creator: El, Elokim and Elokeinu, and then %0aproceeds to clarify the descent of the degrees of filling ZA and Malchut with %0athe Light of Hochma in the form of letter combinations, in the order of the %0adegrees' descent from Above downwards. Mayim - water, Esh - fire, Ruach - %0awind constitute the three lines in ZA from AVI. This is why the first letters in %0aZA come from AVI. %0a%0aThen the following combinations emerged: Aleph revealed Mem from its %0aright side, so Mem stands to the left line of Aleph. Mem revealed Shin as the %0amiddle line, as Mem initially consists of the left line, for it exists in the form of a %0aconcealed letter Mem in the word Elokim, which pertains to the left line, and so %0aforth. This is how all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were born. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba 131 %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE LETTERS %0aOF THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a%0a%0a%0aLETTERS %0a%0a%0aNAME %0a%0a%0aPRONUNCIATION %0a%0a%0aGEMATRIA %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aAleph %0a%0a%0a[a], [e] %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0a3 %0a%0a%0aBet %0a%0a%0ab,v %0a%0a%0a2 %0a%0a%0aa %0a%0a%0aGimel %0a%0a%0ag %0a%0a%0a3 %0a%0a%0ai %0a%0a%0aDalet %0a%0a%0ad %0a%0a%0a4 %0a%0a%0an %0a%0a%0aHey %0a%0a%0a[a], [e] %0a%0a%0a5 %0a%0a%0ai %0a%0a%0aVav %0a%0a%0av, [u], [o] %0a%0a%0a6 %0a%0a%0aT %0a%0a%0aZayin %0a%0a%0az %0a%0a%0a7 %0a%0a%0an %0a%0a%0aChet %0a%0a%0ah %0a%0a%0a8 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aTet %0a%0a%0at %0a%0a%0a9 %0a%0a%0ai %0a%0a%0aYod %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a10 %0a%0a%0a(1)3 %0a%0a%0aChaf %0a%0a%0ah,k %0a%0a%0a20 %0a%0a%0a%3c? %0a%0a%0aLamed %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0a30 %0a%0a%0a(0)8 %0a%0a%0aMem %0a%0a%0am %0a%0a%0a40 %0a%0a%0a0)3 %0a%0a%0aNun %0a%0a%0an %0a%0a%0a50 %0a%0a%0aD %0a%0a%0aSamech %0a%0a%0as %0a%0a%0a60 %0a%0a%0aV %0a%0a%0aAyin %0a%0a%0a[a], [e] %0a%0a%0a70 %0a%0a%0a(1)3 %0a%0a%0aPeh %0a%0a%0ap, ph %0a%0a%0a80 %0a%0a%0a(r)s %0a%0a%0aTzadik %0a%0a%0atz %0a%0a%0a90 %0a%0a%0ap %0a%0a%0aKuf %0a%0a%0ak %0a%0a%0a100 %0a%0a%0a1 %0a%0a%0aReish %0a%0a%0ar %0a%0a%0a200 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aShin %0a%0a%0ash, s %0a%0a%0a300 %0a%0a%0an %0a%0a%0aTav %0a%0a%0at %0a%0a%0a400 %0a%0a%0a%0a13 2 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe letters Aleph and Ayin do not have any particular sound, and only %0athe accompanying punctuation mark determines their pronunciation. %0a%0aThe letters Bet, Chaf and Peh with a dot inside them are pronounced %0aas "b," "k," and "p." The absence of a dot changes their pronunciation to %0a"v," "ch" and "f." %0a%0aThe letter Hey is not pronounced, but rather aspirated. %0a%0aThe shapes of the letters Mem, Nun, Tzadik, Peh, Chaf (pronounced %0aMANTZEPACH) change when placed at the end of a word, as seen in the %0atable of letters. %0a%0aThe shape, external form of letters: the protruding element of a letter indicates %0athat the Light in this part of the letter is greater than in the other. The filling %0a(Miluy) indicates the height of the degree. A punctuation mark (Nikud) indicates %0athe origin of each part of the Partzuf. whether it came from the Upper Partzuf (and %0aconstitutes its part in the present one), from the lower Partzuf, or from itself. %0a%0aThe Kelim-Sefirot themselves are called "letters," and their punctuation %0amarks (Nekudot) indicate the Light that enters and exits them. The Light of Bina, %0aZA, and Malchut can enter the Kelim, but the Light of Keter or Hochma cannot. %0aA dot above a letter (Holam) signifies the Lights Keter and Hochma, which never %0aclothe the Kli, hence the location of the dot above the letter. %0a%0aTwo horizontally positioned dots (Tzere) allude to Sefirot Hochma and Bina, %0athat Bina does not receive the Light of Hochma, and contains only the Light of %0aHassadim, the Light of Mercy (AVI back-to-back). Bina herself is also called Tzere, %0afor ZA receives everything from her. If there is a third dot (Segol) between these %0atwo dots, it means that ZA raised his request for the Light of Hochma to AVI. %0aSuch a request of ZA in AVI is called Daat. Daat receives the Light of Hochma %0ain order to pass it on to ZA. The punctuation mark Kamatz (a "T" shaped mark %0aunder the letter) indicates that ZA collects (Mekabetz) the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aA dot indicates Malchut with a reflecting screen, but not a receiving one. %0aSuch a form testifies to the absence of Light in the Kli; it is merely a black dot, %0aas the law of restriction rules over it. %0a%0aThe Sefira Hod is an inclusion of Malchut's properties into ZA, out of which %0aZA makes a whole Partzuf Malchut. The letter Hey in the word Hod signifies Keter %0ain Malchut, and the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut are located among the impure %0aforces that cling to them. This is designated by an elongated leg of the letter Kuf %0a(dipping below the line), which indicates that the impure forces receive their %0astrength from the spiritually pure forces through this element, the Kuf. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a133 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe white background is a plain, indistinguishable and thereby imperceptible %0aLight (by us). Whatever we can distinguish may only be expressed by restricting %0athe diffusion of this white color. The forms and degrees of its restriction are %0acalled letters. That is why we see black outlines on white background, and attain %0aonly the black restrictions. %0a%0aWe can describe the diffusion of Light in the worlds using attraction and %0arestriction of the Light. And these two forces must act simultaneously. Similarly, %0awhen we perceive something in our sensory organs, we only sense it by way of %0arestriction, as the object's surface or a light wave collides with our sensory organ, %0awhich restricts its expansion, and can thereby perceive it. %0a%0aThe spiritual roots of the forms are as follows: A circumference originates %0afrom the first restriction of the Light in the world of Em Sof (Infinity), the %0afirst restriction on the diffusion of Light. Since this restriction was equal and %0auniform, it assumed the form of a circumference. %0a%0aA vertical line, length without width, signifies that the notion is unattainable %0aby us, and is therefore called a "thin line" of the diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0aThe Light of Hochma can only be received with the help of the screen in Malchut, %0awhich creates Returning Light that clothes the Light of Hochma. Therefore, the %0aUpper Light that comes to the Kli is called a line. %0a%0aA horizontal line, width without height: when a vertical line— the diffusion %0aof the Light of Hochma from Above downwards— collides with the screen, their %0acollision (of desires) compels the vertical line to shift into the horizontal line (to %0athe right), resulting in a shape of the English letter L. Its width is determined by the %0aforce of the Returning Light that ascends from the screen from below upwards. %0a%0aA rectangle is formed by the interlacing of the descending Light of Hochma %0aand the Returning Light: five vertical descending lines— five Sefirot of the Light %0aof Hochma and five horizontal lines from right to left— five Sefirot of the Light %0aof Hassadim. The size of the rectangle's side is called Amah, consisting of five %0aparts— Tefachim (plural for Tefach). (Both Amah and Tefach are distance measuring %0aunits.) This is why we describe the Kli as a rectangle. %0a%0aThe two kinds of diffusion of Light, the Light of Hochma and the Returning %0aLight, are called the right and the left cheeks, respectively, which turn into the %0aupper and the lower lips. Since, after the first restriction, the Light may not be %0areceived in Malchut, the Returning Light is only received in four parts of the Kli, %0anot in five. This is why there are 4 x 4 = 16 teeth on the lower jaw and 16 teeth %0aon the upper jaw (The Returning Light stems from resistance, from "chewing" %0athe Light before receiving it inside). %0a%0a%0a%0a134 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIn the second restriction, a Triangle is formed, as Malchut ascends to Bina %0aand forms a slanted line. Thus the combination of the Direct Light with the %0aReturning Light and restrictions beget various spiritual forms. %0a%0aThe Light of Hassadirn is defined as "protruding," for a protrusion beyond %0athe limits of a spiritual body means that: %0a%0a1) The Light is so great that it comes out by elevating, protruding %0athe limits; %0a%0a2) It originates from the middle line, Tifferet. %0a%0aA cavity in the body occurs due to the following reasons: %0a%0a1) The Light is insufficient; the Light cannot shine there; %0a%0a2) The Light of Hochrna is present, but the lack of Hassadirn prevents it %0afrom shining. %0a%0aPUNCTUATION MARKS %0aIN THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a(NEKUDOTj %0a%0a%0a%0aSefira %0a%0a%0aPunctuation Mark %0a%0a%0aPronunciation %0a%0a%0aKeter %0a%0a%0aKamatz %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0aT %0a%0a%0aa %0a%0a%0aHochma %0a%0a%0aPatach %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0aa %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aSegol %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0ae %0a%0a%0aHesed %0a%0a%0aTzere %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0ae %0a%0a%0aGevura %0a%0a%0aShva %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aTifferet %0a%0a%0aHolam %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0a0 %0a%0a%0aNetzah %0a%0a%0aHirik %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0ai %0a%0a%0aHod %0a%0a%0aKubutz %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0au %0a%0a%0aYesod %0a%0a%0aShuruk %0a%0a%0a%0a%0au %0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aNo Mark %0a%0a%0a□ %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aNekudot are defined by three lines: %0a%0aIN THE ROSH (HEAD) %0aKamatz - Keter - right line %0aPatach - Hochma - left line %0aTzere - Bina - middle line %0aHolam - Tifferet - middle line %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a135 %0a%0a%0a%0aIN THE GUF (BODY) %0aSegol - Hesed - right line %0aShva - Gevura - left line %0aShuruk - Tifferet - middle line %0a%0a%0a%0aIN THE EXTREMITIES %0a%0a%0a%0aHirik %0aKubutz %0a%0a%0a%0aNetzah - right line %0aHod - left line %0a%0aMalchut - middle line (has no designation) %0a%0a%0a%0aThe levels of Nelcudot: %0a%0a%0a%0aAbove the letters - Light of Neshama %0aIn the letters - Light of Ruach %0aUnder the letters - Light of Nefesh %0a%0a%0a%0aZivug de Nelcudot is the Zivug between Hochma de Aba and Hochma de Ima. %0a%0aZivug de Otiot is the Zivug between Bina de Aba and Bina de Ima. %0a%0aThe letters combined together designate Returning Light during the screen's %0aascent from Tabur to Peh. They are combined, for they all ascend to their root, %0awhich unites everything, whereas the use of the will to receive, even for the %0aCreator's sake, causes separation. %0a%0aA state of separated letters occurs when the Light enters the Kli (vessel, the %0aletters of HaVaYaH); the four letters thereby separate, since the Light makes %0aa distinction between the Sefirot: depending on their different properties, it %0aclothes in them in different ways. %0a%0aHaVaYaH with filling Aleph comes on a screen with Auiut Aleph (thickness %0aone), HaVaYaH with filling Hey comes on a screen with Aviut Bet (thickness %0atwo). A plain name refers to Aviut Shoresh (zero thickness) with the Light of %0aNe/esh. Plain letters refer to a Partzuf with a screen of Aviut Aleph. %0a%0aThe truly faithful, who believe in the three fundamentals: the Creator, His %0aProvidence and the Torah, need the two lines to be in constant balance for their %0aspiritual advancement. The left line is wisdom, the Light of Hochma that enters %0athe desire to receive, which pertains to the left side, and the right line is faith, %0athe Light of Hassadim (mercy), the altruistic desire to bestow. %0a%0aExisting in knowledge only means that man is under the rule of the %0aimpure forces (Klipa) of the left side, which renders him totally unable to %0afeel the spiritual, leaving him in spiritual darkness. Alternately, existing only %0ain faith means that man is under the rule of the impure forces (Klipa) of the %0aright side that convinces him that he has achieved perfection, that there is %0a%0a%0a%0a136 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0anothing else to work on, nothing to correct within him. This, too, denies him %0athe opportunity to advance. %0a%0aThe Zohar continues: And the Creator answered further (the letter Tav): %0a"The word MaveT (death) ends with you. And since these are your properties, %0ayou are not suitable for Me to create the world with you." Immediately following, %0athe letter Tav departed from Him. %0a%0aThe moment the Creator set about creating the world-ZON by selecting %0atheir properties, all twenty-two letters of ZON appeared before Him, starting %0afrom the last— Tav, and ending with the first, Aleph— the head of all letters. The %0areason for the letters coming in reverse order is that they constitute the MAN %0aof ZON, the Kelim of ZON, which emerge from below upwards. The usual %0aalphabetical order corresponds to the Light (MAD), which descends from %0aAbove downwards. But the order of MAN is opposite to that of MAD, for it %0aascends from below upwards. %0a%0aLetters are none other than desires, properties, and thoughts that, in man's %0aopinion, are suitable for the attainment of the spiritual, the Creator, of His %0aProvidence. Man skips from one thought to another: one moment he thinks that %0ait is possible to attain the Upper Worlds with one property, next he believes he %0acan enter the spiritual realms by mastering another property, then he begins to %0astubbornly observe all the commandments and pray zealously, or disregards all %0athe actions and plunges into contemplation and reading. Sometimes he craves %0aonly knowledge, and sometimes only faith, right down to fanaticism. %0a%0aJust as there are two extremes in our world— knowledge and faith, in the %0aspiritual world, as man now consciously ascends the spiritual ladder to the %0aCreator, there is spiritual work in the attainment of knowledge and faith. %0aHence, Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag's commentary on The Zohar is entitled The %0aSulam (The Ladder). %0a%0aEach of the twenty-two Hebrew letters represents a certain property. At times %0ait seems that the property of the letter Tav is suitable for the attainment of the %0aspiritual; at times he believes that some other letter is more appropriate. This %0aoccurs because in the process of his spiritual ascent, man begins to increasingly %0aunderstand the true Goal of creation and the Creator, which is exactly what is %0ademanded of him. %0a%0aThus, he continues to sort through it all, until his search yields the truth: %0aonly with the help of the letter Bet, which stands at the beginning of the word %0aBerachah (blessing)— contact with the Creator,— only with the help of this force %0acan one achieve the goal. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a137 %0a%0a%0a%0atuaiiy %0a5 into %0atually %0a%0a%0a%0aTherefore, The Zohar tells us how the letters— properties, forces, and desires- %0acome to the Creator. By offering up his prayer (MAN), man asks for some %0aproperty that seems like a real goal to him. And each letter tries to prove that %0ait is best suited for the attainment of the sensation of the Creator and merging %0awith Him. But the Creator shows that the best and the only letter is Bet, as only %0ait can help man to establish contact with Him. This is why the Torah begins %0awith this letter. %0a%0aThe description of the spiritual forces designated by each letter is incredibly %0adeep, and in order to attain full clarity we need to bridge several other preliminary %0aexplanations: the creation of the world includes its existence and process of %0aperfection so that the world could attain the goal for which it was created. %0a%0aThe Creator created the world consisting of two contrasting forces; against %0aeach pure, altruistic force, He created an impure, egoistic one, which is its equal %0aand opposite. Just as there are four pure worlds ABYA, the Creator created %0aopposite them four impure worlds ABYA. %0a%0aTherefore, in our world— the last degree of the world of Assiya— a spiritually %0alved person that senses the Creator and has entered with his properties %0apiritually pure world, looks no different from an egoistic and spirit %0adeveloped person, who has not attained the spiritual realm. This means tha %0aone who does not perceive the spiritual is totally unable to differentiate between %0apiritual purity and impurity. %0a%0aWe see that in our world one cannot advance with the help of the pure %0aforces. On the contrary, it is his egoistic aspirations that provide man with the %0astrength to conquer everything in the world. How often do we see fervent fanatics %0aimmersed in their impure desires to capture for themselves both this world and %0athe next, whereas one that aspires to the Creator has no strength for even a %0aslightest spiritual movement! In our world there is no proof or confirmation %0athat man advances on the right path. And under no circumstances should one %0adraw conclusions based on one's life experience or "common sense." %0a%0aSo how can a person in this world exist and advance towards the Goal of %0acreation if he is unable to tell good from bad, pure from impure? There is one %0asign by which one can distinguish purity from impurity: impure forces bear %0ano spiritual fruit. Thus, those that advance through the impure worlds ABYA %0ado not attain anything spiritual, whereas those who are connected to the pure %0aforces reap spiritual fruit on their path. %0a%0aAs it is explained in the "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot" (items %0a19-23), if man advances along the right path, he attains the secrets of the Torah in %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a5 %0a%0a%0a%0a138 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0afive years. The Creator helps those who wish to acquire altruistic i %0aabove their own requests, and thus one attains the desired goal, %0abelow, man aspires to the Creator with his small desire (MAN), and from Above, %0athe Creator pours onto him tremendous spiritual desires and strength (MAD). %0a%0aThis is the only opportunity to check whether or not the path that one %0ais on is correct, whether it leads to altruism or to even bigger egoism. By no %0ameans can one consider his well-being, soaring elation, his happiness and %0a:cess in life as proofs of correct advancement. It is precisely in those state %0aperfection, well-being, and contentment that he must ask himse %0alined the secrets of the Torah?" And until he has attained them, %0a%0a%0a%0a%0ae states %0alimself: %0a%0aem ' h ' S %0a%0a%0a%0aMa %0a%0a%0a%0aan %0a%0a%0a%0ais impure. %0a%0ashould always strive for the middle line— a balance of faith and %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aknowledge— in the following three notions: the Creator, His Providence, and %0athe Torah. And under no circumstances should he advance by either faith or %0aknowledge alone. If he only wants to attain the Creator, His Providence or the %0aih, he enters spiritual darkness, for it is impossible to receive the Light ■ %0a%0aLight of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim). %0a%0a; referred to as the left impure force, "Klipat Esau." %0astrives to advance through faith alone, he enters the impure force of the %0aside, "Klipat Yishmael," which tells him he is in a state of perfection. In this ca %0ahe sees no point in his work and is thus unable to continue to advance. %0a%0aIn other words, even if one is full of joy, which is exactly what the Torah %0aurges him to feel (to perceive the Creator's Providence with joy, for joy signifies %0ajustification of creation, understanding that His Providence is always just and %0aunless he has attained the secrets of the Torah, his path is consider %0aintention "for the Creator's sal %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThis article explains the particular properties of the Hebrew letters— how all %0athe letters come before the Creator, each asking Him to create the world with its %0aproperty. Each of the twenty-two letters represents a spiritual degree in the worlds %0aABYA, and each believes that its pure spiritual properties are most suitable for %0athe task, that by attaining its degree and acquiring its properties, the inhabitants %0aof the world will be able to elevate the pure forces over the impure ones, so much %0aso that they will reach the end of correction, the Goal of creation. %0a%0aHowever, the Creator answers each letter that against it are the corresponding %0aimpure forces, and therefore man will be unable to properly separate the pure %0aforces from the impure ones, and afterwards, utilize the pure forces to achieve %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a139 %0a%0a%0a%0athe goal. This occurrence repeats itself until the appearance of the letter Bet, %0awhich represents the degree called "the Creator's blessing," against which there %0aare no impure forces of any kind. %0a%0aAnd the Creator consented to create the world with the letter Bet, with its %0aproperty; for it has no impure counterpart, only Bet presents an opportunity %0ato carry out an analysis between good and evil, to determine when man works %0afor himself and when he works for the Creator's sake. Therefore, only by its %0aforce, by its property can the world exist: so as to extract from the "mixture" %0aof one's desires only what's pure, and elevate them above the impure, down to %0acomplete eradication of the latter, and the consequent attainment of complete %0acorrection of one's nature. %0a%0aAs it follows from The Zohar, only the Creator's help, called "a blessing," is %0athe force of man's salvation, the only thing capable of freeing him from the rule %0aof the impure forces. And this force, called "blessing," descends only upon those %0athat advance along the right path. %0a%0aThe right path is a combination of three conditions: (i) one's efforts in %0aidying (only!) genuine Kabbalistic sources; (ii) contact with a true Kabbalist, %0aaccepts as his teacher; and (iii) contact with like-minded people, who %0aeek spiritual elevation. A more detailed explanation will be provided to serious %0astudents only. %0a%0aAll twenty-two letters are divided into three degrees: Bina, Zeir Anpin (ZA), %0aand Malchut, since there are no Kelim (letters) above Bina. Twenty-two letters in %0aBina are called "big," twenty-two letters in ZA are called "medium," and twenty- %0atwo letters in Malchut are called "small." %0a%0aEach of the three Sefirot of Bina, ZA, and Malchut are further divided into %0athree degrees: The twenty-two letters of Bina contain their own Bina, ZA, and %0aMalchut. Likewise, ZA has his own ten Sefirot, in which his Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0aalso contain twenty-two letters. The same applies to Malchut. %0a%0aThe twenty-two letters of each degree are divided into three types. The letters %0afrom Aleph to Tet (1-9) are considered units; these are the nine Sefirot of Bina. %0aThe letters from Yod to Tzadik (10-90) are considered tens; these are the nine %0aSefirot of ZA. And finally, the four letters Kuf, Reish, Shin and Tav (100-400) are %0aconsidered hundreds; and these are the four Sefirot of Malchut, since Malchut is %0alocated below and downwards of Chazeh de ZA, which corresponds in height to %0athe four Sefirot of ZA. %0a%0aBina, units, big letters, nine letters: Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Hey, Vav, %0aZayin, Chet, Tet. %0a%0a%0a%0a140 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aZA, tens, medium letters, nine letters: Yod, Chaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Sarnech, %0aAyin, Peh, Tzadik. %0a%0aMalchut, hundreds, small letters, four letters: Kuf, Reish, Shin, Tav. %0a%0aHowever, it is known that units are in Malchut, tens are in ZA, and hundreds %0aare in Bina, which contradicts the aforesaid that units are in Bina, tens are in %0aZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. Such inverse dependence is caused by the %0ainverse relationship between the Lights and the Kelim: the lowest Light enters %0athe Highest Kelim. The Upper Kelim are the first to emerge, from Keter down to %0aMalchut (Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut), whereas the first to enter them %0ais the smallest Light, Ne/esh, followed by Ruach, Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida. %0a%0aTherefore, if there are only units in the Kelim, from Aleph to Tet, then only %0athe Light of Ne/esh is present. And if tens are added to the Kelim, the Light of %0aRuach appears, and if hundreds are added to the Kelim, the Light of Neshama %0afills them. %0a%0aThis is why hundreds are defined as Bina, tens as ZA, and units as Malchut. %0aHowever, with regard to the Kelim, the order is inversed: units are in Bina, tens %0aare in ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe letters descend from Bina to ZA and from there to Malchut. When they %0adescend from Bina to ZA, they descend as three lines: 22/3 = 7 letters in each, with %0athe remaining letter being added to the middle line. These twenty-two letters de- %0ascend in three lines to Malchut, which consists of five final letters MANTZEPACH, %0athereby bringing the total number in Malchut to 22 + 5 = 27 letters. %0a%0aThe middle line is called "Heaven," "firmament." Therefore, when The %0aZohar speaks of letters in the firmament, it means that the two middle lines, %0a7 + 7 = 14 = Yod + Dalet = Yad (hand) writes all the twenty-two letters in the %0afirmament (ZA) through the middle line. That is how one should interpret the %0awords of the Torah regarding the letters that appear in the sky or having seen the %0ahand that writes the letters in the sky. %0a%0aThe twenty-two letters of the Torah are the Kelim to be filled by the Light %0aof NRN. Units— from Aleph to Yod— are the Kli intended for the Light of Bina %0a(Neshama). Tens— from Yod to Kuf— are the Kli meant for the Light of ZA {Ruach). %0aHundreds— from Kuf to Tav— are the Kli for the Light of Malchut (Ne/esh). %0a%0a%0a%0aBina: Light (100) %0aZA: Light (10) %0aMalchut: Light (1) %0a%0a%0a%0aKelim (1) %0aKelim (10) %0aKelim (100) %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a141 %0a%0a%0a%0aLetters are the Kelim, into which the Light clothes; in all, there are twenty- %0atwo special properties, and thus twenty-two symbols of their description, %0acalled letters. Just as the combinations of the twenty-two letters suffice for the %0adescription of all existing knowledge, the various couplings, unions (Zivugim of %0aSefirot) of the twenty-two Kelim, properties, desires of the Partzuf are sufficient %0afor receiving and bestowing Light, fulfilling all spiritual actions and bringing all %0athe letters (man's desires) to correction. %0a%0aLetters represent the various correlations of ZON: %0a%0aa) ZA, consisting of six parts of his extremities, husband to Malchut, %0adesignated by the letter Vav, Sefira Yesod— level of an embryo; %0a%0ab) ZA designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Tifferet, consisting of six parts of %0ahis hands— level of nursing; %0a%0ac) ZA that stands between AVI, while Nukva must ascend to him, thereby %0areaching the level of reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%0ad) ZA, the letter Vav, above him are ten Sefirot Keter-Hochma, below him %0aare ten Sefirot Bina-Tifferet-Malchut—and together they make up the %0aletter Aleph. And the final corrected state will come when Malchut %0aascends to Keter of ZA (the Upper Yod in the letter Aleph) at the end %0aof correction. When Malchut ascends above Parsa (Vav), she receives %0athe Light herself, whereas when she descends below Vav, she receives %0afrom ZA. As Malchut ascends, she forms Taamim (tone marks), when %0ashe descends, she is called Nekuda (point), and when she merges with %0aZA, she is referred to as a point inside Vav (Shuruk). %0a%0aThe order of ATBaSH: There is a special combination of letters, e.g. the %0afirst with the last ('A' through 'T'), the second with the second last ('B' through %0a'Sh'), etc., which designate the conditions for diffusion of the Upper Light from %0aAbove downwards. %0a%0aMANTZEPACH: All the worlds and Partzufim were created with the %0atwenty-two letters of Malchut. The screen is located in the head of the Partzuf, %0apreventing the Light from entering. It repels the Light, calculates how much it %0acan receive for the Creator's sake, and only then accepts it. %0a%0aEach of the five levels of the will to receive that exist in Malchut, in the Guf %0aof the Partzuf, has a corresponding restriction in the screen, located in the Peh, %0ato prevent the Light from entering the body. Therefore, the screen in the Peh %0aconsists of five parts, forces. %0a%0a%0a%0a142 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThese five restrictive forces of the screen, five exertions of the screen are %0adesignated by the five final letters of the alphabet: Mem-Nun-Tzadik-Peh-Chaf %0a(abbreviated as MANTZEPACH). They are called "final letters" because they %0aare written only at the end of words. These forces determine the reception %0aof Light in the body of the Partzuf, and therefore beget the other twenty-two %0aletters (Kelim, corrected desires, which receive the Light). Although the five %0aletters MANTZEPACH are only found at the end of words, in oral speech they %0arepresent the five groups of pronunciation of the twenty-two letters. And the %0aletters MANTZEPACH stand at the head of each group. %0a%0aOut of the five letters MANTZEPACH originate five groups of sounds: %0a%0a1. Peh-Keter: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the throat; they are %0acalled AChHA—Aleph-Chet-Hey-Ayin. Aleph is the Light of Partzuf Keter of Atzilut, %0aconcealed from the lower ones and called Atik. Chet is the Light of Partzuf Hochma %0aof the world of Atzilut, called Arich Anpin and also concealed from the lower %0aones. Hey is the Light of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, called Ima (mother), %0awho receives the Light of Hochma from Aba (father) in order to pass it on to her %0achildren (ZON). Ayin is the Light of Zeir Anpin 's face. Since the Light of ZA that %0aenters Malchut is called "the Torah," it is said that the Torah has Ayin (70) faces, %0athat the Creator (ZA) has Ayin (70) names. After all, with regard to Malchut, ZA is %0athe Creator. Therefore, seventy souls descended to Egypt, and so forth. %0a%0a2. Chaf-Hochma-. a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the palate; %0athey are called GlChiK— Gimel-Yod-Chaf-Kuf. The letters AChHA transfer the %0aLight to the letters GlChiK: Aleph passes the Light to Gimel, which carries reward %0a(Gemul— Gimel) for the righteous. Chet passes the Light of Hochma to Yod, but this %0aLight is concealed. Hey illuminates Chaf with the Light of Bina, which carries %0ajoy. Ayin illuminates Kuf. Just as Ayin = 70, as it consists of seven Sefirot, Hesed- %0aGevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, each containing ten Sefirot of its own, %0aKuf = 100, as it consists of ten Sefirot from Keter to Malchut, each consisting of %0aits own ten. Hence, the palate fully complements the throat. %0a%0a3. Nun-Bina: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the tongue, called %0aDaTLaT— Dalet-Tet- Lamed- 'Nun-Tav. %0a%0a4. Mem-ZA: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the lips, called %0aBOMoCH-Bet-Vav-Mem-Cka/. %0a%0a5. Tzadik-Malchut: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the teeth, %0acalled ZaSSHRaTZ - Zayin-Samech-Shin-Reish-Tzadik. %0a%0aVoice and speech: Voice is formed in ZA, speech— in Malchut. If he who %0ais righteous, and who exists in the worlds BYA, raises his prayers (MAN) to %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a143 %0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut of the world of Atzilut, he causes ZON to ascend to AVI, and unites %0athem in a constant Zivug so as to assure the Light's descent to the lower ones. %0aZON receives the Light from AVI; this Light is called "voice" and "speech," %0aand this is the power of the righteous— to create the pure and destroy the %0aimpure with their voice. %0a%0aMan's speech is conceived in the lungs: as the air exits the lungs and %0areaches the mouth, it turns to voice, and as it leaves the mouth, it becomes %0aspeech. Two lips accept the voice from the two parts of the lungs (the left and %0athe right) and turn it into speech. Each lung consists of five parts so as to %0apass to the five parts in the mouth: to the guttural letters AChHA, the labial %0aletters BOMoCH, the palatal letters GlChiK, the lingual letters DaTLaT and %0athe dental letters ZaSSHRaTZ. %0a%0aThe seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0anames of ZA originate from the seventy (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is %0acalled "Heaven," and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also known %0aas Ruach (because of the Light of Ruach in them), which ascends to Bina (ears), %0awhere it turns to sound, with Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%0aTHE LETTER TAV %0a%0aEach of the twenty-two letters corresponds to a particular spiritual degree, on %0awhich it acts. The letter itself is that spiritual degree. Hence, the letter Tav claims %0athat its properties are the most suitable for the creation of the world, that its %0aproperties can bring the world to correction and to the goal of creation, for it %0adefines the property of "truth," the Creator's seal. %0a%0aThe impure forces exist solely on account of the miniature Light received %0afrom the pure forces; this Light is called Ner Dakik (tiny candle). Without this %0aLight, the impure forces would neither be able to exist nor to function— tempting %0aman with the pleasures they received from the tiny spark of Light that fell from %0athe pure Sefirot. Therefore, the last, lowest pure degree lets a little bit of the %0aUpper Light down to the impure forces. %0a%0aWithout the support of the pure forces, the impure forces would instantly %0adisappear. A question arises: who needs them to exist and what for? Obviously, %0athe impure forces were created on a par with pure ones by the Creator Himself, %0afor there is no other power in the entire universe besides Him. %0a%0aIt was necessary to create impure forces in order to concentrate them in %0athe enormous desires to receive pleasure, in immense egoism. The system of %0a%0a%0a%0a144 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0athe impure worlds of ABYA serves as a kind of storehouse of desires to receive %0apleasure, from which, to the extent of his correction, man can take more and %0amore new desires so as to correct them. Thus, by attaching uncorrected impure %0aforces to himself and correcting them, man can gradually ascend higher and %0ahigher, up to the level of the Creator. For this purpose the Creator created %0aimpure forces and sustains them through the system of pure ones. %0a%0aThe impure system of the worlds ABYA exists on the same level, parallel to %0athe pure one. Our world is located under these two spiritual systems. Our world %0ais also called egoistic and impure, but its forces and desires are so insignificant %0athat they are located below the worlds of the impure ABYA. %0a%0aWhen, with the help of Kabbalah, one surmounts the level of our world's %0aegoism, he enters the pure world of Assiya. And immediately after, the impure %0aworld of Assiya begins to influence him, tempting him with its false pleasures. %0aBy overcoming the temptations of the impure world of Assiya, one ascends %0aspiritually. But until one surmounts the impure desires of his body, of our %0aworld, he will not begin to sense, or enter the spiritual worlds, for he would not %0abe able to withstand the impure forces that act there. %0a%0aUnlike the forces that act in the spiritual world, man in our world is only %0ainfluenced by the small egoistic force called his "body," his ego. Man can struggle %0awith this force, either winning or losing his battles. But even if he is defeated, %0aman retains that tiny spark of Light (Ner Dakik), which sustains his existence. %0a%0aRabbi Yehuda Ashlag gives the following example: man's work in this world %0aresembles writing on a school blackboard, where any mistake may be wiped off %0alout harming the writer, where he can make corrections and write anew, %0ale learns to write correctly. Only when he learns to write correctly is %0ato enter the spiritual realm. %0a%0aTherefore, our world is the most insignificant of all. Everyone must begin %0ahere, and everyone is bound to return here, and be born again and again until %0ahe crosses the boundary between our world and the spiritual one. (There are %0amany additional conditions required for the soul to not descend to this world %0aanymore, and those who will merit, will understand). %0a%0aHence, the vertical line, the leg of the letter Kuf, descends below the writing %0aline, which signifies the Light descending through this letter down to the impure %0aforces. And no other letter descends below the writing line, like the Kuf does. %0a%0aFor the impure forces to exist (any creature, whether pure or impure, can %0aonly exist by receiving Light), the last, lowest degree of pure forces descends into %0athe impure forces and gives them the Light necessary for their existence and %0a%0a%0a%0a%0as anew, %0aly is he %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a145 %0a%0a%0a%0arealization of their role: to entice man with their pleasures and convince him to %0aact according to the law of the impure forces. %0a%0aAt first, the left leg of the letter Tav also descended below the writing line. %0aBut the Creator saw that the impure forces would then be too closely connected %0ato pure ones, so He severed this connection and returned the left leg of the %0aletter Tav back to the writing line, to the level of the pure forces. %0a%0aAs a result of this shortening, the left leg of the Tav doubled in thickness, %0aas it folded in two, and no Light passes to the impure forces anymore. On the %0acontrary, it even becomes the Creator's seal by holding the impure forces at bay %0aand preventing them from stealing the Upper Light, for as soon as any impure %0aforces touch it, they instantly die. %0a%0aAnd all the life-force necessary for the sustenance of the impure forces is %0apassed by the Creator through the letter Kuf, because, being the first letter of %0aMalchut, it is remote from them; thus, there is no fear or risk that its connection %0ato the impure forces would become too strong. %0a%0aMalchut consists of only four letters from Above downwards: Kuf, Reish, %0aShin, and Tav. Kuf is the first, Tav is the last, and below it are the impure %0aforces. Therefore, if they receive the Light they need according to the thought %0aof creation from Kuf, the furthest letter from them, the impure forces have %0ano way of "stealing" more Light than Malchut, who consists of four letters, is %0aobliged to give them. %0a%0aThis is why this letter is called Kuf, to show that it gives strength to the %0aimpure system of ABYA— a fake (nonexistent) man, just as a monkey (Kof in %0aHebrew) resembles a human being. %0a%0aAnd it misleads people by pretending to be the truth and claiming that its %0apath leads to the attainment of spirituality, the Creator, Lishma, the sensation %0aof the Creator. However, the pure forces maintain that only with the help of the %0aTorah can man attain adequate correction of his properties so as to merge them %0awith the Creator. %0a%0aAnd this is what the letter Tav claimed: because it is the Creator's seal of %0atruth, it stands at the end of the pure system and does not allow the impure %0aforces to cling to pure ones, and pose as if they are pure. This is why its %0aproperties are worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world— so %0athat via the analysis of good and evil, purity and impurity, inhabitants of this %0aworld may be sure that by acquiring its properties they will achieve the goal %0aof their creation. %0a%0a%0a%0a146 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe four letters Kuf-Reish-Shin-Tav make up the four Sefirot of Malchut of the %0aworld of Atzilut: Keter-Hochma-Bina-Tifferet, where Tifferet consists of six Sefirot— %0aHesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. But when the letter Kuf is by itself, without %0aReish-Shin-Tav, the Torah, which spreads to the worlds BYA, also shines upon the %0aimpure forces, and the angel of death receives the strength to destroy all that %0alives. This state is designated by the letter Kuf. But when Malchut is corrected, %0ashe is designated by the letter Hey, whose difference from Kuf lies in the long leg %0aof the Kuf (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%0aThis long left leg, which turns the Hey into Kuf, indicates that the Light %0adescends from the pure forces (Partzufim) to the impure worlds of BYA, the %0aimpure forces referred to as death. And when Malchut joins with Bina and %0areceives the strength from Bina to ascend and receive the Light, the other letters %0ajoin Malchut, and she draws the Light of life from Bina. %0a%0aIn this state, the left leg of the Kuf is reduced in half, turning the Kuf into %0aTav, whose left leg is twice as thick, due to its shortening. The part of Malchut %0athat passed Light to the impure forces now ascended out of them, hence there %0aare two kinds of Malchut: Miftacha (key)— the part that joined with Bina, and %0aMan'ula (lock)— the part that ascended out of the impure forces. %0a%0aThese two parts of Malchut manifest in different ways: Miftacha— openly and %0aMan'ula— secretly. Two paths of bringing man to correction emerge from them: %0athe good path of the Torah and the path of suffering. %0a%0aHowever, after Malchut corrects her properties and joins with Bina, she no %0alonger parts from Bina, but, upon receiving Light from her, Malchut pours it %0aonto the worlds, and the impure forces lose their strength to sow death and rule %0aover the world. And if a case arises where a sinner must be punished, the impure %0aforces must first receive permission to punish him, for without permission they %0amay not reveal the Man'ula. %0a%0aThus, after Malchut joins with Bina, thereby correcting her properties, the %0aimpure forces are no longer free to rule the world, unless they are permitted. %0aThe reason for this is the letter Tet, the last letter of Bina, which sends the Light %0aof life to all with the help of the Miftacha. After Malchut joins with Bina, she %0abecomes a Miftacha, and does not let go of this connection. Respectively, the %0aimpure forces, the leg of the letter Kuf, can no longer sow death. %0a%0aThree places emerge from this: (i) where only the properties of the letter %0aTet rule by shining with the Light of life of this world; (ii) the entire world after %0aMalchut joins with Bina, defined as Miftacha, when the letter Tet shines upon %0aall, but permits the punishment of sinners according to the rule: "You advance %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a147 %0a%0a%0a%0atowards the goal either by the path of the Torah or by the path of suffering"; (iii) %0ahell, the place of eternal punishment by the letter Kuf, in contrast with the first %0aplace, ruled by the letter Tet, where life is eternally prosperous. %0a%0aAll the letters with all their secret properties, described by those who %0aunderstand them, are located in the Temple. All the Upper and lower worlds %0aare created and function in the framework of their laws-properties, and the %0aSupernal Name, the Creator's name HaVaYaH rules over all. %0a%0aThe Mishkan (tabernacle) in the Temple was also designed with the help of %0aletters, for its builder, Betzalel, knew how to join the letters that made Heaven %0aand earth. And since he was unique in possessing this wisdom, he was entrusted %0awith the building of the sanctuary. %0a%0aAs the Creator chose Betzalel Above, so He wished him to be chosen below, %0aas He said to Moshe Above: "Choose Betzalel." So Moshe said to his people %0abelow: "The Creator has chosen Betzalel." For such was Betzalel's name-property %0a(Be Tzel El)— "In the Creator's shadow." %0a%0aThe Creator is called ZA or the Sefira Tifferet in Partzuf ZA, which shines %0aupon the Sefira Yesod, called Tzadik (righteous one). Betzalel is called Yesod, %0awhich receives the Light of VAK— an incomplete Light— from Tifferet, which is %0ahence called "sitting in the shadow," and, in turn, shining into Malchut. Thus, %0alike Tifferet, the Sefira Yesod that passes this Light also consists of six Sefirot: Hesed- %0aGevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. %0a%0aThe name of the letter Tav, "truth," indicates that in order to reach its %0alevel, its degree, one must attain the property of truth. Therefore, the letter Tav %0aclaimed that with its properties man can fully analyze good and evil, renounce %0ahis impure desires as false, and to the degree that he renounces them, draw %0acloser to the pure desires (forces), and thereby be certain that he will reach the %0agoal of creation— correction of all his desires (Gmar Tikkun, end of correction). %0a%0a%0a%0aruly ask Him for help." For only with His help can one achieve correctior %0aand spiritual elevation. However, this help only comes to those who genuinely, %0a"truly" demand it. As soon as man is able to cry out wholeheartedly for the %0aCreator's help, he instantly receives it. And if he does not receive an answer %0afrom the Creator— it is a sign that his request is not yet complete, that he did not %0ayet fully realize his egoistic nature and properties as worthless, has not yet fully %0afelt his helplessness and inability to exit and correct his properties by himself. %0aThis is why letter Tav was certain that once man acquires its property of truth, %0a%0a%0a%0a148 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aBut the Creator answered her that it is not worthy of becoming the basis %0aof creation, for the forces of judgment that would arise from it would be so %0astrong that even the complete righteous, who fulfilled the entire Torah from %0aAleph to Tav (A to Z) and reached the property of truth, will nevertheless be %0apunished by it, for they have not destroyed all the sinners, as it is written in %0athe Talmud (Shabbat, 55). %0a%0aFurthermore, the Creator declines its request, for it is also the seal of %0adeath, as its power brought death to this world. For man is bound to die, as the %0aserpent forged its seal and deceived Adam in his understanding of the Tree of %0aKnowledge. This is why the world cannot exist with its properties. %0a%0aTHE LETTER SHIN %0a%0a24. The letter Shin appeared before the Creator and said: "Maker of the %0aworld, it befits the world to be created with me, for Your own name Shadday %0abegins with me." The Creator replied: "You are fine, handsome, and truthful, %0abut since the letters (properties) of the word Sheker (falsehood) took you to %0abe with them, I cannot create the world with your properties, for SheKeR %0a(falsehood) exists only because the letters Kuf and Reish took you." %0a%0aMalchut consists of ten Sefirot and has two endings: %0a%0a1) If she has only her own properties, she contains all ten Sefirot, from %0aKeter de Malchut to Malchut de Malchut. In this case she firmly restricts %0athe diffusion of Light and is designated by the letter Tav; %0a%0a2) If Ima-Bina of the world of At^ilut fills Malchut with her Light, Partzuf %0aMalchut ends not in the Sefira Malchut, but in the Sefira Yesod, and is %0adesignated by the letter Shin. %0a%0aThe three tips of the letter Shin are called its crown and signify the Light of %0aBina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), which descends from Partzuf Ima-Bina %0ainto Partzuf Malchut. This Light of Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), %0acreates new altruistic properties in Malchut, altruistic intentions to receive the %0aLight for the Creator's sake, after which Partzuf Malchut can receive the Ohr %0aHochma (Light of Wisdom) from ZA (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 22). When bonded %0aso, ZA and Malchut are called "husband and wife," and the Light that Malchut %0areceives from ZA is called 'TOO blessings." %0a%0aThis new ending of Part^u/Malchut in the Sefira Yesod instead of in the Sefira %0aMalchut is therefore called Yesod de Nukva or "the central point of existence," %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a149 %0a%0a%0a%0afor all that exists in the world originates from it and exists thanks to it. Partzuf %0aMalchut is the sum of all the creatures, and we are all its parts. All the worlds %0aand all that inhabit them constitute various parts of Partzuf Malchut of the %0aworld of Atzilut. %0a%0aEach Upper Partzuf is considered the Creator of its adjacent lower Partzuf, %0afor the latter originates (born) from it. Therefore, in relation to all the crea- %0atures, Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut is considered and called "the Creator," %0aour Creator. %0a%0aAnd, like the Tav, the letter Shin is called "truth" and "the Creator's seal," %0afor a seal signifies the end of a spiritual object— Partzuf, like a seal fixed at the %0aend of a letter, written in the name of the Creator. The Creator's seal is similar %0ato Himself; this is why the seal is called the mark of truth, for only the pres- %0aence of a seal gives a letter the force of truth, and confirms the truthfulness %0aof its content. %0a%0aHowever, the significance of the letter Shin is greater than that of the letter %0aTav, for Shin is the first letter of the word Shadday, one of the Creator's names- %0aproperties, designating His power, by which He said "Dai" (enough) to creation- %0astop and do not descend further (Talmud, Hagigah, 12)— do not descend below %0athe letter Shin. %0a%0aThis reveals that the world and its inhabitants can only exist with the help %0aof the letter Shin, thanks to its property that restricts the diffusion of Light. %0aThe Creator said: "Stop, Creature, at the letter Shin, and do not spread to the %0aletter Tav," for if the Light had spread to Tav, the impure forces would have %0areceived such great strength that man would have no hope of escaping them and %0areaching altruistic properties. This is why the ending point of Shin is called "the %0acentral point of existence." %0a%0aTherefore, after the letter Shin saw the Creator refuse the letter Tav, precisely %0abecause ending the diffusion of Light with Tav creates conditions for correction %0aof the world that are too difficult for man to meet, the letter Shin claimed that %0aits property of Shadday is suitable for the creation of the world, and was certain %0athat the Creator would choose it— its properties— as the basis of creation, for %0ait possesses all the advantages that Tav lacked, which was the reason for the %0aCreator's refusal. %0a%0aAnd it has Tav 's advantage, as well: it is the Creator's seal— truth. Moreover, %0ait has an additional advantage: it is called by the name Shadday, the new ending %0aof Malchut for the inhabitants of the world, instead of the ending by the property %0a%0a%0a%0a150 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aof the letter Tav. Based on all that, the letter Shin found the strength and courage %0ato appear before the Creator with the proposition to create the world with it. %0a%0aBut the Creator answered that precisely because of Shin's additional %0aadvantages compared to those of the letter Tav, the impure forces opposite it %0aare strengthened. For opposite each letter (spiritually pure forces or properties) %0athere is an opposing impure force (egoistic desire), as it is written: "The Creator %0ahad made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%0aThe strengthening of the impure forces from the properties of the letter Shin %0aoccurred as a result of her properties joining the impure properties of falsehood, %0aforging spiritual purity of the letters Kuf and Reish: falsehood would be unable %0ato exist in the world, for it would be recognized at once, had the letters Kuf and %0aReish not put Shin at the head of the word SheKeR (falsehood). And when truth %0astands at the head of the word that designates the property of falsehood, man %0anaturally tends to err. %0a%0aThere are two sources of impure forces: the first is a small luminescence %0a(Ner Dakik), which the pure force itself (the Creator) sends to the impure forces %0a(desires) so as to sustain them. This is done so they would not disappear until %0athere is a need to "punish" the sinners with them. However, these are small %0aforces— their height is not great, for they receive only a small luminescence, %0asufficient to sustain their life. %0a%0aThis small luminescence descends into the impure forces from the letter %0aKuf, which results in these impure forces becoming similar to man in the %0aworlds BYA, as a monkey in comparison to a human being, as it is said: "The %0aCreator had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%0aThe second source of impure forces arises from the lower ones' spiritual fall: %0aas a result of people's evil, egoistic actions, the Light passes from the system of %0athe pure forces into the impure. And the first transgression is Adam's sin, by %0awhich the system of the impure forces assumed an identical formation to that of %0athe pure system, stationing itself opposite, parallel to it. As a result, the impure %0aworlds ABYA emerged opposite the pure ones. %0a%0aThe second source of impure forces is the letter Reish, which indicates that %0athe impure forces rise and attach themselves to the pure forces, right up to the %0alevel of Bina of Malchut, designated by the letter Dalet. %0a%0aAs was previously stated, the twenty-two letters of Partzuf Malchut of the %0aworld of Atzilut are divided in three groups of letters: units in Bina, tens in ZA, %0aand hundreds in Malchut. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a151 %0a%0a%0a%0aPARTZUF %0a%0a%0aSEFIROT %0a%0a%0aLETTERS %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aAleph-Tet %0a%0a%0aBIN A (IMA) %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aYod-Tzadik %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aKuf-Tav %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aAleph-Tet %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aYod-Tzadik %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aKuf-Tav %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0aAleph-Tet %0a%0a%0aMALCHUT %0a%0a%0aZA %0a%0a%0aYod-Tzadik %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aMalchut %0a%0a%0aKuf-Tav %0a%0a%0a%0aThe letters Alepk-Bet-Gimel correspond to Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina, called %0a"the head" of a spiritual object (Partzuf). The letters from Dalet to Tet refer to the %0abody of the Partzuf. %0a%0a%0a%0aAleph %0a%0a%0a■ Keter %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aBet %0a%0a%0a■ Hochma %0a%0a%0aHEAD %0a%0a%0aGimel %0a%0a%0aBina %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aDalet %0a%0a%0a■ Hesed %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aHey %0a%0a%0a■ Gevura %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aVav %0a%0a%0a■ Tifferet %0a%0a%0aBODY %0a%0a%0aZayin %0a%0a%0aNetzah %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aChet %0a%0a%0a■ Hod %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aTet %0a%0a%0a■ Yesod %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a%0aThe body only receives what descends to it from the head. Therefore, Dalet, %0athe first letter of the body, through which the body receives Light from the head, %0ais called Dalah ve Aniyah (poor and destitute). Dalet only receives what Gimel gives %0ait. Since Gimel contains the Light of Hassadim, that is, what descends into Dalet. %0a%0aAnd this is why the letter Gimel is called Gomel Hassadim (merciful One) %0a(Talmud, Shabbat, 104), according to its action with regard to Dalet, which would %0aotherwise be completely without Light. The protruding sharp angle on the right %0aside of Dalet is the sign of Dalet's abundance of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0a%0a%0a152 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, opposite the pure (altruistic) Malchut, stands the impure Malchut, %0awho is pride and does not wish to receive the Light from Gimel and rely on it. %0aInstead, she rises up in the desire to be the head, and in so creates the sharp %0aangle of the Dalet. That indicates that the presence of Ohr Hassadim disappears, %0atransforming it into the letter Reish, which is written as it is pronounced— with %0atwo letters: Reish and Shin. %0a%0aThe true merging of the pure ZA and Malchut is called ECHaD (one), %0aconsists of the letters Aleph, Chet and Dalet, for the letters from Aleph to Chet %0aare the nine Sefirot of ZA. He passes the Light from Gimel of Bina to Gimel of %0aMalchut, resulting in Malchut being filled with the Light of Hassadim, thereby %0abecoming Dalet with a protruding right angle. As a result of this, ZA and %0aMalchut become one. %0a%0aWhen the lower ones (people) sin in their actions (intentions), they give %0athe impure Malchut the strength to cling to the pure one— Dalet, to erase the %0asharp angle of the Light of Hassadim and turn it into the letter Reish. Thus, %0athe word Echad (one) becomes Acher (other, alien, foreign): Ale£>h-Chet-Dalet of %0athe word Echad are transformed into Aleph-Chet-Reish of the word Acher, for %0ainstead of the connection with the Creator emerges a connection with other, %0aimpure forces, called "Elokim Acherim" (other gods), which cling to ZA and %0aMalchut of the pure world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThis leads to the letters Kuf and Reish distorting the Creator's seal (Shin), %0athe letter of truth. As a result, Yesod of Malchut, which receives from Yesod de ZA, %0abecomes linked to the impure source instead of the pure, for a new Yesod of the %0aimpure Malchut was formed with the help of the letter Shin. %0a%0aFrom here the impure forces develop up to ten Sefirot with a head and a %0abody, whereas Shin becomes the source of all that desolates, for destruction of %0apurity begets impurity. And from this emerged the system of the impure worlds %0aABYA of the impure man. %0a%0aThus, we have learned how the letters Kuf and Reish became the two %0asources of emergence and development of impure forces. And since the impure %0aforces pose as pure, they are called false, counterfeit letters whose purpose is to %0aannihilate the system of the pure forces and their unity with the Creator, so as %0ato forge themselves out of the devastation of the pure forces. %0a%0aThe birth of the impure forces from the destruction of the pure ones %0ais possible on account of the letter Shin, Yesod of Malchut, joining with the %0aimpure forces as a result of the forging of the letter Reish out of Dalet. Thereby, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a153 %0a%0a%0a%0aEchad turns into Acher, and the system of the impure forces (Elokim Acherim, %0aother gods) is created. %0a%0aAnd had the letters Kuf and Reish not captured the letter Shin, such an %0aenormous system of impure forces, so capable of lying and falsifying everything %0ain the eyes of man, would not have come into being. %0a%0aTherefore, the Creator answered the letter Shin: "Though you are good, you %0awill stand at the head of the word Sheker (falsehood) together with the letters %0aKuf and Reish. Indeed, upon capturing you, with your power they will be able %0ato create an entire system of impure forces of falsehood and forgery. Hence, I %0acannot create the world with your properties, for since there is an impure system %0aopposite from you, it is impossible to achieve the goal of creation with you." %0a%0aTHE LETTERS KUF AND REISH %0a%0a25. From the aforesaid, it follows that whoever wishes to tell a lie will succeed %0aif he first tells the truth as a base on which the lie will then grow and start %0ato act. And this is because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, in which the %0aPatriarchs had been united, for the three lines in the writing of the letter %0aShin (w) signify the three Patriarchs, who designate the Sefirot-properties %0aHesed-Qevura-Tifferet. %0a%0aThe letters Kuf and Reish indicate the evil side, as they form the impure %0aside, called KaR (cold), which lacks warmth and life, for it draws its sustenance %0afrom Malchut when she turns from living water into ice. However, to create an %0aopportunity to exist, these letters attach the Shin to themselves, thus creating the %0acombination KeSHeR (tie, knot), which embodies strength and survival. %0a%0aFor the Light of Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet of Bina, which she receives from Yesod %0ade ZA, creates a new ending in Malchut, a new Kli-desire to receive the Light %0acalled "100 blessings" from ZA. And since Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet are called the %0aPatriarchs, and the Light that passes to Malchut descends from them, the letter %0aShin that designates them is called "truth." %0a%0aBy eliminating the sharp angle of the letter Dalet, the impure forces turn it %0ainto the letter Reish. By this, they convert the word ECHaD into ACHeR, thereby %0astealing Yesod of the pure Malchut, designated by Shin. Also, with the letter Shin %0athey build the Yesod of the impure Malchut, which leads to a very strong clinging %0aof impure forces to pure ones. This clinging is called KeSHeR, the reciprocal tie %0ajoining pure and impure forces, a knot that is not easily severed. %0a%0a%0a%0a154 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aFrom the aforesaid, we see that the reason for the letters wishing for the world %0ato be created with them is that each of them believes that only its properties can %0acorrect the world. The letter Shin thinks that the Light of Hassadim will bring the %0asouls to the goal of creation. However, the letters Kuf and Reish—KaR (cold)— do %0anot desire this Light, for receiving the Light of Mercy for the sake of bestowal is %0apure, but receiving it for the sake of pleasure is impure. %0a%0aTHE LETTER TZADIK %0a%0a26. Subsequently, the letter Tzadik appeared before the Creator and said: %0a"Master of the world, You should create the world with me, for Tzadikim (the %0arighteous) are marked by me. You, who is called a Tzadik (righteous one), are %0aalso recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. %0aTherefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by." %0a%0aThe Creator answered: "Tzadik, you are truly righteous, but you must %0aremain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world %0ato be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse." The concealment %0aof the letter Tzadik is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was %0athen joined by the letter Yod from the Creator's Holy Name Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey %0a(HaVaYaH), who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator %0aand His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, %0athereby creating the letter Tzadik. %0a%0aThe reason for the necessity of concealing the letter Tzadik, which makes it %0aunsuitable for the creation of the world with it, is that when the Creator created %0aAdam, i.e., ZA, He created him as two Part?u/im-objects— male and female, %0aconnected to each other back to back. This is why the letter Yod stands with its %0aback to the back of the letter Nun, both facing opposite directions, just as the %0aletter Tzadik is depicted: the face of Yod turned upwards, while the face of Nun %0ais turned downwards. %0a%0aAnd the Creator also said to Tzadik: "In the future I will revoke the %0arelationship of back-to back, and will join them face-to-face. In another place shall %0ayou so rise as such, but not at the beginning of creation. For in the beginning of %0acreation, you must be connected back-to-back by the letters Nun and Yod, for this %0aform indicates that the Light in you is concealed. Therefore, the world cannot %0abe created with you." The letter Tzadik then left. %0a%0aTzadik came to suggest that the world should be created with its properties, %0afor when it saw that the Tav's request was turned down by the Creator due to %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a155 %0a%0a%0a%0aits heavy laws, and the letter Shin— due to the impure forces clinging to it— it %0athought that its properties could be suitable for the creation of the world. After %0aall, it, too, contains the Creator's seal, and no impure forces cling to it. %0a%0aThat is why Tzadik said to the Creator that the righteous are sealed by %0aits name as a mark of their union with Him, by circumcision and turning %0aup of the place of contact (Zivug) with the Creator, which, thanks to these %0acorrections, repels all the impure forces. %0a%0aThe Creator, called Bina, is also marked by Tzadik, for He is righteous %0alike ZA, since the Upper Part of Bina of the world of Atzilut (Aba ve Ima— AVI) %0acorresponds to the male and female parts, like ZA and Malchut. And AVI are %0aforever joined so as to send down the Light of Mercy and thus sustain the %0aexistence of all that are below them. This is why Tzadik thought itself suitable %0afor creating the world, for the world lives by the Light of Mercy, and can reach %0athe goal with its help. %0a%0aThe letter Tzadik is called the Sefira Yesod of ZA. When Yesod joins with %0aMalchut, it is defined as Tzadik (righteous), for the nine Sefirot of ZA are from Yod %0ato Tzadik, and Kuf is the beginning of Malchut, which consists of four Sefirot— %0aKuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav. %0a%0aWhen Malchut is joined with Yesod of ZA, Kuf is joined with Tzadik, and %0aYesod is called Tzadik (righteous). And to this the Creator replied to Tzadik that %0ait is Tzadik in Yesod of ZA: "And you are Tzadik in Me, for AVI are forever joined %0aso as to pour down the Light of Mercy and sustain the existence of the lower %0aones. And you are righteous, for Malchut is also connected to you, just as in the %0aalphabet, Kuf follows Tzadik. Yet, in spite of all that, you do not merit for your %0aproperties to become the basis of the world." %0a%0aYesod of ZA includes in itself Malchut in the form of the letter Kuf in the %0aword TzadiK. And when Malchut is included in Yesod as Tzadik, it is designated %0aby the letter Nun, for Nun is Gevura of ZA (Yod-Keter, Chaf-Hochma, Lamed-Bina, %0aMem-Hesed, Nun-Gevura). %0a%0aWhen ZA grows and becomes big, his Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet become %0aSefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat. Thus, Gevura becomes Bina. And when ZA becomes %0asmall once again, Bina, too, returns to being Gevura (Nun). This fall is designated %0aby Nun's head looking down. %0a%0aThe letter Tzadik consists of the letters Nun and Yod connected back-to-back. %0aThe letter Nun designates Malchut with the properties of the Sefira Yesod included in %0aher; Yod designates the actual Yesod of ZA. Their connection— back-to-back, facing %0aout in opposite directions— indicates that impure forces cling to their backs. %0a%0a%0a%0a156 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThey conceal their backs from strangers since there is a flaw in their backs— the %0adesire to receive the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma). This flaw must be concealed %0aso as to prevent the impure forces from clinging to their backs. Therefore, the %0aletter Tzadik is unsuitable for the world to be created by its properties. Its very %0ashape reveals an opportunity for the impure forces to cling to it; this is why Adam %0a(created out of ZA and Malchut when they are joined as Tzadik) is also created %0aconsisting of two halves, male and female, joined at their backs. %0a%0aAnd if the letter Tzadik were to argue that in the big state, in the presence %0aof Ohr Hochma, ZA and Malchut unite face-to-face, it would be told that such %0aconnection is impossible at their place, but only during their ascent to AVI. For %0aif such a connection were possible in their own place, the impure forces would %0aimmediately cling to them. For this reason, the letter Tzadik is unworthy of %0abecoming the basis of the universe. %0a%0aTHE LETTER PEH %0a%0a27. The letter Peh entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0ato create the world with me, for the future liberation of the world is inscribed %0ain me, as the word Pedut (liberation, redemption) begins with me. That is, %0aliberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create %0athe world with me." %0a%0aThe Creator answered her: "Though you are fine, the word Peshah %0a(transgression) begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent %0athat strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding %0afrom others' eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the %0aletter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it." And the Creator also said to the %0aletter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, %0afor within it is the property of Avon (crime, sin). And though Ayin tried to %0aobject, saying that its properties are contained in the word Anavah (humility), %0athe Creator refused it nonetheless. %0a%0aPedut (Liberation) begins with the letter Peh, meaning that the property %0aof Peh is contained in future liberation. This is why the letter Peh claims that %0ait is worthy of being the basis of the world. Indeed, both Galut (exile) and %0aGe'ula (redemption) depend on Malchut: when Malchut has no inner Light %0aof Hochma, the people of Israel are exiled from the land of Israel. For in our %0aworld, the land of Israel corresponds to Malchut of the world of Atzilut, the %0aspiritual land of Israel. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a157 %0a%0a%0a%0aJust as in the spiritual world, ZA (Israel) distances from Malchut (the land %0aof Israel), the people of Israel separate and leave their land in our world. And %0awhen the children of Israel correct their actions, they cause ZA (Israel) to fill his %0aMalchut (the land of Israel) with Light, build her with his Light and unite with %0aher face-to-face. As a result, the children of Israel of our world merit redemption %0aand return to their land. %0a%0aThe Light from ZA, which builds and fills Malchut, descends from Sefirot %0aNet^ah and Hod in ZA. Hochma of Malchut clothes in Net^ah and Bina of Malchut %0aclothes in Hod. The letters Ayin and Peh are Netzah and Hod in ZA. This is why %0aPeh, the Sefira Hod in ZA, claimed that it was suitable to be the basis of the world, %0afor the Light of Hochma that brings redemption to the entire world stems from %0aPeh to Malchut. Thus, if the world achieved its property, it would undoubtedly %0areach the end of correction— complete redemption. %0a%0aThe letter Peh thought that it was more suitable to become the basis of %0athe world than Ayin because although Ohr Hochma enters Netzah-Ayin and Hod- %0aPeh, and is mainly present in Netzah-Ayin, redemption depends on Hod-Peh, %0anonetheless. That is because initially, Bina liberates Malchut from her restrictions %0aand thereby redeems her. %0a%0aBy receiving from Bina her properties of mercy, Malchut merits redemption. %0aThis is fulfilled in the following way: Bina transcends her own properties and %0ajoins with Malchut, as a result of which, upon receiving the Light of Hassadim, %0aMalchut can now receive the Light of Hochma. The restrictions imposed on the %0areception of Light mostly affect the left side, i.e., Hod-Peh in ZA. And that is why %0athe letter Peh thought that since the Light of Bina enters it, and not Netzah-Ayin, %0ait is better suited to become the basis of the world. %0a%0aHowever, all the individual corrections made during the 6,000 years of the %0aworld's existence until the end of correction are considered incomplete, for the %0aUpper Light, which allows for the discovery and analysis of all the impure forces %0awithin oneself, is not present in its entirety. Therefore, the Light may not be %0areceived in the worlds of BYA, below Parsa, below the boundary that separates %0athe world of At^ilut from the worlds of BYA. %0a%0aParsa is Malchut that ascended to Bina in order to restrict the diffusion and %0areception of Light into those parts of her that are located below Bina. And as %0aa consequence of Adam's attempt to nevertheless receive the Light under the %0aParsa, impurity slipped into Malchut, of which it is said that the serpent appeared %0abefore Chava (Eve) and brought impurity upon her (Talmud, Shahhat, 146). This %0aimpurity will only be corrected at the end of correction. %0a%0a%0a%0a158 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe thing is that the absence of the Upper Light in the force capable of %0adiscerning good from evil in all of Malchut's thickness gives rise to a flaw called %0a"tears"— two tears that fall into a vast sea from the two eyes of Hochma and Bina %0athat are concealed from all. %0a%0aThe two eyes are Hochma and Bina, and the tears signify the flaw in them %0afrom the presence of the impure force that appeared in them as a result of %0aAdam's sin. This led to the ruin of the two Temples. These tears in Malchut's %0aeyes will only dry at the end of correction, when death disappears from the %0aworld and all the Light shines in Hochma and Bina (item 56). %0a%0aSo the letter Peh was told that although it brings the world Pedut (redemption) %0awith its Light, and although all redemptions pass only through it, this Light is %0aincomplete. All the individual corrections are imperfect, for they come and go, %0ajust as the two Temples. %0a%0aFor the properties of Peshah (transgression) and Pedut (redemption) in the %0aletter Peh are not sufficiently perfect and complete so as to withstand the sin of %0aAdam, for in the absence of the full Light of Hochma, there is clinging of impure %0aforces. Hence, the letter Peh is unworthy of being the basis of the world. %0a%0aAnd since the property of Peshah (transgression) is concealed, the force of %0athe serpent is present therein, deceiving people and leading them to their death. %0aAnd it is impossible to kill it, just as a snake bites and immediately hides its head %0ain itself (similar to the head of the letter Peh), which makes it impossible to kill %0ait, for one may only kill the serpent within oneself by striking the "head." This %0ais why the letter Peh is unsuitable for the creation of the world. %0a%0aTHE LETTER AYIN %0a%0aBina of the world of Atzilut is called Ima Ilaa (Supernal Mother) and also Anavah %0a(modesty, humility). (Here, the capital "A" designates the letter Ayin, not to be %0aconfused with Aleph). The Sefira Netzah of Zeir Anpin (designated by the letter %0aAyin) clothes into Malchut with all of its Light, and ascends to Bina, who adorns %0aher with her own adornments: Bina clothes into Netzah of ZA. But since the %0aletter Peh, signifying Peshah (transgression) is concealed in ~Netzah, the Creator %0arefused to create the world with its properties, as it is written in item 27. %0a%0aTwo words render the meaning of the word "transgression" in Hebrew: %0aPeshah and Avon. However, "transgression" is mainly concentrated in the letter %0aPeh, for Malchut of ZA connects into the Sefira Hod of ZA. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a159 %0a%0a%0a%0aAs a result of Adam's sin, Klipot (shells, impure forces) cling to Malchut of %0aZA. But Netrah of ZA is a property of ZA himself, and impure forces cannot %0acling to it. Yet, as it is written in the Talmud (Baba Kama), even Netrah is subject %0ato Klipot clinging to it. %0a%0aThis flaw— the ability of the impure forces to cling to Netrah of ZA— is called %0a"transgression." However, the word Avon (not Peshah) indicates that Netrah is %0apure and direct, and that the transgression is caused by its connection with %0athe Se/ira Hod. %0a%0aThe reason the Creator turns to the letters Peh and Ayin at the same time %0ais that Netrah and Hod are like two body parts— two legs. This is why they both %0aappeared before Him with their requests. However, The Zohar clarifies each of %0athem (their properties) one at a time. %0a%0aTHE LETTER SAMECH %0a%0a28. The letter Samech appeared before the Creator and said: "Creator of the %0aworld, it would be good to create the world with my properties, for within %0ame is Smicha (support) for the fallen, as it is written: 'The Creator supports %0a(Somech) all who fall.'" The Creator replied: "That is why you are needed in %0ayour place; do not move from it. If you move from your place, contained in %0athe word Somech, those who fall will lose your support, for they rely on you %0a(your properties)." Having heard this, the letter Samech departed. %0a%0aThe letter Samech stands for Se/ira Tifferet in ZA, i.e., Bina in the body of %0aZA. Since Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina (KHB) were transformed into Hesed-Gevura- %0aTifferet (HGT) in ZA, they were emptied of the Light of Hochma, and were left %0awith only the Light of Hassadim, thus changing their name from KHB to HGT. %0a%0aAs we know, Bina consists of two parts: the Upper Part, called GAR: Gimel %0a(three) Rishonot (first ones)— the first three Sefirot KHB, and the lower part, called %0aZAT: Zayin (seven) Tachtonot (lower ones)— the seven lower Sefirot from Hesed to %0aMalchut. The Upper Part of Bina is called Aba ve Ima (AVI). Being filled with the %0aLight of Mercy, Aba ve Ima exist in a state of perfection— without any desire to %0areceive, but only to bestow. %0a%0aAVI are designated by Samech (numerical value - 60), for they include the %0afirst three Sefirot KHB and three Sefirot of ZA, which, in view of the absence of %0aOhr Hochma in ZA, are not called KHB, but rather HGT. Therefore AVI consist %0aof six Sefirot, each consisting of ten, totaling 60 = Samech. %0a%0a%0a%0a160 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aZAT of Bina receive the Light from Above and pass it on to ZA. This part %0aof Bina has the property of ZA, rather than of Bina, as it needs to receive exactly %0awhat ZA needs, and then pass it to him. Since, unlike Bina, who does not wish %0ato receive anything, ZAT of Bina need to receive Ohr Hochma for ZA, they feels %0aa lack for it, and thus separate from Bina and an independently existing object- %0aPartzuf forms out of her lower part. %0a%0aThis Partzuf is called YESHSUT, and it is designated by the letter Mem %0a(numerical value - 40), for it consists of four Sefirot—Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod %0aof Partzuf AVI. Owing to its shape (properties), the block-letter Mem is called %0aMem Stumah (closed). %0a%0aHowever, this separation of AVI into two parts occurs only when they have %0ano Light of Hochma, but only the Light of Hassadim. Consequently, the Upper %0aPart of Bina remains in its perfection, whereas the lower part feels a flaw in its %0astate by not receiving Ohr Hochma. And since spiritual objects are separated by %0athe differences in their properties, the sensation of imperfection separates the %0alower part of Bina from the Upper. %0a%0aHowever, if those below improve their "intentions" (called "actions" in %0athe spiritual), and ask ZA for help in correcting their actions, overcoming the %0aegoism of impure desires, and acquiring spiritually pure, altruistic desires, ZA %0athen turns to the superior YESHSUT, which turns to AVI. AVI then send their %0arequest even higher, receive the Light of Hochma and pass it to YESHSUT. %0a%0aFinally, YESHSUT and AVI unite into one Partzuf, for having received Ohr %0aHochma, YESHSUT becomes as perfect as AVI are perfect being filled with Ohr %0aHassadim. YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma down to ZA, who then passes %0ait to Malchut. The Light that Malchut receives from ZA is referred to as 100 %0ablessings, for Samech = 60 joins with Mem = 40. %0a%0aHowever, when man sins in his intentions (desires, actions), he does not %0aturn to Malchut with a request for help, causing the Light of Hochma to disappear %0afrom ZA, and ZA returns from Gadlut (big state) back to Katnut (small state). %0a(When ZA contains the Light of Hochma, he is called "big"; and when he is filled %0awith only the Light of Hassadim, he is called "small"). And the united Partzuf %0aBina is once more divided into AVI and YESHSUT. %0a%0aIn this small state (Katnut), ZA and Malchut are in danger of impure forces %0a(Klipot) clinging to them. To make certain this does not happen, for then they %0amay fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa into the worlds BYA, AVI send %0athem the property of Samech (the Light of Mercy). And although it is only the %0aLight of Hassadim without the Light of Wisdom (Light of Hochma), it provides %0aZA and Malchut with the sensation of perfection in acts of bestowal, and thus %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a161 %0a%0a%0a%0aimpure forces can no longer cling to them, for the sole intention of the impure %0aforces is to receive the Light of Wisdom from a pure Partzuf. %0a%0aAnd this is why the Light that fills ZA in Katnut is called Samech, which %0atestifies to its action: Samech "supports" ZA and Malchut so that they wouldn't %0afall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa. %0a%0aThat is why the letter Samech thought that if the world were created with %0aits properties, it would be able to reach the goal of creation and merge with %0athe Creator. Its Light could shine in ZA and Malchut even in their small state, %0aand the Klipa (impure force) would not attempt to snatch the Light from them. %0aOn the contrary, the impure, egoistic forces would flee from its Light. Samech %0abelieved that if the world were to be created with its properties, it would be able %0ato protect all creatures, even when their actions were corrupted, for even in such %0aa state, the impure force would not be able to harm them. %0a%0aBut the Creator said to Samech that precisely because its role is to support %0athose who fall and to protect the lower ones in times of their spiritual descent, %0ait must stay in its place and not move from it. For if the world were created by %0ait, its power would always prevail over all, ridding ZA and Malchut of the chance %0ato grow out of their small state. %0a%0aAnd if ZA and Malchut don't stimulate the lower ones (people) to raise %0aMAN— request for help in achieving Gadlut, the Upper Light will not be able %0ato descend to bring the creatures to the end of correction and redemption. %0aTherefore, the letter Samech must support the lower ones until they merit more. %0aBut when they do merit, they will be able to receive the great Light called " 100 %0ablessings" into their entire Partzuf. So the Creator refused to create the world %0awith the letter Samech. %0a%0a"Because the lower ones need Samech only in their Katnut, in the absence %0aof the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), ZON need you and you can help them. %0aHowever, they need you only in their Katnut. But you do not help to bring them %0ato perfection, and so you cannot be the basis of the world." %0a%0aTHE LETTER NUN %0a%0a29. The letter Nun entered and said to the Creator: "It would be good for You %0ato create the world with me, for Norah Tehilot (great praises) is written with %0ame, as well as 'Praising of the righteous.'" %0a%0aThe Creator replied: "Return to your place, for you are the reason that %0athe letter Samech returned to its place. And rely on it for support. For the %0a%0a%0a%0a162 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aletter Nun exists in the word Nefilah (fall), which must be corrected by the %0aletter Samech. This is the reason why it needed to return to its place— so as to %0astrengthen the lower ones." The letter Nun left Him at once. %0a%0aWhen Nun saw that the Creator sent the letter Samech away (as its properties %0aare only used in the state of Katnut, that is, only to support those who had fallen %0afrom the Gadlut), it thought that it was worthy of being the basis of the world. %0aThis is because not only does Nun have all the advantages of Samech, but it can %0aalso use Ohr Hochma, the Light of Gadlut. Thus, the reason for the Creator's %0arefusal to Samech does not apply to Nun. %0a%0aThe Sefira Gevura in ZA is called Nun, for it is entirely mitigated by Bina's %0aproperty of mercy, called Nun = 50 gates of Bina. It is this property of Gevura that %0agives ZA the name Norah Tehilot (great praises). lma-Bina is called Tehilah (praise), %0aand since Gevura descends from Bina, it is referred to as Norah Tehilot, while Nun %0ais used in the Sefira Yesod, in the Gadlut of ZA during his Zivug with Nukva. Like %0aIma, this is whence Nukva receives the name Tehilah, while ZA becomes one in %0aboth Tehilot— Ima and Nulcva. %0a%0aTherefore, the letter Nun said that, being in Gevura, the left line of ZA, it %0aattracts the Light of Mercy emanated by Samech (Bina, Ima), which is also called %0athe "Upper Tehilah," as a result of which ZA acquires its properties and the name %0aNorah Tehilot to match them. This is why Nun has all the properties of Samech: the %0aLight of Mercy that bestows perfection and repels the impure forces-desires. %0a%0aThe letter Nun added: "However, I have an additional advantage in that I am %0aused during the big state of ZA in his Yesod, in the letter Tzadik, of which I am %0athe left element." This Nun in the letter Tzadik is that same Nun that is defined as %0aNorah Tehilot (praises of the righteous), for even when ZA achieves Gadlut during %0athe ascent of ZON to AVI, Nun also acts in Yesod of ZA, connecting Nukva back- %0ato-back with ZA, so that ZA receives the Light of Mercy from AVI (Samech). %0a%0aAnd so Nun is called "praises of the righteous," for Yod (righteous one, the %0abasis of the world) mounts it. Nun is called "great praises," for it attracts the %0aLight of Wisdom to Malchut in the state of Gadlut. %0a%0aTherefore, we find that Malchut receives all her beauty from Nun, which is %0alocated in Yesod of ZA. This is why the letter Nun claimed that it merits for the %0aworld to be created with its properties, for its luminescence adds to the Light of %0aWisdom that unites and revives ZON, and does not merely support them, like %0athe letter Samech. %0a%0aSo the Creator answered it: "You are wrong in thinking that you merit %0aleading the world to complete correction by your properties, without the clinging %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a163 %0a%0a%0a%0aof impure forces, for even your properties need to be supported by the letter %0aSamech. Indeed, this is precisely why you are connected back-to-back with the %0aletter Yod, and the Light of Samech guards you against the clinging of the impure %0aforces onto you. And that is why your properties, which rely upon the strength %0aof Samech, are merely ones of support. Hence, you are unworthy of becoming %0athe basis of the world." %0a%0aTHE LETTERS MEM AND LAMED %0a%0a30. The letter Mem entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0afor You to create the world by me, for MelecH (King) is called by me." The %0aCreator replied: "That is so, but I shall not create the world by you, for the %0aworld needs a King. Return to your place. Also, I shall not create the world %0awith the letters Lamed and Chaf that form the word MeLeCH (King), as the %0aworld cannot exist without a King." %0a%0aThe letter Mem is the Se/ira Hesed in ZA, which receives the Light from its %0acorresponding Se/ira Hesed in Bina. When, in addition to the Light of Mercy %0ain his small state, ZA receives the Light of Wisdom and becomes big, his Sefirot %0aHGT turn into Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat (HBD). In other words, Hesed in ZA %0aascends and becomes Hochma, thereby revealing a new Light, the Light of %0aHochma, the Light of the Creator's face. %0a%0aThis is why the letter Mem claimed that it was suitable for the world to be %0acreated by it, for it reveals the Creator's Light to the world, thereby eliminat- %0aing any risk of impure forces clinging to it, and so the world is guaranteed %0acomplete correction. %0a%0aBut the Creator answered that it is forbidden to reveal this Light to the %0aworld, for the world needs for this great Light to first clothe itself in the three %0aletters of the word MeLeCH. In other words, the great Light may be revealed in %0athe world only if Mem joins with the letters Lamed and Chaf. So the Creator said, %0a"Go and join with them." %0a%0aMem in the word Meleck is Hesed. Lamed is Bina, which passes the Light %0ato ZA. The letter Chaf is Malchut, Nukva of ZA, for there cannot be a Meleck %0a(King) without Malchut (Kingdom). Also, all of the Light becomes revealed only %0athanks to Malchut. %0a%0aIn this case, Malchut shines from ZA in three places: %0a%0a1) Malckut becomes a Kisseh (throne) for a King (ZA). A Kisseh derives from %0aKissui (cover, concealment), so it is designated by the bent letter Chaf. %0a%0a%0a%0a164 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a2) Malchut clothes ZA. Because the great Light is revealed only to Israel, %0aMalchut clothes ZA, and when her kingdom is revealed, ZA frees %0ahimself from her garment and throws it over all the nations of the %0aworld, idolaters, and the Light of his face pours upon Israel. And all %0athe righteous then point their finger at the Creator and say: "This is %0athe Creator, to whom I aspired!" This diffusion of Light is designated %0aby the letter Chaf. %0a%0a3) Malchut becomes a crown on the head of ZA. And this is the property %0aof the letter Chaf, of Keter (crown of ZA). %0a%0aTHE LETTER CHAF %0a%0a31. At this time the letter Chaf descended from the Kisseh - the Creator's %0athrone, and stood before the Creator. It trembled and said to Him: "Creator %0aof the world, with my properties I merit to become the basis of the world, for I %0aam Kavod - Your Glory." When the letter Chaf descended from the Creator's %0athrone, all the worlds trembled, and the throne itself, verging on collapse. %0aThe Creator then answered: "Chaf, what are you doing here? I will not create %0athe world by you. Return to your place, for you exist in the word Kelayah %0a(destruction) and in the word Kalah (bride)." %0a%0aThe Creator's throne is the world of Beria. The appearance of the letter %0aMem before the Creator led to the letter Chaf falling from His throne. As a %0aresult, Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria trembled, as well as all the lower %0aworlds with all their inhabitants. %0a%0aAll the arguments that the letters raised in their wish for the world to be %0acreated with each of them is like raising MAN— a request for precise measure of %0ahelp from Above in the form of Upper Light (called MAD), corresponding to %0athat particular letter. %0a%0aIf so, ZON will rule the world, and this ruling is effected by the very Light %0adescending from ZON in the exact quantity of MAD that each letter evoked %0aand caused, for the MAD precisely corresponds to the MAN in both quantity %0aand quality, whereas MAN is the actual property of the letter. Hence, each letter %0aargues that it can draw the kind of Light from Above that will surely bring all %0acreatures to the goal. %0a%0aSimilarly, the Creator's answers to each of the twenty-two letters of ZON de %0aAtzilut constitute the descending MAD (the Upper Light, strength, help) that %0aprecisely corresponds to the MAN raised by that particular letter. And when the %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a165 %0a%0a%0a%0aUpper Light that descends from a particular letter begins to rule the world, this %0asignifies the Creator's reply to that letter. Since the impure forces cling to one of %0athe letter's properties, as the Creator created two precisely balanced, opposing %0asystems of pure and impure forces, this reveals the letter's inability to rule the %0aworld. And thus, the Creator dismissed each letter's individual claim to build %0athe world by its property in order to bring it to the goal of creation. %0a%0aHerein lies the Creator's "game" with each of the twenty-two letters, giving %0aeach the opportunity to reveal its properties, power and forces, until it becomes %0aclear from their aspirations and analysis, which of them truly merits the world %0abeing governed by it. %0a%0aFrom this we see that when the letter Mem began to reveal its great Light in %0athe world, in doing so, it caused the fall of the Kisse (throne). This is so because %0athe Kisse has two properties: (i) it covers and conceals the Creator, where the %0aword Kisse derives from the word Kissui; (ii) it reveals the Creator's greatness in %0athe worlds with the help of the three letters MeLeCH. Then, Malchut that became %0aa Kissui, the Creator's cover, ascends and turns to Chaf— the Creator's own gar- %0aments—thus revealing the King (Creator), and it becomes a crown on His head. %0a%0aBut as soon as the letter Mem, which was not clothed in Chaf, began to reveal %0athe Light of the Creator's face, the letter Chaf fell from the Kisse (the throne of %0aHis Glory), stopped concealing Him, and stated that from now on only the %0aCreator's revealed glory would rule over it, without any kind of concealment, as %0adesired by Mem. %0a%0aOwing to Chaf s fall from the throne, two hundred thousand worlds that origi- %0anate from Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria, as well as the worlds below them, %0ashook and trembled on the verge of collapse. For the entire connection between %0athe lower degree or Partzuf and the one above it lies in the fact that Malchut of the %0aUpper Degree becomes Keter of the lower. And the property of the letter Chaf con- %0asists in clothing Malchut of an Upper spiritual object in Keter of a lower one. %0a%0aThere are three distinctive features to the throne: (i) six steps leading to the %0athrone, six Sefirot-Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod of the lower one; (ii) four %0alegs of the throne, the Light in Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina-Daat of the lower one; %0a(iii) Malchut of the Upper One that descends to the lower one, clothes into it, %0aand all the Light from the Upper One is passed through her to the lower one. %0a%0aThus, when Chaf fell from the throne of the Creator's glory, the connection %0abetween the world of Atzilut and the throne (world of Beria) was severed. This %0ais so because Chaf (Malchut of the world of Atzilut) that clothes in Sefirot Keter- %0aHochma-Bina-Daat of the world of Beria pours all the Light onto the world of %0a%0a%0a%0a166 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aBeria, called the throne of His glory. But when Chaf fell from the throne, the %0aconnection between the world of Atzilut and the world of Beria was severed, %0aChaf trembled, for it lost the power to bestow upon the world of Beria, and two %0ahundred thousand worlds (Hochma and Bina out of Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina- %0aDaat of the world of Beria) trembled in fear of collapsing, for they lost all of their %0alife-force, which they receive from the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aSimilarly, in the world of Atzilut, Bina of the world of Atzilut, the Creator, is %0aconnected with ZON. This is because Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut consists %0aof ten Sefirot, and her last Sefira, Malchut, clothes in ZA of the world of Atzilut %0awith the property of the letter Chaf. Malchut of the Sefira Bina, which clothes in %0aZA, is the letter Chaf. And this letter Chaf is the Creator's throne in ZA. For the %0aCreator is Bina, Sefira above ZA. And ZA becomes a throne for Bina. And during %0athe fall, the connection between Bina and ZA is severed, since Chaf is Malchut of %0aBina; it clothes into ZA and passes all the Light to him. %0a%0aAnd it therefore trembled (lost its ability to bestow upon ZA), and so did %0atwo hundred thousand worlds, which are the Light for ZA, called Hochma and %0aBina or KHBD— the four legs of the throne— for all the Light departed from %0athem. And the worlds trembled in fear of collapsing, that is, Sefirot Hesed-Gevura- %0aTifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod in ZA that include all the worlds below them, for all the %0aLight of Bina departed thence. %0a%0aThe Creator told the letter Chaf that because it fell from the throne of His %0aglory, the first three Sefirot of ZA trembled, and all the other worlds are on the %0averge of total collapse and destruction without any hope of restoration; hence, %0aChaf must return to its place in the throne of glory. %0a%0aChaf's return to its place in the Creator's throne takes place just as He %0arefuses to create the world with the letter Mem, for the world needs a King. That %0ais, the trembling of the letter Chaf as it fell from the Creator's throne, which %0ain turn, made the worlds tremble in fear of possible collapse, and the Creator's %0aanswer to the letter Mem transpire simultaneously. %0a%0aTHE LETTER YOD %0a%0a32. The letter Yod entered and said: "Maker of the world! It would be good %0ato create the world by me, for Your Holy name begins with me." The Creator %0areplied: "It is sufficient that you are inscribed in My Name, in Me, and all of %0ayour aspirations are to Me, and you should not be uprooted from it all." %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a167 %0a%0a%0a%0aSince Yod is the first letter of the Creator's name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav- %0aHey), the beginning of the Creator's revelation to creatures, the first degree %0aof the Upper Light, the letter Yod argued for the world to be created with %0aits properties, for the world would then be absolutely guaranteed complete %0acorrection. However, the Creator objects to it. As was already stated, the letters' %0aquestions and the Creator's answers signify the Creator playing with each letter, %0awhere the letters' questions are their MAN, and the Creator's answers are MAD %0ain the form of the Upper Light. %0a%0aSo, by telling Yod, "It is sufficient," the Creator thus explained the creation of %0arestriction— that the Light is only allowed to descend to its level, but no further. %0aAnd this restriction is fixed in the Creator's name Shadday (Shin-Dalet-Yod). After %0aYod began to spread with the great Light, the Creator stopped it, forbidding it %0ato spread to the letter Tav, but only to Shin (as was said above, in item 25). He %0asaid to it: "Enough, and do not spread further. Otherwise you will not be able %0ato remain forever in My Name HaVaYaH." %0a%0aAs the sages said: "My Name is not pronounced as it is written. For it is %0awritten HaVaYaH, but pronounced Adonay" (Talmud, Pesahim, 50). Indeed, %0athe name HaVaYaH is not subject to change, as it is written: "For I, the Lord %0a(HaVaYaH), do not change" (Malachi, 3:6). For corruption and its correction %0aemerge in the days of the world's existence, meaning that constant changes are %0acoming. Therefore, until the end of correction, the Creator is called Adonay, for %0athis name is subject to change, and not HaVaYaH, which can never be altered. %0a%0aYet, in the future, after the end of correction, HaVaYaH will be pronounced %0aas it is written. Therefore, the Creator said, "If I see some fault or evil in you, %0aby this you will be removed from My Name, for My Name, HaVaYaH, may not %0acontain anything flawed or corrected— neither corruption nor correction. And %0athis is why the world cannot be created by your properties." There are three %0adegrees in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH: in the Sefira Hochma of ZA, in %0aHochma of AVI, and in Hochma of Arich Anpin, called "concealed wisdom." %0a%0aHaVaYaH begins with a dot, which then turns into Yod. Subsequently, Yod %0a(Ohr Hochma) spreads to the sides and downward and turns into the letter Dalet, %0awhich consists of a horizontal roof-like line that indicates the property of Bina- %0aIma (mercy, Hassadim, width). When Ohr Hassadim stops spreading in width, %0aOhr Hochma begins to spread downward in the form of a vertical line. This is the %0aleg of the letter Dalet, the property of Hochma-Aba. %0a%0aThe common property of AVI is designated by the letter Dalet. AVI beget %0aZA, designated by the letter Vav inside the Dalet, and eventually forms the shape %0a%0a%0a%0a168 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aof the letter Hey. Thus, the request of ZA (Vav) to receive from AVI compels %0athem to unite their properties of Hochma (vertical line) and Hassadim (horizontal %0aline), with the help of the letter Yod. Consequently, AVI receive the Light from %0aYod and pass it on to ZA. %0a%0aThe screen with the desires of Malchut is called "a point," since the collision %0abetween the screen and the coming Light yields Returning Light. And since the %0areceived Light always consists of ten Lights, the screen is called "ten points." %0a%0aYod designates the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf Keter, from the Light %0aof Hochma downwards, while Vav signifies the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf %0aHochma. However, there is no sign in HaVaYaH that indicates the diffusion of %0aLight in Keter. %0a%0aEntrance or exit of the letter Yod in a word signifies either presence or %0aabsence of the Light of Hochma. There are four kinds of correction: %0a%0a1. The First Ibur— conception of the small state of ZON. This is an %0aabsolutely passive spiritual state, where the letter Yod enters the %0aword Ohr (Light) and transforms it into Avir (air), becoming the %0aVAK of the Partzuf. %0a%0a2. The letter Yod exits the word Avir, which converts it back to Ohr: the %0aLight of Hochma enters VAK of Partzuf; %0a%0a3. The Second Ibur— conception of the Gadlut state of ZON: AHP of %0aBina ascend from ZON to Bina, and GE de ZON ascend with them, %0afor they were together in the Katnut state, defined as conception of %0aGE de ZON; %0a%0a4. The diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a%0aTHE LETTER TET %0a%0a33. The letter Tet entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0ato create the world with me, for it is by me that You are called Tov (Good)." %0aThe Creator replied: "I will not create the world by you, for your goodness is %0aconcealed within you and is invisible. Therefore, it cannot take any part in %0athe world that I wish to create, and will only be revealed in the world to come. %0aAnd since your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the palace will %0asink into the ground, for the letter Chet is opposite from you, and when you %0ajoin together, the word CHeT (sin) will be formed. This is why these two %0aletters are not recorded in the names of the holy tribes." The letter Chet %0aimmediately moved aside. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a169 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe letter Tet, whose numeric value of nine, is the inner property of the %0aSefira Yesod in ZA, while the outer property of Yesod in ZA is the letter Tzadik, %0awhose numeric value of ninety, and it joins with Nukva de ZA, forming the %0anotion of Tzadik (righteous one). Besides being the inner property of Yesod in %0aZA, Tet is also the ninth letter among the letters of Bina in ZA. %0a%0aAlso, Tet is called Tov (good). And since Tov is called Tzadik, for it is the %0ainner Light of Yesod, called Tzadik, to whom no impure forces could cling, Tet %0acalls on the above to justify its claim to become the basis of the world. %0a%0aIn the Talmud (Hagiga, 12), the sages wrote: "In the Light by which the %0aCreator created the world, Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. %0aBut the Creator saw that the deeds of the generations of the Flood and the %0abuilders of the Tower of Babel are detrimental, and concealed that Light for the %0arighteous in the future." Because the Creator saw that their actions will bring %0athe threat of the clinging of the impure forces, He concealed this Light, Thus, %0athe Light descended secretly from the Supernal Righteous (AVI) to the righteous %0aone (Yesod in ZA), the letter Tet. %0a%0aAnd so the Creator told Tet that because He must conceal it from the sinners %0aand only the righteous will be worthy of it in the world to come, it cannot %0apartake in the creation and correction of the world, for the world is ZON, and %0athe letter Tet is constantly in danger of being clung to by impure forces. %0a%0aAnd since this Light shines only secretly inside Yesod of ZA, and not %0aopenly, Nukva will not be able to receive this Light directly, but only through %0aits concealment in her. Therefore, the gates of Nukva sink into her Sefira Yesod, %0awhich safeguards them against the clinging of the impure forces, and they are %0aconfident that the impure forces will not be able to rule over her gates. For even %0aat the time of the ruin of the Temple, the impure forces could not rule over the %0agates of the Temple, and sank into the ground, that is, the ground consumed %0athem. "But because you are in need of such protection, I cannot create the world %0awith you," the Creator answered Tet. %0a%0aThere are two pipes (channels) in Yesod de ZA in the world of Atzilut: the %0aright one serves for the birth of the souls, and the left one for throwing away %0awaste to the impure forces. The letter Chet is Hod, whose property is Malchut %0ain ZA, the left pipe in Yesod of ZA, for the properties of the letter Chet are the %0aproperties of Ku/ included in Yesod, whereas Ku/ emanates Ner Dakik (tiny Light) %0ato the impure forces, from which they receive the strength to be similar to an %0aimage of a pure man, as a monkey compared to a man, for the Creator created %0apurity parallel to impurity. %0a%0a%0a%0a170 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThese two pipes are located very close to each other, separated only by a thin %0apartition, called "a garlic husk." Consequently, the left pipe has the strength to %0arule over the right one, thereby forming CHeT (numerical value 8 + 9 = 17). %0a%0aThe numerical value of CHeT (17) equals that of the word TOV (9 + 6 + %0a2 = 17), which means that the impure force opposes the pure one. And if the %0aright pipe (the letter Tet) prevails, the word CHeT (sin) will turn into TOV %0a(good, goodness). %0a%0aSince the left pipe (CHeT) has the strength to rule over the right one (Tet), %0athe impure forces can suck the Upper Light for themselves. This would give %0apower to the sinners of the world. This is why neither diet nor Tet are present in %0athe names of the twelve tribes of Israel, to show that they (the tribes) are above %0athe letter Chet, the root of all the opposing impure forces. %0a%0aWhen all the letters merited receiving a blessing through the letter Bet, they %0alined up in their alphabetical order, in which the letters Tet and Reish joined. %0aThe letter Tet ascended, but did not take its place until the Creator asked her: %0a"Tet, why did you ascend, but do not take your place?" It replied: "You created %0ame to begin the words Tov (goodness) and Torah, as it is written: 'And the %0aCreator saw that the Light was good.' How then can I join and stand beside the %0aletter Reish, when it begins the word Rah (evil)?" %0a%0aThe Creator answered: "Return to your place, for it is precisely you that %0aneeds the letter Reish. For man, whom I intend to create, combines all those %0aproperties— you as the right property, and Reish as the left." After that, both Tet %0aand Reish returned to their places. %0a%0aThree lines emerge in ZA of the world of Atzilut. However, they emerge from %0atheir source, Bina. (As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascends to Bina, %0awhich leads to Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut falling into a lower Partzuf, into ZA.) Bina %0ais called Eloh-im (Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem), and as a result of second restriction, %0aher part Ale£>h-Lame%3ci-He)i (the ELEH of the word Eloh-im, AHP) fell into a lower %0aPartzuf, to ZA. Only the letters Yod-Mem (the IM of Eloh-im) remained in Bina. %0aThis means that only half, ( VAK, GE) remained in her from the previous level of %0aGAR. Whatever is left is designated by a sign called Holam—Vav with a dot above %0ait, as this is the right line, Ohr Hassadim. %0a%0aThen, in the big state, the letters Ale£>h-Lame%3ciHe;y (ELEH) returned to Bina %0aand joined with Yod-Mem (IM). Subsequently, the level of GAR returned, yet the %0aLight of Hochma in Bina was incomplete, for the Light of Hassadim disappeared %0aand the Light of Hochma cannot shine without the Light of Hassadim. The %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a171 %0a%0a%0a%0areturned letters A-L-H are Shuruk—Vav with a dot inside it, because, due to the %0arestrictions in it, it constitutes the left line. %0a%0aThese restrictions are effective until ZON, upon ascending to Bina, begin to %0areceive the Light, and the middle line emerges and reduces GAR of Hochma in %0athe left line. As a result, the right line joins with the left: Ohr Hochma shines in %0athe Ohr Hassadim. This middle line is called Hirik—Vav with a dot under it, or %0athe screen of Hirik, for the Light enters the Partzuf because of it. %0a%0aAnd since Bina regained GAR with ZA's help, ZA, now that he had acquired %0athe three lines, begins to receive this Light from Bina, too. Yod-Mem (IM), Tet %0aand Holam constitute the right line, Aleph-Lamed-Hey (ELEH), Reish and Shuruk %0aconstitute the left. %0a%0aNow let us translate this into the language of Sefirot. When Bina returned %0aonce more to the state of Gadlut, ELEH returned to IM, the left line merged %0awith the right, and this drove Tet (right line, Hassadim) away from Reish (left %0aline). This is because being opposite to each other, they cannot stand side by %0aside until the Creator (ZA, middle line) reduces the GAR of both the left and %0aright lines by the force of His screen, which is expressed by the words: "And the %0aCreator commanded it to return to its place." %0a%0aGAR de Hochma is called Man 'ula— the lock that prevents the Light from %0aentering a Partzuf, and its diminution is called Miftacha— the key that opens a %0apassage for the Light, VAK of Hochma, to spread in the left line into a Partzuf. %0aThen, Tet, the right line, receives Ohr Hochma from the left, joins with Reish, %0areceiving from it the Light of Hochma. Otherwise it would have remained in %0aVAK. Adam, too, is created from the union of these two lines. %0a%0aBut why was the letter Tet reluctant to join with the letter Reish, and had %0ato be forced to do so by the Creator? In the spiritual world, a root rules over %0aall its branches, and the branches submit to its rule. Therefore, Tet did not %0awish to join with Reish, as it was then bound to become a branch and submit %0ato its root, Reish. %0a%0aHowever, the Creator wanted Tet to receive the Light of Hochma from Reish %0aso that this union would enable man to receive the Light of GAR. Thus, when %0aELEH return to Bina, He made it so Bina's restrictions would be weakened so as %0ato allow the Reish to join with the Tet and receive the Light of Hassadim from it. It %0afollows that Tet becomes the root with regard to Reish, for without its Hassadim, %0aReish would be unable to shine, due to the restrictions placed on its Light. %0a%0a%0a%0a172 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE LETTER ZAYIN %0a%0a34. The letter Zayin entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0ato create the world by me, as Shabbat is preserved with me, for it is written: %0a'Remember (Zachor) the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it.'" The Creator %0areplied: "I will not create the world by you, for within you is a force of war, as %0asabers and swords, called Klei Zayin (weaponry), are made by you. And you %0aare like the letter Nun, with which the world was not created, for within it is %0aNefilah (fall)" (item 29). Having heard that, the letter Zayin left Him. %0a%0aThe letter Zayin is depicted as a combination of Vav and Yod, as a head over %0ait, which signifies the big state and the great Light in Malchut, ZA's wife, for %0aMalchut includes herself into her husband, ZA (designated by Vav), and becomes %0aa crown (Yod) on his head. Together, these two letters, Vav with Yod standing %0aabove it, form the letter Zayin. %0a%0aTherefore, it is written: "Remember the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it holy." %0aAs a result of Shabbat's elevation, that is, Nukva's ascent to the head of ZA, when %0ashe becomes his crown, she includes herself in the word Zachor (remember) and %0areceives the name Nukva Kedoshah (holy Nukva). This is why the letter Zayin %0aclaimed that since this Light is so great and holy that it brings absolute rest on %0athis day, for purity is completely separated from impurity in this state called %0aShabbat, it is worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world. %0a%0aZayin is the Sefira Net^ah in ZA. When Nukva is included in Net^ah and %0amerges with its properties, she gains the strength to ascend along with ZA to %0aAVI. There she becomes a crown on his head, by which he is adorned, which %0asignifies the day of Shabbat. However, since this correction occurs solely as a %0aresult of her inclusion in the male essence and their ascent to AVI, and not in %0aher regular place, where she normally abides with ZA, Nukva cannot be corrected %0acompletely during the 6,000 years. %0a%0aThe reason for this is that when Nukva returns to her place on weekdays, her %0aconnection with the letter Za^in is defined as a Kli Zayin (weapon), and all the wars %0awith the impure forces emerge from her, like the weekdays that prepare Shabbat. %0a%0aFor every man must defeat the impure force within him on the weekdays, %0aand thus merit the King's daughter— Shabbat. However, during the 6,000 years, %0athe Light of Shabbat is insufficient for the neutralization of the impure forces, %0afor weekdays return and surround the Shabbat. This continues until the end %0aof correction, when there will be only Shabbat as the day of absolute perfection %0afor all eternity. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a173 %0a%0a%0a%0aThis is also why the Creator replied to Zayin: "I will not create the world with %0ayou, for when you are in your place, your Light is not yet perfect. Only after you %0adefeat the impure forces in war will man be able to attain you." And the shape of %0athe letter Vav (ZA) resembles a spear, ready to strike and pierce through the impure %0aforces. For Gevurot (courage) signifies the left line of Bina's male part (Nun). %0a%0aTHE LETTERS VAV AND HEY %0a%0a35. The letter Vav entered and said: "It would be good to create the world %0awith me, for I am a letter from Your Name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey)." %0aThe Creator replied: "Vav, both you and the letter Hey should just be glad to %0abe contained within My Name. This is why I will not create the world with %0ayour properties." %0a%0aAlthough the letter Yod expressed a similar request, Vav thought that Yod %0ahad been turned down because of its excessive size (spiritual force). This is why %0aVav claimed that it would be good to create the world with its properties, i.e., %0aaccording to the letters Vav-Hey in the name HaVaYaH, with the Light of the %0aSupernal Bina (Ima) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%0aThe Creator responded with the same answer he had given to the letter %0aYod— that He restricted it by saying to DaY (Dalet-Yod): "Stop at the letter Shin %0aand spread no more, so that the impure forces would not cling to you." Hence, %0athe letters Vav and Hey are not suitable for the world to be created with their %0aproperties, for even they need protection against the impure forces. %0a%0aSefira Tifferet is designated by the big letter Vav (Vav with a head), for it has %0aall six (Vav) Sefirot: Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. Yesod is the Sefira that is %0aresponsible for passing the Light from ZA to Malchut. This is why it has the same %0aLight as in Malchut— NHY without HGT, and this is also why Yesod is called the %0asmall Vav (Vav without a head). %0a%0aTHE LETTERS DALET AND QIMEL %0a%0a36. The letters Dalet and Qimel appeared before the Creator. However, the %0aCreator told them right away: "It is enough that you are both together, so that %0aas long as the poor exist on earth, there is someone to treat them with mercy %0a(LiQmol Hesed)." The letter Dalet derives from Dalut (poverty), while Qimel %0arenders mercy to it (Qomelet Hassadim). "Therefore, you cannot part, and it %0ais enough for you to aid one another in this way." %0a%0a%0a%0a174 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aIt was already stated (item 24) that although Dalet receives the Light from %0aGzme! and its sharp right angle protrudes from the Light of Hassadim, the impure %0aforces are nonetheless strong enough to cling to it, separate it and make the %0asharp angle smooth, thus transforming it into the letter Reish. %0a%0aThis is why the letter Dalet requires special protection so as not to be %0acorrupted and to be able to continue being fulfilled by Gimel so as to keep the %0aneedy ones (Dalut) in the world from disappearing. Thus, it is sufficient for %0athese two forces to sustain and complement one another, to fulfill one another %0ain reciprocal union so as to prevent the impure forces from ruling. And this %0arole is enough from them. This is why the Creator did not want to create the %0aworld with them. %0a%0aTHE LETTER BET %0a%0a37. The letter Bet entered and said to the Creator: "Maker of the world, it %0awould be good to create the world by me, as by me You are blessed Above and %0abelow. For Bet is Berachah (blessing)." The Creator replied to Bet: "Of course, %0aI will create the world by you, and you shall be the basis of the world!" %0a%0aThe letter Bet is the property of Hochma (wisdom), or rather Hesed in Hochma, %0aa point in a palace, for Ohr Hassadim is a palace for Ohr Hochma and is called %0aBerachah (blessing). Passing through all of the worlds from the Creator down to %0athe lowest degree of the lowest world, this Light does not diminish in any way. %0a%0aRather, just as this Light is at the Highest Degree that receives it from the %0aWorld of Infinity, it is just as great, magnificent, and mighty in the world of %0aAtzilut, and likewise all the way down to the world of Assiya. And it does not get %0acoarser or weaker as it passes through all the screens from Above downwards. %0a%0aThat is why the letter Bet vied for the world to be created with its properties, %0aas the Light of blessing is the same both Above and below; no screen can weaken %0ait and no coarse desires can harm it. %0a%0aThis is also why the property of mercy (Hassadim) is most suitable for the %0acreation of the world, for no impure forces can cling to it. This is because the %0aimpure forces can only cling to a place where there is a deficiency. And since %0athere is no deficiency of any kind in the property of mercy, there can never be %0aany contact between Bet and the impure forces. %0a%0aThe Creator agreed with Bet that its property is perfect and suitable for %0athe creation of the universe by Him. As it is said: "Olam (world) Hesed (mercy) %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a175 %0a%0a%0a%0aYiBaneh (will be built)," where YiBaneh means Boneh (building) and HaVana %0a(understanding). (In Hebrew, the letters Vav and Bet are denoted by the letter %0aBet). This is because the Creator determined that this property is entirely %0asufficient for precisely evaluating and separating pure from impure. %0a%0aAnd if man seeks an idol in the Creator's stead, a Berachah (blessing) does %0anot descend upon him, for blessing stems from the Creator alone. Thus, it is %0apossible to determine who is righteous and who is a sinner, who works for the %0aCreator's sake and who works for himself, for the world is built by mercy. %0a%0aYet, the Creator did not order the Light of Mercy to rule the world. He merely %0aintended it for a good beginning, sufficient to bring the world to perfection. This %0ais because the Light of Hassadim is incomplete (VAK, and not GAR), insufficient %0afor begetting new souls, for their union and multiplication, as no Partzuf (spiritual %0aobject) can beget until it attains the full Light of Hochma, termed GAR or head. %0aUntil then, the Partzuf remains in a state of imperfection. %0a%0aOur normal (the lowest possible) state is determined by the property of the %0aletter Bet. Hence, the Creator laid it as the basis for the creation of the world. In %0aother words, the basis of a state is a state of a pure Partzuf (object), when nothing %0aat all can diminish or impede it. %0a%0aIn such a state, an addition of Ohr Hochma to Ohr Hassadim, necessary for %0athe birth of a new Partzuf is no longer considered basic and essential. Rather, it %0ais defined as an addition, i.e., it depends solely on the good deeds of the lower %0aones. And the fundamental Light, VAK, will never be lacking. %0a%0aTHE LETTER ALEPH %0a%0a38. The letter Aleph stood outside and did not enter to appear before the %0aCreator. The Creator said to it: "Why do you not come to me like all the %0aother letters?" Aleph replied: "Because I saw all the letters leaving your %0apresence without the desired answer. And besides, I saw You presenting the %0aletter Bet with this great gift. And, indeed, the King of the universe cannot %0atake back his gift and give it to another!" The Creator replied: "Although I %0awill create the world by the letter Bet, it is you who will stand at the head %0aof all the letters, and there shall be no unity in Me, but through you alone; %0aall accounts and deeds of this world shall always begin with you, and all of %0aunity shall be in you alone." %0a%0aAs we already know, all the letters' questions are Aliyat MAN— their individual %0arequests, prayers, desires to ascend to the Creator. And the Creator's answers %0a%0a%0a%0a176 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0ato them are called Yeridat MAD— the descent of the Light from Above, giving %0astrength and abundance according to the letters' requests. The great perfection %0ain the letter Aleph stems not from the lower ones' request for spiritual ascent and %0acorrection, but from a force (Light) descending from Above and elevating those %0athat dwell below. %0a%0aThis is why from the beginning of correction to its end, Aleph (unlike the %0aother letters, whose properties fuel the process of correction during the 6,000 %0ayears) is never stimulated to raise its request to the Creator. And only if the Light %0athat bestows strength for spiritual ascent descends from Above and begins to %0ashine upon Aleph will it be stimulated. However, this will only take place at the %0aend of correction. %0a%0aAleph did not raise its plea (MAN) to the Creator, for it saw that all the other %0aletters asked, but to no avail, for there was an opposite property in the system %0aof the impure forces against each of their properties. Therefore, Aleph decided %0athat it was no better than the rest, that there is a corresponding impure force %0aagainst it as well. %0a%0aFurthermore, it raised no requests (MAN) to the Creator because it saw that %0athe Creator decided to create the world with the letter Bet, mercy. And since it %0ahad no doubt that His decision was irrevocable, it decided not to ask Him. %0a%0aAlthough it is true that the world was already created with the property of %0aBet, and that the Creator will not turn His gift over to another letter, the Partzuf %0athat was created by the property of Bet is incomplete, small, VAK without a head. %0aAnd since a Partzuf needs a head in order to reach the state of Gadlut, which is %0apossible only when the Partzuf is filled not only with the Light of Mercy (Has- %0asadim), but also with the Light of Wisdom (Hochma), more letters are necessary %0afor the connection, conception and birth of a new Partzuf, a new state. %0a%0aA state of Gadlut can only be achieved with the help of the property of the %0aletter Aleph. Only Aleph can bring a Partzuf to Gadlut, to supplement its body, %0aVAK, with a head, GAR, Mochin— the Light of Hochma. The letter Aleph brings %0athe union between ZA and Malchut in a face-to-face position, whereas previously, %0ain Katnut, while being filled with only the Light of Mercy, ZA and Malchut were %0aconnected back-to-back. This is why Alef>h creates a head for all the letters, and %0ahence stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%0aThe Creator said: " That is why My Unity in the world is expressed only through %0athe property of the letter Aleph. Furthermore, all rewards and punishments, %0adistancing and drawing nearer, as well as the aspiration for spiritual correction %0a(Teshuvah), all of which lead to the achievement of the end of correction, will %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%0a%0a%0a177 %0a%0a%0a%0aonly happen by the property of the Aleph. I have made Bet the basis of the Partzuf %0aso that it would be in no way dependent on the deeds of the lower ones. Thus, %0aeven if they begin to sin, those above will remain unaffected." %0a%0aHe continued: "But the Light in you, Aleph, is directly related to the actions %0aof the lower ones. So if they sin, the Light of Wisdom (the Light of GAR in %0ayou) will immediately disappear. But if they correct their actions (Teshuvah), the %0aLight of Hochma will return. And My unity with all the creatures at the end of %0acorrection will only be realized through the letter Aleph." %0a%0aLetters are Kelim (plural for Kli— vessel), desires. And this refers to both the %0aindividual letters of the alphabet and those that form words. In the names of %0aspiritual objects, letters signify the force of their desire, which the Light can fill. %0aLetters of a simple name, without filling, designate its basis without Light— Kli %0aof Auiut zero with the Light of Nefesh. Letters of a fulfilled name designate the %0amagnitude of desires that are filled by Light. %0a%0aThere are two sources of letters: Yod and Aleph. Yod is a genuine source, for %0awhen we write something, we begin with a dot (Yod), and then, as we proceed %0afrom the dot in one of the four directions, we get a line. Letters are Kelim, %0adesires, in which the Light (pleasure) is received. %0a%0aA desire for something specific may only emerge if: (i %0aunconscious desire is filled with delight, and (ii) the delight exits the desire %0aIt is the memories (Reshimot) of past pleasures that lead to the emergence of a %0atrue desire to receive it, to feel it once more. And this is the very desire thai %0ais called Kli. %0a%0aA filled Kli cannot be called a desire, for it is satisfied. Therefore, expulsion of %0aie Light and sensation of spiritual descent constitute the period of the creation %0aew Kelim for future receptions of Light, for new attainments. Because the %0afirst restriction is the reason for the disappearance of Light from all the vessels %0a%0a%0a%0aHowever, the second restriction is the only true root of all the worlds, %0abecause the first restriction was only made on a point, (Phase Four, Malchut, %0athe fourth letter Hey in the Creator's name HaVaYaH). The second restriction, %0ahowever, was made on Bina, in whom the two points, Bina and Malchut, were %0ajoined. The union of the two points forms a line, either vertical or horizontal. If %0ait is a horizontal line, it is called "firmament" or Parsa. %0a%0aThe sum of consequences of both the first and second restrictions forms %0aa slanted line (\); GE (Keter-Hochma) is depicted to its right, and AHP (Bina- %0aZA-Malchut) to its left. Keter-Hochma remain on their previous level and are %0a%0a%0a%0a178 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0adesignated by the letter Yod, the first root of the world, whereas, a result of the %0asecond restriction, designated by a slanted line (\), Bina-ZA-Malchut fell to a lower %0alevel. And since the letter Yod is the first, though a very remote root of the worlds, %0aand all the worlds were created afterwards and in accordance with the law of the %0asecond restriction, the letter Aleph stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%0aThe kind of Light that fills the spiritual Kli or Partzuf can also be seen from %0aits designation: if it is filled with the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), the filling %0ais designated by the letter Yod; and if it is filled with the Light of Mercy (Ohr %0aHassadim), it is the letter Aleph. %0a%0a39. The Creator made the Upper letters, which refer to the Sefira Bina, %0alarge, and the lower letters that refer to Mcdchut— small. Therefore it is said: %0a"BeresHeet Barah" (in the beginning He created)— two words that begin with %0aBet, and then Elokim Et (the Creator Himself)— two words that begin with %0aAleph. The first set of Aleph and Bet are letters of Bina, and the second set %0aof Aleph and Bet are letters of Malchut. And they should mutually affect one %0aanother with their properties. %0a%0aWhen the Upper One wishes to give Light to the lower one, it should clothe %0ain the lower one, signified by the first two letters Bet and the two letters Aleph %0ain the first four words of the Torah. For the first, Upper Bet is Bina, the second, %0alower Bet is ZA, and the first Bet clothes into the second one. %0a%0aSimilarly, the first Aleph refers to Bina and clothes into the second Aleph in %0aZA so as to fill it with Light. Therefore, the two letters Bet are like one letter Bet %0aand the two letters Aleph are like one letter Aleph, since the lower letter merely %0aconstitutes the influence of the Upper One, which tells us that the Upper Partzuf %0afills the lower one. %0a%0aThe world cannot be created with Aleph, for the word Arm (cursed) begins %0awith it, and had the world been created with Aleph, the impure forces, called %0a"cursed," would have received great power from the pure forces, called Baruch %0a(blessed). This is why the world (Nukva of ZA) is created with the letter Bet. %0aLikewise, Adam in Nukva of ZA is also created by the power of Bet. Thus, Malchut %0aof the world of Atzilut constitutes the root of all creation, all the worlds, and all %0athat inhabit them. %0a%0a%0a%0aSupernal Wisdom %0a%0a%0a%0a40. Rabbi Yudai asked, "What does the word BERESHEET mean?" It is %0athe wisdom, upon which the world, ZA, is established to enter the concealed %0asupernal secrets, namely the Light of Bina. Here are the six Supernal and %0agreat properties, VAK de Bina, from which everything emerges. The six river %0amouths, VAK de ZA, that flow into the Great Sea (Malchut) were formed from %0athem. The word BERESHEET consists of the words BARAH (created) and %0aSHEET (Aramaic: six), meaning that six properties were created. Who created %0athem? He who is unmentioned, concealed, and unknown: Arich Anpin. %0a%0aThere are two types of Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) in the world of Atzilut: %0a%0a1. The original Light, Ohr Hochma of AA, called "the concealed Ohr %0aHochma." This Light of Hochma is present only in Partzuf AA and %0adoes not spread to the lower Partzufim. %0a%0a2. Ohr Hochma that descends via thirty-two paths from Bina, who ascended %0ato Rosh de AA to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Hence, the %0aword Beresheet means Be-Resheet, with-Hochma. However, this is not %0athe true Ohr Hochma that is concealed in AA, but rather the Light that %0adescends via thirty-two paths from Bina to ZA and sustains ZON. %0a%0aIt is written that the world is established on the "concealed supernal secrets," %0afor when ZON (called "world") receive the Light of Hochma of thirty-two paths, %0athey ascend to AVI, the concealed supernal secrets. Hence, it is said that ZON %0aenter the concealed supernal secrets and attain the degree of AVI, as the lower %0aone that ascends to the Upper One becomes equal to it in its properties. %0a%0aThe word BERESHEET, besides being divided into BE-RESHEET, is also %0adivided into BARAHSHEET (in Hebrew, both words are spelled the same), %0awhich translates as CREATED SIX— created six Sefirot (properties), called VAK %0a(abbreviation of the words Vav Ketzavot, six extremities/ properties of ZA, from %0awhich all creatures emerge). %0a%0a%0a%0a179 %0a%0a%0a%0a180 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Sefira Bina fulfills the function of the Sefira Hochma, the source of Ohr %0aHochma for ZA. Because Maichut ascended to Bina, and Bina departed from Rosh %0ade AA and became like its Guf (body), she cannot receive the Ohr Hochma of AA. %0a%0aBut then, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, human beings who %0aare spiritually present in the worlds of BYA, Bina returns to Rosh de AA, receives %0aOhr Hochma from AA, passes it to ZON, and ZON pass it to all the worlds. It %0afollows that all the worlds emerged from these six properties (extremities), into %0awhich Bina was divided. %0a%0aIt is therefore written that all six riverheads originate from Bina, and descend %0ainto the Great Sea. Bina's division into six properties, VAK, when she exits Rosh %0ade AA, is called "six sources," for this is only a source of Light for ZA. But then, %0awhen Bina returns to Rosh de AA, they become Ohr Hochma, called the rivers that %0adescend to Partzuf ZA. %0a%0aAnd they are called "six rivers," as it is written: "He will drink off the brook %0ain the way; therefore, will he lift up the head" (Tehilim, 110:7). Afterwards, ZA %0apasses this Light into the Great Sea, to his Nukva. The rivers and brooks signify %0athe Light of ZA. VAK de Bina is considered the sources of the Light of Wisdom, %0aHochma, for it emerged from Bina in the form of VAK with the sole purpose of %0acreating a source of Light for ZON. And had Bina not emerged, ZON would %0ahave had no chance of receiving the Light. %0a%0aThe word Beresheet has several meanings: Bere = Barah— created six properties %0awithout Ohr Hochma, as the word Barah signifies concealment. Hence, the word %0aBeresheet has two meanings: %0a%0a1. Hochma, as the word Resheet means Hochma. %0a%0a2. Barah Sheet, which shows how the Sefira Hochma was divided into six %0aparts without a Rosh, without Ohr Hochma. These six parts are the %0asource of Light for ZON (called the "world"), and these six parts of ZA %0atogether with Maichut are called the "seven days of creation." %0a%0aHowever, since the word Barah is inside the word Beresheet, this means that %0ait was created by "Him who is concealed and unknown," i.e., the concealed %0aHochma of Arich Anf>in, for it expelled Bina from its Rosh and turned her into %0aVAK. In other words, it created the six parts described in Beresheet. %0a%0aBeresheet designates Hochma. The Light cannot descend to ZA until Ima-Bina %0acomes outside, for because of Tzimtzum Bet, ZAT de Bina fell to ZON. Hence, when %0aBina is in Gadlut, ZA receives Ohr Hochma in his Kelim, the desires of Bina. The word %0aBarah in Beresheet = Barah Sheet also means Bar (Hebrew, to exit, to transcend).

diff:1688307209:1688307209:=1,4137d0%0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 22. Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba said: "In the first four words of the Torah, IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING THE CREATOR CREATED Et - Beresheet Barah Elokim %0a%3c Et, the first two words begin with the letter Bet, and the following two begin %0a%3c with Aleph" (The letter Aleph is pronounced both as "A" and "E"). It is said %0a%3c that when the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still %0a%3c concealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator %0a%3c gazed into the letters and played with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the language of Kabbalah, the same sentence appears in the following %0a%3c way: when the Creator (Bina) decided to create the world (ZON of the world %0a%3c of Atzilut), the Kelim of ZON (Zeir Anpin and Nukva) were still in Bina. Hochma %0a%3c and Bina (Aba ve Ima - AVI) are called 2,000 years. Before the creation of the %0a%3c world (the birth of ZON), all the letters (the Kelim of ZON) existed in AVI in %0a%3c the form of MAN, and MAN always stimulates a desire in the Upper One to %0a%3c attend to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c With regard to the lower Partzuf, the Upper One is called the Creator, %0a%3c for it truly begets it, and whatever the lower one receives, comes directly from %0a%3c its Upper One. Moreover, one may say that this is all that the Upper One %0a%3c desires, its entire existence is meant exclusively for the lower one. Therefore, %0a%3c the Upper One always waits for the lower one's genuine request for the desire %0a%3c to ascend spiritually, which is called MAN. Provided this desire is sincere, the %0a%3c Upper One immediately responds and passes the powerful Light of correction %0a%3c to the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the lower one is ZON of the world of Atzilut, and all that is below %0a%3c this Partzuf (all the worlds of ABYA and our world) is considered a part %0a%3c of it, AVI of the world of Atzilut constitute the Upper Partzuf. The desires %0a%3c and properties of ZON are called "letters," and here The Zohar explains the %0a%3c properties that ZON (the spiritual worlds and our world, we ourselves) were %0a%3c %0a%3c 117 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 118 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c created with, which properties are desirable, which require correction, and %0a%3c how this correction is achieved. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the properties of the future Creature are determined by the %0a%3c Creator's purpose in creating it, it is said that even before the creation of %0a%3c the world, the Creator played with the letters. The word "played" suggests %0a%3c that the Creator's interaction with the Creature is like His game with the %0a%3c leviathan (the legendary sea monster), with the property that is opposite %0a%3c from Him. At the end of correction all the letters unite and combine into %0a%3c the one name of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of the Hebrew alphabet indicates the descent of the Direct %0a%3c Light from Above, the Inner Light that fills the Partzuf. The reverse order of %0a%3c the letters from the end of the alphabet alludes to the ascent of the Returning %0a%3c Light. The direct order of the alphabet refers to mercy, whereas the reverse %0a%3c order— to the strict law and restrictions on using egoistic desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Adam sinned, the letters detached themselves from him, and only %0a%3c the letters Shin and Tav (the Kelim for the Light of VAK of Nefesh) remained in %0a%3c him. The Kelim for the Light of Neshama are represented by the letters from %0a%3c Aleph to Yod; the letters from Yod to Ku/ are the Kelim for the Light of Ruach, and %0a%3c the letters Kuf and Reish— the Kelim for GAR of Nefesh— disappeared from him. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why Adam gave his son, born after his sin, the name SHeT(Seth): Shin- %0a%3c Tav, according to the two last letters of the alphabet— the Kelim that remained %0a%3c in him. The Kli Shin-Tav are only fit for the Returning Light from below %0a%3c upwards, but not for the reception of the Upper Light from Above downwards. %0a%3c However, after it receives Yesod of Zeir Anpin (the letter Yod), Shin-Tav turns into a %0a%3c combination Shin- Yod- Tav. And if the Creator creates the world by the letter Bet, %0a%3c it then enters between Shin and Tav and forms the word Shahhat (Sh-B-T), the %0a%3c state of spiritual perfection, the goal of creation. For this reason, the first word %0a%3c in the Torah— Beresheet consists of: Bara (created) Sh(in)-Y(od)-T(av). %0a%3c %0a%3c 23. When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet %0a%3c came to Him in reverse order from last (Tav) to first (Aleph). The letter Tav %0a%3c entered first and said, "Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, %0a%3c to create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your %0a%3c ring, called EmeT (truth), that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You %0a%3c are called truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with %0a%3c the letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit %0a%3c the world that I conceived to be created by your properties, since you are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 119 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c destined to be marked on the foreheads of the truly faithful who fulfill all %0a%3c of Torah from Aleph to Tav (from the first letter to the last), and perished %0a%3c because of you" (Talmud Bavli, Shabbat, 55) %0a%3c %0a%3c What does a particular name of the Creator mean? The name of the spiritual %0a%3c object indicates the way one can receive the Light that fills it, the way one can %0a%3c attain its spiritual degree. Generally speaking, the twenty-two letters are the ten %0a%3c Sefirot-Kelim in the Ibur (embryonic phase) of the future Partzuf in the Sefira %0a%3c Yesod, for that is where the screen of the embryo of the new Partzuf is located. %0a%3c That is why Yesod is called a "number," as it measures the size of a new Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bearing in mind that each name determines specific spiritual properties %0a%3c and states of an object, one can understand what is meant by a change of name, %0a%3c place, or action. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH is the basis of all the letters, but the filling of each letter clarifies the %0a%3c letter itself. The filling of a letter is heard as the letter is pronounced. As we read %0a%3c the letter Yod in the word HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey), we actually pronounce %0a%3c three sounds (y-o-d); although we write only one letter, the sounds "o-Vav" and %0a%3c "d-Dalet" are heard together with the sound "y." When we say "Hey," the sound %0a%3c "ey"— Yod or "ey"— follows the sound "h." Therein lies the clarification of the %0a%3c name HaVaYaH in the process of its emergence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's form-properties are revealed in His deeds; hence, the three %0a%3c lines in Bina (the Creator) are imprinted and act in His created beings (the lower %0a%3c worlds) as a seal and its imprint. Therefore, the name MB exists in Bina, as well %0a%3c as in ZA and Malchut. However, in ZA, this name is divided into the ten sayings %0a%3c and thirty-two forces of creation of Elokim, which create Malchut, the creature. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina is designated by the letter Mem, Malchut— by Bet; the name MB designates %0a%3c the creation of Malchut by Bina. The letter Aleph designates ZA, which passes all %0a%3c the twenty-two letters (from Ale£>h to Tav) to Malchut (Bet). This is why Malchut %0a%3c is called ET (Aleph pronounced as 'E'-Tav). %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is the central part of creation and its purpose. She is the only %0a%3c creation and includes all the worlds with all that inhabits them, us included. %0a%3c Depending on its states, parts of Malchut or Malchut herself (which is one and %0a%3c the same) have different properties designated by the different letter combina- %0a%3c tions. For this reason, Malchut's parts receive various "codes" (combinations) %0a%3c of letters (properties) or names. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the words in the world originate here, in Malchut. There is not a %0a%3c single property in the world that is not included in Malchut. Each property of %0a%3c Malchut, each of the creatures (for all creatures are her parts) is designated by %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 120 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the property that distinguishes it from the others, by the unique set of letters- %0a%3c properties that forms its name. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut is called Shechina (Divinity), as she is filled with the Light, Shochen %0a%3c (Dweller— the Creator). The Creator is called Shochen when Malchut feels Him %0a%3c as such, within her. If man, being part of Malchut, purifies himself of egoism, %0a%3c either partially or completely, and thus fills his corrected desires with the Light %0a%3c (the Creator), he becomes part of the Shechina. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of four parts that are named by their properties (also called %0a%3c faces): face of a lion, face of an ox, face of an eagle, and face of a man. Alternately, %0a%3c Malchut is likened to a spiritual kernel, surrounded by four shells, which corre- %0a%3c spond to the four Klipot (impure forces): Ruach Se'ara (Stormy Wind), Anan Gadol %0a%3c (Great Cloud), Esh Mitlakachat (Blazing Flame), and Noga (Radiance). %0a%3c %0a%3c Kabbalah can describe spiritual actions either as names of Sefirot and %0a%3c Partzufim or as names of HaVaYaH, EKYEH, and so forth, with their fillings %0a%3c and Gematriot (plural for Gematria— the numeric value). Although the most %0a%3c frequently used language is that of Sefirot and Partzufim, sometimes the %0a%3c language of HaVaYaH with its fillings can also be applied, even in parallel or %0a%3c simultaneously with the former. %0a%3c %0a%3c Most Kabbalistic terms are composite: Maatzil (the Creator) comes from the %0a%3c word Tzel (shadow), as the Creature emerges from the Creator's concealment, %0a%3c from His restrictions. Another name for the Creator is Boreh (combination of %0a%3c Bo— come and Re 'eh— see). %0a%3c %0a%3c A name denotes attainment. Upon attaining an object, man gives it a %0a%3c name. Similarly, man gives a name to the Creator according to the property %0a%3c that he attains, depending on how he feels the Creator. There are several %0a%3c kinds of names to the Creator, based on His properties. For example, the %0a%3c Creator's name EMET— "Truth" is based on the sensations of His Light within %0a%3c the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Below are the names of the Creator with the corresponding names of %0a%3c the Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c - Keter: Aleph-Hey-Yod-Hey (EKYEH) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hochma: Yod-Hey (YA) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Bina: HaVaYaH with the punctuation Segol-Holam-Hirik, as Elokim: Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c (Yod-Vav-Dalet) - Hey (Hey-Yod) - Vav (Vav-Ahph-Vav) - Hey (Hey-Yod). %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hesed: Aleph-Lamed = EL (pronounced KEL) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Qevura: Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem (ELOKIM) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 121 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c - Tifferet: Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey (HaVaYaH without punctuation) %0a%3c %0a%3c - Netzah: HaVaYaH TZEVAOT %0a%3c %0a%3c - Hod: ELOKJM TZEVAOT %0a%3c %0a%3c - Yesod: Shin-Dalet-Yod = SHADDAY %0a%3c %0a%3c - Malchut: ADONAY (pronounced ADM) %0a%3c %0a%3c Merging the two worlds, the Upper and the lower, is designated by the %0a%3c words HaVaYaH- ADM, implying the ascent of Malchut-ADM to the level of %0a%3c Bina-HaVaYaH with the punctuation of Elokim. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name ZA of HaVaYaH comes from the right line (Hesed), and the name %0a%3c ADNI, from the left line (Gevura). Joining of these two lines forms the middle %0a%3c line, where the Light of Hochma shines on account of the presence of the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim from the right line. Such state is designated by a combination of the %0a%3c two names Ha VaYaH-ADM: %0a%3c %0a%3c YOD-Aleph-HEY-Dalet-VAV-Nun-HEY-Yod. The union (Zivug) of ZA and his %0a%3c Nukva is designated by mixing the two names. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVdYaH-ADM: Yod-Aleph-Hey-Dalet-Vav-Nun-Hey-Yod. The opening Yod %0a%3c indicates the Light of Hochma in ZA, the Yod at the end refers to the passing of %0a%3c this Light to Nukva. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascended to Bina, and governs %0a%3c Bina and ZA with her desire. Since it is impossible to receive the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in the three Sefirot—Bina, ZA, and Malchut, which are governed by Malchut's %0a%3c egoistic desire, the Light of Hochma is absent in the Partzuf, and only the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim is present. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is designated in the following way: the letter Yod enters the word Light %0a%3c (Ohr contains the letters Aleph- Vav-Reish, signifying the Light of Hochma), and %0a%3c forms the word Avir (air, containing the letters Aleph- Vav-Yod-Reish), signifying %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim. If the Partzuf returns to the Gadlut state, the letter Yod %0a%3c exits it, and it is refilled with the Light of Hochma. Consequently, Avir (air) %0a%3c becomes Ohr (Light). %0a%3c %0a%3c Unfilled HaVaYaH designates Partzuf Keter. HaVaYaH with the filling of %0a%3c AB (72) designates Partzuf Hochma (AA). HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG (63) %0a%3c designates Partzuf Bina (AVI). Together, these three HaVaYaH form MB (42) %0a%3c letters— the sacred name of the Light that corrects the souls by its influence on %0a%3c the Kli, the screen. %0a%3c %0a%3c All that was created is the desire to receive pleasure, which we call "creature." %0a%3c Only this desire was created, and nothing else. All the worlds and all that inhabits %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 122 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c them, our world with everything within it, are but degrees of the desire to %0a%3c receive pleasure. The intensity of the desire determines its place in the spiritual %0a%3c realm, where all creation and our world— as its lowest point— are located. Man's %0a%3c actual location (the world, his spiritual degree) determines the particular kind %0a%3c of pleasure he desires, how he chooses to enjoy. %0a%3c %0a%3c In order for the creature to emerge from the Creator, the Light emanating %0a%3c from Him must descend through four stages, whereas the fifth stage already %0a%3c perceives itself as a separate and independent (from the Creator) desire to enjoy %0a%3c precisely the Light emanating from the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon emerging from the Creator— a result of a sequential emanation of %0a%3c His Light— the desire to receive pleasure (Kli-vessel) also consists of five parts %0a%3c designated by the letters: the tip of the Yod, Yod, Hey, Vav, Hey. These five parts %0a%3c (four letters) are called the Creator's name HaVaYaH, because the Kli gives the %0a%3c Creator a name according to its sensation of Him, according to its sensation of %0a%3c the Light that fills it. The Light that fills the Kli is called "filling." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kli created by the Creator is divided into five parts, called "worlds." %0a%3c Each world is in turn divided into five more parts, called Partzufim (faces). Then, %0a%3c each Partzuf (singular for Partzufim) consists of five parts called Sefirot. In all, %0a%3c there are 5x5x5= 125 spiritual objects or degrees from the lowest degree to %0a%3c the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Partzuf consists of five parts (Sefirot), designated by a dot and four %0a%3c letters: Keter-dot + Hochma-Yod + Bina-Hey + ZA-Vav + Malchut-Hey = HaVaYaH. %0a%3c The difference between each of the 125 Partzufim lies in the type of Light that fills %0a%3c them, whereas the core of the Kli, the letters HaVaYaH, remain the same. A desire %0a%3c cannot appear unless the Creator's Light had previously passed through the five %0a%3c stages; only the fifth stage is considered a birth of a new creation (desire). %0a%3c %0a%3c The whole universe (all the worlds) is nothing but the ten Sefirot or the %0a%3c Creator's name HaVaYaH. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIRA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTER %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WORLD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LIGHT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A dot, the tip of the letter Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Galgalta %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AK %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yechida %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c AB %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Atzilut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Haya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Neshama %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yetzira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ruach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BON %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Assiya %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 123 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c A filling of HaVaYaH with Light is referred to as its revelation. Thus, the %0a%3c letters emerge from the state of concealment when they are not filled. In all there %0a%3c are five Partzufim: Keter (Galgalta), AB, SAG, MA and BON. The first— Partzuf %0a%3c Keter— is the main one and the source of all the rest. Its ten Sefirot is plain (inner) %0a%3c HaVaYaH, for each of the four letters of its HaVaYaH comes outside, revealing %0a%3c a new Partzuf that clothes it. %0a%3c %0a%3c So then, out of Partzuf Keter-Galgalta, from the letter Yod comes Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma (AB), from the letter Hey— Partzuf Bina (SAG), from the letter Vav— %0a%3c Partzuf ZA (MA), and from the letter Hey— Partzuf Malchut (BON). Thus Partzuf %0a%3c Keter is designated by plain HaVaYaH, and the Partzufim that clothe it are %0a%3c designated by filled HaVaYaH. The recording of HaVaYaH with the Light %0a%3c that fills it is called Miluy (filling). For the purposes of brevity when naming %0a%3c a Partzuf, the notion of Gematria was introduced. Gematria is the numerical %0a%3c value of the Light that fills the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wisdom (Hochma) is called calculation (Heshbon), Gematria. A calculation %0a%3c is made only in a place where Light is received: (i) a preliminary calculation is %0a%3c made as to how much Light the Partzuf can receive for the Creator's sake; (ii) %0a%3c the Light is received in accordance with the calculation; (iii) calculation of the %0a%3c received amount, called Miluy, Gematria. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut cannot receive the Light of Hochma without the Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c and in that event, Hochma cannot shine in her. Then Malchut ascends to Bina %0a%3c and becomes like an embryo inside of her, by which she receives the right %0a%3c line— Hassadim. Upon joining the past and the present states, Malchut receives %0a%3c Hochma into Hassadim, and the Light of Hochma shines in her. All these actions %0a%3c of Malchut are accompanied by calculations, called Gematriot. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Gematria (numerical value) of the Partzuf unfilled with the Light, the %0a%3c Gematria of the empty HaVaYaH is as follows: %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH = Yod + He;y + Vav + Hey = 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26. The Gematria of a %0a%3c filled HaVaYaH is formed by filling each letter; In Hebrew, each letter has a full %0a%3c name: A-Aleph, B-Bet, etc.. Hence, there are four kinds of fillings in HaVaYaH: %0a%3c 1) AB, 2) SAG, 3) MA and 4) BON. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) HaVaYaH with the filling of AB: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Yod + Vav = 6 + 10 + 6 = 22 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 124 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In all: 20 + 15 + 22 + 15 = 72 = AB, where "A" designates the letter Ayin = 70, %0a%3c and not Aleph = 1. HaVaYaH filled with this Light is called Partzuf AB (Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma), for the letter Yod with its filling signifies the Light of Wisdom, Ohr %0a%3c Hochma. Such a filling is called "HaVaYaH with the filling of Yod." %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) HaVaYaH with the filling of SAG: the Partzuf that is filled with Light of %0a%3c Mercy, Ohr Hassadim, is called SAG, for its Gematria is this: %0a%3c %0a%3c SAG = Samech (60) + Gimel (3) = 63: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 10 + 6 + 4 = 20 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 %0a%3c He?: Hey + Yod = 5 + 10 = 15 %0a%3c %0a%3c In all: 20 + 15 + 13 + 15 = 63 = Samech + Gimel = SAG %0a%3c %0a%3c If the Kelim and their filling originate from the first restriction, the letter %0a%3c Yod is present in the filling of HaVaYaH. And if the Kelim are filled with the %0a%3c Light of the second restriction, it is the letter Aleph, present in the filling of %0a%3c HaVaYaH. The difference between the Gematriot of AB and SAG lies in the %0a%3c filling of the letter Vav. Gematria of Vav in Partzuf AB is twenty-two (from the %0a%3c filling of Ohr Hochma), whereas Gematria of Vav in Partzuf SAG is thirteen (from %0a%3c the filling of Ohr Hassadim). From the aforesaid, it is clear that Partzuf AB %0a%3c originates from the first restriction, whereas the letter Vav (ZA) in Partzuf SAG %0a%3c originates from the second restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) HaVaYaH with the filling of MA: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey: Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Aleph + Vav = 13 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Aleph = 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 6 + 13 + 6 = 45 = Mem (40) + Hey (5) = %0a%3c MA (the letter Hey is pronounced as "ah"). %0a%3c %0a%3c 4) HaVaYaH with the filling of BON: %0a%3c Yod: Yod + Vav + Dalet = 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a%3c Vav. Vav + Vav =12 %0a%3c Hey. Hey + Hey = 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c Such a filling of HaVaYaH is called 20 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 52 = Nun (50) + %0a%3c Bet (2), pronounced as BON for easier articulation. This is the Gematria of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 125 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Malchut, and it is equivalent to twice the value of the unfilled HaVaYaH: %0a%3c HaVaYaH = 26, and 26 x 2 = 52 = MA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Partzuf Malchut cannot receive the Creator's Light due to the absence of a %0a%3c screen. Instead, it can only passively receive what Partzuf ZA gives it. Hence, the %0a%3c twofold twenty-six indicates that whatever Malchut has comes to her from ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the four kinds of HaVaYaH, it becomes clear that the root of creation %0a%3c is neither Partzuf Hochma nor Bina, but only ZA, as it is the first Partzuf built on %0a%3c the second restriction. %0a%3c %0a%3c The primary ten Sefirot are located in Partzuf Keter, whereas Partzufim AB, %0a%3c SAG, MA, and BON are merely branches stemming from the first Partzuf. %0a%3c However, when the Light spreads within the Partzuf, it contains five inner %0a%3c Lights NRNHY and five outer Lights. The five outer Lights of Bina come out %0a%3c of the right ear, and the five inner Lights of Bina come out of the left. The five %0a%3c outer Lights of ZA come out of the right nostril, and the five inner Lights of %0a%3c ZA come out of the left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the two Malchuyot (plural for Malchut) are remote from one another, %0a%3c as a branch in our world, man's ear holes are also separated and distanced. The %0a%3c two nostrils are separated by a smaller distance, whereas the five inner and outer %0a%3c Lights of the common Light of the Peh (mouth) come out of the same opening. %0a%3c Thus, as they exit the mouth, they collide and interweave, and as a result of their %0a%3c collisions, letters (Kelim) are born. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since twenty-two letters originate from Bina-SAG = Samech + Gimel = 60 + %0a%3c 3 = 63, the opening through which they come out is called 63 + 22 = 85 = Peh + %0a%3c Hey = PeH (mouth). The letters come out of the Peh of ZA, for Yesod of Ima is %0a%3c located there. %0a%3c %0a%3c We received our entire Torah, all of the knowledge about the spiritual %0a%3c worlds, from our Great Patriarchs, who ascended spiritually above our world, %0a%3c sensed the Upper Worlds, and described them to us. This is how we received the %0a%3c whole Torah— both the written and the oral parts. %0a%3c %0a%3c We cannot imagine the spiritual world because our sensory organs cannot %0a%3c detect it. Thus, to describe the objects and concepts still unattainable by us, %0a%3c Kabbalists use several techniques, languages. The whole Torah speaks only %0a%3c of the creation, governing, and correction of the world; never about history, %0a%3c geography, or anything else. As it is said in the Torah itself, the Torah is the %0a%3c sacred names, that is, manifestations of the Creator, the degrees and methods %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 126 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c jbalists, those who ascend to the spiritual world and thus establisl %0a%3c r, convey this information to us using four langua %0a%3c %0a%3c age of the TaNaKh (Torah— Pentateuch, Nevi'im— Pre %0a%3c ets, Ketuvim— Writings/Hagiographa). This is the language of tl %0a%3c written Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The language of laws. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The language of legends, %0a%3c language of Sefirot and Partzufim— the language of Kabbalah. %0a%3c %0a%3c languages speak about the same thing— the attainment of the ( %0a%3c by us, those living in this world. For this is the sole purpose of our creation, and %0a%3c according to the Creator's design, we must devote all of our physical, mental, %0a%3c and spiritual abilities only to it. And if we were to aspire only to this, we would %0a%3c naturally use our language only for this purpose. After all, everything that is %0a%3c an to us is only for the fulfillment of this exclusive goal— the attainment i %0a%3c )r, while still in this life. %0a%3c %0a%3c why the first language mastered by humankind was %0a%3c However, as they distanced from fulfilling their mission, humankind cor %0a%3c other languages. All the other languages in the world have their inner meaning, %0a%3c too, but since their alphabets were not revealed to us by Kabbalists, we study the %0a%3c spiritual forces depicted in the Hebrew alphabet, the source of all the others. %0a%3c %0a%3c Every Partzuf is divided into two parts: right and left. The right part consists of %0a%3c Ramach = Reish - Mem - Chet = 248 parts (organs) filled with the Light of Hassadim; %0a%3c and the left part consists of Shasah = Shin - Samech - Hey = 365 parts (tendons) %0a%3c filled with the Light of Hochma. ZA is called a "voice"; he is generally the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim. But when he joins with Malchut, called "speech," Malchut receives the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim with Hochma from ZA, and thus "speech" is formed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a%3c names of ZA originate from the 70 (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is called %0a%3c "Heaven" and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also called Ruach, %0a%3c owing to the Light of Ruach within them, which ascends to Bina (ears) and %0a%3c transforms into sound: Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a difference between language and alphabet, as in our world there %0a%3c are people who can speak, but cannot read or write. The most ancient spoken %0a%3c language is that of the TaNaKh, which dates back to Adam. The language of laws %0a%3c originated from it, followed by the language of legends. All of these languages %0a%3c combined and each of them in particular are used in our holy scriptures. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language of Kabbalah was the last to develop. It is the most difficult %0a%3c language, since proper understanding of it requires sensing the spiritual categories %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 127 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c that this language narrates. Kabbalah is also the most precise language of all. It is %0a%3c the only language that can accurately render all the spiritual information. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c learn it and grasp its information. And since for many generations there %0a%3c were only a few Kabbalists, unconnected with one another, the language of %0a%3c Kabbalah was the last to evolve. Even today it can only be "learned" directly %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially, Kabbalists enciphered their knowledge of the spiritual world as %0a%3c letters, whose outlines reflected the interrelationships of spiritual forces. In %0a%3c other words, each spiritual degree is characterized by a unique interrelationship %0a%3c of spiritual forces. By assigning each spiritual property with a particular symbol, %0a%3c one can depict the interrelationship, as well as the general product of the union %0a%3c of spiritual forces of each degree, i.e., its essence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, Kabbalists created the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The %0a%3c Zohar pays much attention to analyzing the connection between the letters, which %0a%3c helps a student to synthesize his knowledge and find new ways of discovering %0a%3c spiritual forces and their actions within. %0a%3c %0a%3c As our forefather Avraham writes in his Book of Creation (Sefer Yetzira), letters %0a%3c represent the stones from which the building-word is constructed. As our sages %0a%3c tell us, the world was created with the letters of the "sacred language," each letter %0a%3c representing a certain holy, spiritual, altruistic force of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The properties of this force are reflected in the letter's outline, its %0a%3c importance with regard to other letters, its potential combinations with the %0a%3c others, its potential punctuation marks, its crowns and notations, its numerical %0a%3c value (Gematria) and variations. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this only concerns separate letters and their combinations. There %0a%3c are also certain rules that enable us to determine the properties of spiritual %0a%3c forces not from letters, but from whole words. Moreover, quite often we can %0a%3c replace letters or even parts of a word with similar ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The language itself, the roots of its words, indicate the properties of the %0a%3c spiritual object they describe. For example, Adam originated from Adama— earth, %0a%3c which emphasizes his insignificance, and from the word Adameh— similar (to the %0a%3c Upper One), which emphasizes his eminence. The name Yaakov comes from the %0a%3c word Ekev— to get around (Esau). There are many such examples in the Torah, for %0a%3c everything is named after its root, as after the patronymic name of one's father. %0a%3c %0a%3c Once we have established that certain combinations of letters (Kelim, %0a%3c language of letters) can be used instead of the language of Sefirot and Partzufim %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c through %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from a Kabbalist-teacher. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 128 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c when describing spiritual actions, the entire description of the spiritual worlds %0a%3c amounts to portraying objects and actions in the form of letters and their %0a%3c combinations. This is how the whole of the Torah is written, in words. Thus, %0a%3c %0a%3c a) The shape of each letter and the elements of its structure indicate %0a%3c all the properties and the general state of a spiritual object, Sefira, or %0a%3c Partzuf, which this particular letter depicts; %0a%3c %0a%3c b) The order of letters in a word indicates the connection between %0a%3c spiritual objects, Sefirot, and their shared properties and actions. %0a%3c Attainment of a word's spiritual meaning signifies an ascent to the %0a%3c spiritual level of the object. When that happens, he who attains %0a%3c it becomes this very word, assumes its name. Man's name keeps %0a%3c changing as he ascends the spiritual degrees; it is determined by %0a%3c the degree he is on, as he assumes the name of that degree. It is %0a%3c therefore said that everyone can become like Moshe, i.e., attain the %0a%3c degree called "Moshe"; %0a%3c %0a%3c c) The word itself in its "corporeal" reading, its "corporeal" meaning %0a%3c indicates the spiritual root and its branch— consequence in our world; %0a%3c %0a%3c d) A combination of words indicates an entire spiritual process, which, %0a%3c as a rule, has a corresponding action (commandment) in our world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Names change depending on the aspect that requires clarification: %0a%3c %0a%3c a) By elements of Sefirot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - has none %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - fire %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - water %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - air %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c b) By colors: %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter - has none %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma - white - the basis of all colors %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina - red - most prominent %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA - green - most perfect %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - black - cannot be changed by any other color %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 129 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Colors are present only in the Guf (body) of the Partzuf, but never in the %0a%3c Rosh (head). These colors are projected onto Malchut from Above, and she passes %0a%3c them on to all the lower ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c c) By lines: %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed - right - white %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura - left - red %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet - central, includes all the colors - green %0a%3c %0a%3c Quite often, colors and elements are used instead of the names of Sefirot %0a%3c and their properties: fire, water, air, earth (The Zohar, Vayera, item 32). Malchut %0a%3c is called "earth," but Malchut that ascends with her properties to Bina is called %0a%3c "earth of the Temple." In the Temple, the four sides of the world— Hochrna, Bina, %0a%3c Tifferet and Malchut join the four elements of the world— fire, water, air and %0a%3c earth. Out of the two points of Bina and Malchut, which are joined together, the %0a%3c Creator made one Partzuf— Adam. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four foundations of the world, or the four sides of the world: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Fire %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c North %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shuruk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Left Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Air %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c East %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Middle Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Water %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c South %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Holam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Right Line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Earth %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c West %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut- receives from all %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Four fundamental metals are created as a result of a Zivug of the four %0a%3c foundations with Malchut; gold, silver, copper and iron. All of these names, as %0a%3c well as many others, are used in the Torah instead of the names of the ten Sefirot. %0a%3c Therefore, although the languages of the Torah, legends, the Talmud, and the %0a%3c Scriptures are extraordinarily vivid, only the concise language of Kabbalah %0a%3c provides an accurate description of the spiritual worlds. %0a%3c %0a%3c The four kinds of symbols used with letters: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim— tone modulations used in pronouncing letters— signify the Direct %0a%3c Light, which spreads from Above downwards in the body of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot— letter punctuation marks— signify the Light during its gradual exit %0a%3c from the body of the Partzuf from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tagin— crowns above the letters— represent Reshimot (reminiscences/records) %0a%3c of the previously present Light (Taamim). Tagin originate from GAR de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 130 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Otiot— letters— represent Reshimot of the Light's exit from the body of the %0a%3c Partzuf (Nekudot). Letters originate from Zat de Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c The ten Sefirot are divided into three primary parts— Taamim, Nekudot, %0a%3c and Otiot: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim - Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot - Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c Otiot - ZAT de Bina and ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c According to the Light in them, Sefirot are divided into: %0a%3c %0a%3c Taamim - Hochma %0a%3c Nekudot - Bina %0a%3c Otiot - ZON %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters were created in the following order: the letter Aleph, which was %0a%3c initially on the right side, begot the letter Shin, which emerged from it and %0a%3c moved to the left side. The letter Shin consists of three sides: the left, the middle, %0a%3c and the right. The letter Vav is thereby formed by three letters, and upon joining %0a%3c with Aleph, it formed the word Aleph-Shin = ESH (fire) in the left side. %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the interaction of the right and the left sides these two letters came %0a%3c forth in contradiction between them, as the right line includes water, while the %0a%3c left line includes fire. Their collisions begot the letters Reish, Vav, and Chet, %0a%3c which formed the word Ruach (wind). This wind entered between the two sides %0a%3c (fire and water) and joined them together, thereby establishing the order of the %0a%3c first letters and their perfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, The Zohar offers a general description of the three lines in ZA, %0a%3c designated by the three names of the Creator: El, Elokim and Elokeinu, and then %0a%3c proceeds to clarify the descent of the degrees of filling ZA and Malchut with %0a%3c the Light of Hochma in the form of letter combinations, in the order of the %0a%3c degrees' descent from Above downwards. Mayim - water, Esh - fire, Ruach - %0a%3c wind constitute the three lines in ZA from AVI. This is why the first letters in %0a%3c ZA come from AVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then the following combinations emerged: Aleph revealed Mem from its %0a%3c right side, so Mem stands to the left line of Aleph. Mem revealed Shin as the %0a%3c middle line, as Mem initially consists of the left line, for it exists in the form of a %0a%3c concealed letter Mem in the word Elokim, which pertains to the left line, and so %0a%3c forth. This is how all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet were born. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba 131 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS %0a%3c OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTERS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c NAME %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PRONUNCIATION %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c GEMATRIA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c b,v %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gimel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c g %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Dalet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c d %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c v, [u], [o] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 6 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c T %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c z %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c h %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c t %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (1)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c h,k %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %3c? %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Lamed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (0)8 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Mem %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c m %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 40 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 0)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nun %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c D %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Samech %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 60 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c V %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [a], [e] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 70 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (1)3 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Peh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c p, ph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (r)s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 90 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c p %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c k %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 100 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Reish %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c r %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 200 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c sh, s %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 300 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c n %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c t %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 400 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Aleph and Ayin do not have any particular sound, and only %0a%3c the accompanying punctuation mark determines their pronunciation. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Bet, Chaf and Peh with a dot inside them are pronounced %0a%3c as "b," "k," and "p." The absence of a dot changes their pronunciation to %0a%3c "v," "ch" and "f." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Hey is not pronounced, but rather aspirated. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shapes of the letters Mem, Nun, Tzadik, Peh, Chaf (pronounced %0a%3c MANTZEPACH) change when placed at the end of a word, as seen in the %0a%3c table of letters. %0a%3c %0a%3c The shape, external form of letters: the protruding element of a letter indicates %0a%3c that the Light in this part of the letter is greater than in the other. The filling %0a%3c (Miluy) indicates the height of the degree. A punctuation mark (Nikud) indicates %0a%3c the origin of each part of the Partzuf. whether it came from the Upper Partzuf (and %0a%3c constitutes its part in the present one), from the lower Partzuf, or from itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Kelim-Sefirot themselves are called "letters," and their punctuation %0a%3c marks (Nekudot) indicate the Light that enters and exits them. The Light of Bina, %0a%3c ZA, and Malchut can enter the Kelim, but the Light of Keter or Hochma cannot. %0a%3c A dot above a letter (Holam) signifies the Lights Keter and Hochma, which never %0a%3c clothe the Kli, hence the location of the dot above the letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two horizontally positioned dots (Tzere) allude to Sefirot Hochma and Bina, %0a%3c that Bina does not receive the Light of Hochma, and contains only the Light of %0a%3c Hassadim, the Light of Mercy (AVI back-to-back). Bina herself is also called Tzere, %0a%3c for ZA receives everything from her. If there is a third dot (Segol) between these %0a%3c two dots, it means that ZA raised his request for the Light of Hochma to AVI. %0a%3c Such a request of ZA in AVI is called Daat. Daat receives the Light of Hochma %0a%3c in order to pass it on to ZA. The punctuation mark Kamatz (a "T" shaped mark %0a%3c under the letter) indicates that ZA collects (Mekabetz) the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c A dot indicates Malchut with a reflecting screen, but not a receiving one. %0a%3c Such a form testifies to the absence of Light in the Kli; it is merely a black dot, %0a%3c as the law of restriction rules over it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Hod is an inclusion of Malchut's properties into ZA, out of which %0a%3c ZA makes a whole Partzuf Malchut. The letter Hey in the word Hod signifies Keter %0a%3c in Malchut, and the nine lower Sefirot of Malchut are located among the impure %0a%3c forces that cling to them. This is designated by an elongated leg of the letter Kuf %0a%3c (dipping below the line), which indicates that the impure forces receive their %0a%3c strength from the spiritually pure forces through this element, the Kuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 133 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The white background is a plain, indistinguishable and thereby imperceptible %0a%3c Light (by us). Whatever we can distinguish may only be expressed by restricting %0a%3c the diffusion of this white color. The forms and degrees of its restriction are %0a%3c called letters. That is why we see black outlines on white background, and attain %0a%3c only the black restrictions. %0a%3c %0a%3c We can describe the diffusion of Light in the worlds using attraction and %0a%3c restriction of the Light. And these two forces must act simultaneously. Similarly, %0a%3c when we perceive something in our sensory organs, we only sense it by way of %0a%3c restriction, as the object's surface or a light wave collides with our sensory organ, %0a%3c which restricts its expansion, and can thereby perceive it. %0a%3c %0a%3c The spiritual roots of the forms are as follows: A circumference originates %0a%3c from the first restriction of the Light in the world of Em Sof (Infinity), the %0a%3c first restriction on the diffusion of Light. Since this restriction was equal and %0a%3c uniform, it assumed the form of a circumference. %0a%3c %0a%3c A vertical line, length without width, signifies that the notion is unattainable %0a%3c by us, and is therefore called a "thin line" of the diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c The Light of Hochma can only be received with the help of the screen in Malchut, %0a%3c which creates Returning Light that clothes the Light of Hochma. Therefore, the %0a%3c Upper Light that comes to the Kli is called a line. %0a%3c %0a%3c A horizontal line, width without height: when a vertical line— the diffusion %0a%3c of the Light of Hochma from Above downwards— collides with the screen, their %0a%3c collision (of desires) compels the vertical line to shift into the horizontal line (to %0a%3c the right), resulting in a shape of the English letter L. Its width is determined by the %0a%3c force of the Returning Light that ascends from the screen from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c A rectangle is formed by the interlacing of the descending Light of Hochma %0a%3c and the Returning Light: five vertical descending lines— five Sefirot of the Light %0a%3c of Hochma and five horizontal lines from right to left— five Sefirot of the Light %0a%3c of Hassadim. The size of the rectangle's side is called Amah, consisting of five %0a%3c parts— Tefachim (plural for Tefach). (Both Amah and Tefach are distance measuring %0a%3c units.) This is why we describe the Kli as a rectangle. %0a%3c %0a%3c The two kinds of diffusion of Light, the Light of Hochma and the Returning %0a%3c Light, are called the right and the left cheeks, respectively, which turn into the %0a%3c upper and the lower lips. Since, after the first restriction, the Light may not be %0a%3c received in Malchut, the Returning Light is only received in four parts of the Kli, %0a%3c not in five. This is why there are 4 x 4 = 16 teeth on the lower jaw and 16 teeth %0a%3c on the upper jaw (The Returning Light stems from resistance, from "chewing" %0a%3c the Light before receiving it inside). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 134 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c In the second restriction, a Triangle is formed, as Malchut ascends to Bina %0a%3c and forms a slanted line. Thus the combination of the Direct Light with the %0a%3c Returning Light and restrictions beget various spiritual forms. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light of Hassadirn is defined as "protruding," for a protrusion beyond %0a%3c the limits of a spiritual body means that: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The Light is so great that it comes out by elevating, protruding %0a%3c the limits; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) It originates from the middle line, Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c A cavity in the body occurs due to the following reasons: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) The Light is insufficient; the Light cannot shine there; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) The Light of Hochrna is present, but the lack of Hassadirn prevents it %0a%3c from shining. %0a%3c %0a%3c PUNCTUATION MARKS %0a%3c IN THE HEBREW ALPHABET %0a%3c (NEKUDOTj %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Punctuation Mark %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pronunciation %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kamatz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c T %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Patach %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c a %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Segol %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzere %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shva %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Holam %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c i %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kubutz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c u %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Shuruk %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c u %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c No Mark %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c □ %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Nekudot are defined by three lines: %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE ROSH (HEAD) %0a%3c Kamatz - Keter - right line %0a%3c Patach - Hochma - left line %0a%3c Tzere - Bina - middle line %0a%3c Holam - Tifferet - middle line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 135 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE GUF (BODY) %0a%3c Segol - Hesed - right line %0a%3c Shva - Gevura - left line %0a%3c Shuruk - Tifferet - middle line %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IN THE EXTREMITIES %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hirik %0a%3c Kubutz %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah - right line %0a%3c Hod - left line %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut - middle line (has no designation) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The levels of Nelcudot: %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Above the letters - Light of Neshama %0a%3c In the letters - Light of Ruach %0a%3c Under the letters - Light of Nefesh %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zivug de Nelcudot is the Zivug between Hochma de Aba and Hochma de Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c Zivug de Otiot is the Zivug between Bina de Aba and Bina de Ima. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters combined together designate Returning Light during the screen's %0a%3c ascent from Tabur to Peh. They are combined, for they all ascend to their root, %0a%3c which unites everything, whereas the use of the will to receive, even for the %0a%3c Creator's sake, causes separation. %0a%3c %0a%3c A state of separated letters occurs when the Light enters the Kli (vessel, the %0a%3c letters of HaVaYaH); the four letters thereby separate, since the Light makes %0a%3c a distinction between the Sefirot: depending on their different properties, it %0a%3c clothes in them in different ways. %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH with filling Aleph comes on a screen with Auiut Aleph (thickness %0a%3c one), HaVaYaH with filling Hey comes on a screen with Aviut Bet (thickness %0a%3c two). A plain name refers to Aviut Shoresh (zero thickness) with the Light of %0a%3c Ne/esh. Plain letters refer to a Partzuf with a screen of Aviut Aleph. %0a%3c %0a%3c The truly faithful, who believe in the three fundamentals: the Creator, His %0a%3c Providence and the Torah, need the two lines to be in constant balance for their %0a%3c spiritual advancement. The left line is wisdom, the Light of Hochma that enters %0a%3c the desire to receive, which pertains to the left side, and the right line is faith, %0a%3c the Light of Hassadim (mercy), the altruistic desire to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c Existing in knowledge only means that man is under the rule of the %0a%3c impure forces (Klipa) of the left side, which renders him totally unable to %0a%3c feel the spiritual, leaving him in spiritual darkness. Alternately, existing only %0a%3c in faith means that man is under the rule of the impure forces (Klipa) of the %0a%3c right side that convinces him that he has achieved perfection, that there is %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 136 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c nothing else to work on, nothing to correct within him. This, too, denies him %0a%3c the opportunity to advance. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar continues: And the Creator answered further (the letter Tav): %0a%3c "The word MaveT (death) ends with you. And since these are your properties, %0a%3c you are not suitable for Me to create the world with you." Immediately following, %0a%3c the letter Tav departed from Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The moment the Creator set about creating the world-ZON by selecting %0a%3c their properties, all twenty-two letters of ZON appeared before Him, starting %0a%3c from the last— Tav, and ending with the first, Aleph— the head of all letters. The %0a%3c reason for the letters coming in reverse order is that they constitute the MAN %0a%3c of ZON, the Kelim of ZON, which emerge from below upwards. The usual %0a%3c alphabetical order corresponds to the Light (MAD), which descends from %0a%3c Above downwards. But the order of MAN is opposite to that of MAD, for it %0a%3c ascends from below upwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are none other than desires, properties, and thoughts that, in man's %0a%3c opinion, are suitable for the attainment of the spiritual, the Creator, of His %0a%3c Providence. Man skips from one thought to another: one moment he thinks that %0a%3c it is possible to attain the Upper Worlds with one property, next he believes he %0a%3c can enter the spiritual realms by mastering another property, then he begins to %0a%3c stubbornly observe all the commandments and pray zealously, or disregards all %0a%3c the actions and plunges into contemplation and reading. Sometimes he craves %0a%3c only knowledge, and sometimes only faith, right down to fanaticism. %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as there are two extremes in our world— knowledge and faith, in the %0a%3c spiritual world, as man now consciously ascends the spiritual ladder to the %0a%3c Creator, there is spiritual work in the attainment of knowledge and faith. %0a%3c Hence, Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag's commentary on The Zohar is entitled The %0a%3c Sulam (The Ladder). %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters represents a certain property. At times %0a%3c it seems that the property of the letter Tav is suitable for the attainment of the %0a%3c spiritual; at times he believes that some other letter is more appropriate. This %0a%3c occurs because in the process of his spiritual ascent, man begins to increasingly %0a%3c understand the true Goal of creation and the Creator, which is exactly what is %0a%3c demanded of him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, he continues to sort through it all, until his search yields the truth: %0a%3c only with the help of the letter Bet, which stands at the beginning of the word %0a%3c Berachah (blessing)— contact with the Creator,— only with the help of this force %0a%3c can one achieve the goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 137 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tuaiiy %0a%3c 5 into %0a%3c tually %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, The Zohar tells us how the letters— properties, forces, and desires- %0a%3c come to the Creator. By offering up his prayer (MAN), man asks for some %0a%3c property that seems like a real goal to him. And each letter tries to prove that %0a%3c it is best suited for the attainment of the sensation of the Creator and merging %0a%3c with Him. But the Creator shows that the best and the only letter is Bet, as only %0a%3c it can help man to establish contact with Him. This is why the Torah begins %0a%3c with this letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c The description of the spiritual forces designated by each letter is incredibly %0a%3c deep, and in order to attain full clarity we need to bridge several other preliminary %0a%3c explanations: the creation of the world includes its existence and process of %0a%3c perfection so that the world could attain the goal for which it was created. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator created the world consisting of two contrasting forces; against %0a%3c each pure, altruistic force, He created an impure, egoistic one, which is its equal %0a%3c and opposite. Just as there are four pure worlds ABYA, the Creator created %0a%3c opposite them four impure worlds ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, in our world— the last degree of the world of Assiya— a spiritually %0a%3c lved person that senses the Creator and has entered with his properties %0a%3c piritually pure world, looks no different from an egoistic and spirit %0a%3c developed person, who has not attained the spiritual realm. This means tha %0a%3c one who does not perceive the spiritual is totally unable to differentiate between %0a%3c piritual purity and impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c We see that in our world one cannot advance with the help of the pure %0a%3c forces. On the contrary, it is his egoistic aspirations that provide man with the %0a%3c strength to conquer everything in the world. How often do we see fervent fanatics %0a%3c immersed in their impure desires to capture for themselves both this world and %0a%3c the next, whereas one that aspires to the Creator has no strength for even a %0a%3c slightest spiritual movement! In our world there is no proof or confirmation %0a%3c that man advances on the right path. And under no circumstances should one %0a%3c draw conclusions based on one's life experience or "common sense." %0a%3c %0a%3c So how can a person in this world exist and advance towards the Goal of %0a%3c creation if he is unable to tell good from bad, pure from impure? There is one %0a%3c sign by which one can distinguish purity from impurity: impure forces bear %0a%3c no spiritual fruit. Thus, those that advance through the impure worlds ABYA %0a%3c do not attain anything spiritual, whereas those who are connected to the pure %0a%3c forces reap spiritual fruit on their path. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it is explained in the "Introduction to The Study of Ten Sefirot" (items %0a%3c 19-23), if man advances along the right path, he attains the secrets of the Torah in %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 138 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c five years. The Creator helps those who wish to acquire altruistic i %0a%3c above their own requests, and thus one attains the desired goal, %0a%3c below, man aspires to the Creator with his small desire (MAN), and from Above, %0a%3c the Creator pours onto him tremendous spiritual desires and strength (MAD). %0a%3c %0a%3c This is the only opportunity to check whether or not the path that one %0a%3c is on is correct, whether it leads to altruism or to even bigger egoism. By no %0a%3c means can one consider his well-being, soaring elation, his happiness and %0a%3c :cess in life as proofs of correct advancement. It is precisely in those state %0a%3c perfection, well-being, and contentment that he must ask himse %0a%3c lined the secrets of the Torah?" And until he has attained them, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c e states %0a%3c limself: %0a%3c %0a%3c em ' h ' S %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c an %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c is impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c should always strive for the middle line— a balance of faith and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c knowledge— in the following three notions: the Creator, His Providence, and %0a%3c the Torah. And under no circumstances should he advance by either faith or %0a%3c knowledge alone. If he only wants to attain the Creator, His Providence or the %0a%3c ih, he enters spiritual darkness, for it is impossible to receive the Light ■ %0a%3c %0a%3c Light of Mercy (Ohr Hassadim). %0a%3c %0a%3c ; referred to as the left impure force, "Klipat Esau." %0a%3c strives to advance through faith alone, he enters the impure force of the %0a%3c side, "Klipat Yishmael," which tells him he is in a state of perfection. In this ca %0a%3c he sees no point in his work and is thus unable to continue to advance. %0a%3c %0a%3c In other words, even if one is full of joy, which is exactly what the Torah %0a%3c urges him to feel (to perceive the Creator's Providence with joy, for joy signifies %0a%3c justification of creation, understanding that His Providence is always just and %0a%3c unless he has attained the secrets of the Torah, his path is consider %0a%3c intention "for the Creator's sal %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This article explains the particular properties of the Hebrew letters— how all %0a%3c the letters come before the Creator, each asking Him to create the world with its %0a%3c property. Each of the twenty-two letters represents a spiritual degree in the worlds %0a%3c ABYA, and each believes that its pure spiritual properties are most suitable for %0a%3c the task, that by attaining its degree and acquiring its properties, the inhabitants %0a%3c of the world will be able to elevate the pure forces over the impure ones, so much %0a%3c so that they will reach the end of correction, the Goal of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator answers each letter that against it are the corresponding %0a%3c impure forces, and therefore man will be unable to properly separate the pure %0a%3c forces from the impure ones, and afterwards, utilize the pure forces to achieve %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 139 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the goal. This occurrence repeats itself until the appearance of the letter Bet, %0a%3c which represents the degree called "the Creator's blessing," against which there %0a%3c are no impure forces of any kind. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator consented to create the world with the letter Bet, with its %0a%3c property; for it has no impure counterpart, only Bet presents an opportunity %0a%3c to carry out an analysis between good and evil, to determine when man works %0a%3c for himself and when he works for the Creator's sake. Therefore, only by its %0a%3c force, by its property can the world exist: so as to extract from the "mixture" %0a%3c of one's desires only what's pure, and elevate them above the impure, down to %0a%3c complete eradication of the latter, and the consequent attainment of complete %0a%3c correction of one's nature. %0a%3c %0a%3c As it follows from The Zohar, only the Creator's help, called "a blessing," is %0a%3c the force of man's salvation, the only thing capable of freeing him from the rule %0a%3c of the impure forces. And this force, called "blessing," descends only upon those %0a%3c that advance along the right path. %0a%3c %0a%3c The right path is a combination of three conditions: (i) one's efforts in %0a%3c idying (only!) genuine Kabbalistic sources; (ii) contact with a true Kabbalist, %0a%3c accepts as his teacher; and (iii) contact with like-minded people, who %0a%3c eek spiritual elevation. A more detailed explanation will be provided to serious %0a%3c students only. %0a%3c %0a%3c All twenty-two letters are divided into three degrees: Bina, Zeir Anpin (ZA), %0a%3c and Malchut, since there are no Kelim (letters) above Bina. Twenty-two letters in %0a%3c Bina are called "big," twenty-two letters in ZA are called "medium," and twenty- %0a%3c two letters in Malchut are called "small." %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the three Sefirot of Bina, ZA, and Malchut are further divided into %0a%3c three degrees: The twenty-two letters of Bina contain their own Bina, ZA, and %0a%3c Malchut. Likewise, ZA has his own ten Sefirot, in which his Bina, ZA, and Malchut %0a%3c also contain twenty-two letters. The same applies to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The twenty-two letters of each degree are divided into three types. The letters %0a%3c from Aleph to Tet (1-9) are considered units; these are the nine Sefirot of Bina. %0a%3c The letters from Yod to Tzadik (10-90) are considered tens; these are the nine %0a%3c Sefirot of ZA. And finally, the four letters Kuf, Reish, Shin and Tav (100-400) are %0a%3c considered hundreds; and these are the four Sefirot of Malchut, since Malchut is %0a%3c located below and downwards of Chazeh de ZA, which corresponds in height to %0a%3c the four Sefirot of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina, units, big letters, nine letters: Aleph, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Hey, Vav, %0a%3c Zayin, Chet, Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 140 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA, tens, medium letters, nine letters: Yod, Chaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Sarnech, %0a%3c Ayin, Peh, Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, hundreds, small letters, four letters: Kuf, Reish, Shin, Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, it is known that units are in Malchut, tens are in ZA, and hundreds %0a%3c are in Bina, which contradicts the aforesaid that units are in Bina, tens are in %0a%3c ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. Such inverse dependence is caused by the %0a%3c inverse relationship between the Lights and the Kelim: the lowest Light enters %0a%3c the Highest Kelim. The Upper Kelim are the first to emerge, from Keter down to %0a%3c Malchut (Keter, Hochma, Bina, ZA, and Malchut), whereas the first to enter them %0a%3c is the smallest Light, Ne/esh, followed by Ruach, Neshama, Ha^a and Yechida. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, if there are only units in the Kelim, from Aleph to Tet, then only %0a%3c the Light of Ne/esh is present. And if tens are added to the Kelim, the Light of %0a%3c Ruach appears, and if hundreds are added to the Kelim, the Light of Neshama %0a%3c fills them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why hundreds are defined as Bina, tens as ZA, and units as Malchut. %0a%3c However, with regard to the Kelim, the order is inversed: units are in Bina, tens %0a%3c are in ZA, and hundreds are in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters descend from Bina to ZA and from there to Malchut. When they %0a%3c descend from Bina to ZA, they descend as three lines: 22/3 = 7 letters in each, with %0a%3c the remaining letter being added to the middle line. These twenty-two letters de- %0a%3c scend in three lines to Malchut, which consists of five final letters MANTZEPACH, %0a%3c thereby bringing the total number in Malchut to 22 + 5 = 27 letters. %0a%3c %0a%3c The middle line is called "Heaven," "firmament." Therefore, when The %0a%3c Zohar speaks of letters in the firmament, it means that the two middle lines, %0a%3c 7 + 7 = 14 = Yod + Dalet = Yad (hand) writes all the twenty-two letters in the %0a%3c firmament (ZA) through the middle line. That is how one should interpret the %0a%3c words of the Torah regarding the letters that appear in the sky or having seen the %0a%3c hand that writes the letters in the sky. %0a%3c %0a%3c The twenty-two letters of the Torah are the Kelim to be filled by the Light %0a%3c of NRN. Units— from Aleph to Yod— are the Kli intended for the Light of Bina %0a%3c (Neshama). Tens— from Yod to Kuf— are the Kli meant for the Light of ZA {Ruach). %0a%3c Hundreds— from Kuf to Tav— are the Kli for the Light of Malchut (Ne/esh). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina: Light (100) %0a%3c ZA: Light (10) %0a%3c Malchut: Light (1) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kelim (1) %0a%3c Kelim (10) %0a%3c Kelim (100) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 141 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are the Kelim, into which the Light clothes; in all, there are twenty- %0a%3c two special properties, and thus twenty-two symbols of their description, %0a%3c called letters. Just as the combinations of the twenty-two letters suffice for the %0a%3c description of all existing knowledge, the various couplings, unions (Zivugim of %0a%3c Sefirot) of the twenty-two Kelim, properties, desires of the Partzuf are sufficient %0a%3c for receiving and bestowing Light, fulfilling all spiritual actions and bringing all %0a%3c the letters (man's desires) to correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters represent the various correlations of ZON: %0a%3c %0a%3c a) ZA, consisting of six parts of his extremities, husband to Malchut, %0a%3c designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Yesod— level of an embryo; %0a%3c %0a%3c b) ZA designated by the letter Vav, Sefira Tifferet, consisting of six parts of %0a%3c his hands— level of nursing; %0a%3c %0a%3c c) ZA that stands between AVI, while Nukva must ascend to him, thereby %0a%3c reaching the level of reception of Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c d) ZA, the letter Vav, above him are ten Sefirot Keter-Hochma, below him %0a%3c are ten Sefirot Bina-Tifferet-Malchut—and together they make up the %0a%3c letter Aleph. And the final corrected state will come when Malchut %0a%3c ascends to Keter of ZA (the Upper Yod in the letter Aleph) at the end %0a%3c of correction. When Malchut ascends above Parsa (Vav), she receives %0a%3c the Light herself, whereas when she descends below Vav, she receives %0a%3c from ZA. As Malchut ascends, she forms Taamim (tone marks), when %0a%3c she descends, she is called Nekuda (point), and when she merges with %0a%3c ZA, she is referred to as a point inside Vav (Shuruk). %0a%3c %0a%3c The order of ATBaSH: There is a special combination of letters, e.g. the %0a%3c first with the last ('A' through 'T'), the second with the second last ('B' through %0a%3c 'Sh'), etc., which designate the conditions for diffusion of the Upper Light from %0a%3c Above downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c MANTZEPACH: All the worlds and Partzufim were created with the %0a%3c twenty-two letters of Malchut. The screen is located in the head of the Partzuf, %0a%3c preventing the Light from entering. It repels the Light, calculates how much it %0a%3c can receive for the Creator's sake, and only then accepts it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the five levels of the will to receive that exist in Malchut, in the Guf %0a%3c of the Partzuf, has a corresponding restriction in the screen, located in the Peh, %0a%3c to prevent the Light from entering the body. Therefore, the screen in the Peh %0a%3c consists of five parts, forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 142 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These five restrictive forces of the screen, five exertions of the screen are %0a%3c designated by the five final letters of the alphabet: Mem-Nun-Tzadik-Peh-Chaf %0a%3c (abbreviated as MANTZEPACH). They are called "final letters" because they %0a%3c are written only at the end of words. These forces determine the reception %0a%3c of Light in the body of the Partzuf, and therefore beget the other twenty-two %0a%3c letters (Kelim, corrected desires, which receive the Light). Although the five %0a%3c letters MANTZEPACH are only found at the end of words, in oral speech they %0a%3c represent the five groups of pronunciation of the twenty-two letters. And the %0a%3c letters MANTZEPACH stand at the head of each group. %0a%3c %0a%3c Out of the five letters MANTZEPACH originate five groups of sounds: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Peh-Keter: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the throat; they are %0a%3c called AChHA—Aleph-Chet-Hey-Ayin. Aleph is the Light of Partzuf Keter of Atzilut, %0a%3c concealed from the lower ones and called Atik. Chet is the Light of Partzuf Hochma %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut, called Arich Anpin and also concealed from the lower %0a%3c ones. Hey is the Light of Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut, called Ima (mother), %0a%3c who receives the Light of Hochma from Aba (father) in order to pass it on to her %0a%3c children (ZON). Ayin is the Light of Zeir Anpin 's face. Since the Light of ZA that %0a%3c enters Malchut is called "the Torah," it is said that the Torah has Ayin (70) faces, %0a%3c that the Creator (ZA) has Ayin (70) names. After all, with regard to Malchut, ZA is %0a%3c the Creator. Therefore, seventy souls descended to Egypt, and so forth. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Chaf-Hochma-. a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the palate; %0a%3c they are called GlChiK— Gimel-Yod-Chaf-Kuf. The letters AChHA transfer the %0a%3c Light to the letters GlChiK: Aleph passes the Light to Gimel, which carries reward %0a%3c (Gemul— Gimel) for the righteous. Chet passes the Light of Hochma to Yod, but this %0a%3c Light is concealed. Hey illuminates Chaf with the Light of Bina, which carries %0a%3c joy. Ayin illuminates Kuf. Just as Ayin = 70, as it consists of seven Sefirot, Hesed- %0a%3c Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod-Malchut, each containing ten Sefirot of its own, %0a%3c Kuf = 100, as it consists of ten Sefirot from Keter to Malchut, each consisting of %0a%3c its own ten. Hence, the palate fully complements the throat. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. Nun-Bina: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the tongue, called %0a%3c DaTLaT— Dalet-Tet- Lamed- 'Nun-Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. Mem-ZA: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the lips, called %0a%3c BOMoCH-Bet-Vav-Mem-Cka/. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5. Tzadik-Malchut: a group of four sounds-letters emerges from the teeth, %0a%3c called ZaSSHRaTZ - Zayin-Samech-Shin-Reish-Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c Voice and speech: Voice is formed in ZA, speech— in Malchut. If he who %0a%3c is righteous, and who exists in the worlds BYA, raises his prayers (MAN) to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 143 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut of the world of Atzilut, he causes ZON to ascend to AVI, and unites %0a%3c them in a constant Zivug so as to assure the Light's descent to the lower ones. %0a%3c ZON receives the Light from AVI; this Light is called "voice" and "speech," %0a%3c and this is the power of the righteous— to create the pure and destroy the %0a%3c impure with their voice. %0a%3c %0a%3c Man's speech is conceived in the lungs: as the air exits the lungs and %0a%3c reaches the mouth, it turns to voice, and as it leaves the mouth, it becomes %0a%3c speech. Two lips accept the voice from the two parts of the lungs (the left and %0a%3c the right) and turn it into speech. Each lung consists of five parts so as to %0a%3c pass to the five parts in the mouth: to the guttural letters AChHA, the labial %0a%3c letters BOMoCH, the palatal letters GlChiK, the lingual letters DaTLaT and %0a%3c the dental letters ZaSSHRaTZ. %0a%3c %0a%3c The seven primary Sefirot of ZA are called "Seven Heavens." The seventy %0a%3c names of ZA originate from the seventy (7 x 10) Sefirot of ZA. ZA himself is %0a%3c called "Heaven," and Malchut is called "earth." The Sefirot of ZA are also known %0a%3c as Ruach (because of the Light of Ruach in them), which ascends to Bina (ears), %0a%3c where it turns to sound, with Hochma in the left ear and Hassadim in the right. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TAV %0a%3c %0a%3c Each of the twenty-two letters corresponds to a particular spiritual degree, on %0a%3c which it acts. The letter itself is that spiritual degree. Hence, the letter Tav claims %0a%3c that its properties are the most suitable for the creation of the world, that its %0a%3c properties can bring the world to correction and to the goal of creation, for it %0a%3c defines the property of "truth," the Creator's seal. %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure forces exist solely on account of the miniature Light received %0a%3c from the pure forces; this Light is called Ner Dakik (tiny candle). Without this %0a%3c Light, the impure forces would neither be able to exist nor to function— tempting %0a%3c man with the pleasures they received from the tiny spark of Light that fell from %0a%3c the pure Sefirot. Therefore, the last, lowest pure degree lets a little bit of the %0a%3c Upper Light down to the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Without the support of the pure forces, the impure forces would instantly %0a%3c disappear. A question arises: who needs them to exist and what for? Obviously, %0a%3c the impure forces were created on a par with pure ones by the Creator Himself, %0a%3c for there is no other power in the entire universe besides Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was necessary to create impure forces in order to concentrate them in %0a%3c the enormous desires to receive pleasure, in immense egoism. The system of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 144 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the impure worlds of ABYA serves as a kind of storehouse of desires to receive %0a%3c pleasure, from which, to the extent of his correction, man can take more and %0a%3c more new desires so as to correct them. Thus, by attaching uncorrected impure %0a%3c forces to himself and correcting them, man can gradually ascend higher and %0a%3c higher, up to the level of the Creator. For this purpose the Creator created %0a%3c impure forces and sustains them through the system of pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The impure system of the worlds ABYA exists on the same level, parallel to %0a%3c the pure one. Our world is located under these two spiritual systems. Our world %0a%3c is also called egoistic and impure, but its forces and desires are so insignificant %0a%3c that they are located below the worlds of the impure ABYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c When, with the help of Kabbalah, one surmounts the level of our world's %0a%3c egoism, he enters the pure world of Assiya. And immediately after, the impure %0a%3c world of Assiya begins to influence him, tempting him with its false pleasures. %0a%3c By overcoming the temptations of the impure world of Assiya, one ascends %0a%3c spiritually. But until one surmounts the impure desires of his body, of our %0a%3c world, he will not begin to sense, or enter the spiritual worlds, for he would not %0a%3c be able to withstand the impure forces that act there. %0a%3c %0a%3c Unlike the forces that act in the spiritual world, man in our world is only %0a%3c influenced by the small egoistic force called his "body," his ego. Man can struggle %0a%3c with this force, either winning or losing his battles. But even if he is defeated, %0a%3c man retains that tiny spark of Light (Ner Dakik), which sustains his existence. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag gives the following example: man's work in this world %0a%3c resembles writing on a school blackboard, where any mistake may be wiped off %0a%3c lout harming the writer, where he can make corrections and write anew, %0a%3c le learns to write correctly. Only when he learns to write correctly is %0a%3c to enter the spiritual realm. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, our world is the most insignificant of all. Everyone must begin %0a%3c here, and everyone is bound to return here, and be born again and again until %0a%3c he crosses the boundary between our world and the spiritual one. (There are %0a%3c many additional conditions required for the soul to not descend to this world %0a%3c anymore, and those who will merit, will understand). %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, the vertical line, the leg of the letter Kuf, descends below the writing %0a%3c line, which signifies the Light descending through this letter down to the impure %0a%3c forces. And no other letter descends below the writing line, like the Kuf does. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the impure forces to exist (any creature, whether pure or impure, can %0a%3c only exist by receiving Light), the last, lowest degree of pure forces descends into %0a%3c the impure forces and gives them the Light necessary for their existence and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c s anew, %0a%3c ly is he %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 145 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c realization of their role: to entice man with their pleasures and convince him to %0a%3c act according to the law of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c At first, the left leg of the letter Tav also descended below the writing line. %0a%3c But the Creator saw that the impure forces would then be too closely connected %0a%3c to pure ones, so He severed this connection and returned the left leg of the %0a%3c letter Tav back to the writing line, to the level of the pure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of this shortening, the left leg of the Tav doubled in thickness, %0a%3c as it folded in two, and no Light passes to the impure forces anymore. On the %0a%3c contrary, it even becomes the Creator's seal by holding the impure forces at bay %0a%3c and preventing them from stealing the Upper Light, for as soon as any impure %0a%3c forces touch it, they instantly die. %0a%3c %0a%3c And all the life-force necessary for the sustenance of the impure forces is %0a%3c passed by the Creator through the letter Kuf, because, being the first letter of %0a%3c Malchut, it is remote from them; thus, there is no fear or risk that its connection %0a%3c to the impure forces would become too strong. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of only four letters from Above downwards: Kuf, Reish, %0a%3c Shin, and Tav. Kuf is the first, Tav is the last, and below it are the impure %0a%3c forces. Therefore, if they receive the Light they need according to the thought %0a%3c of creation from Kuf, the furthest letter from them, the impure forces have %0a%3c no way of "stealing" more Light than Malchut, who consists of four letters, is %0a%3c obliged to give them. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why this letter is called Kuf, to show that it gives strength to the %0a%3c impure system of ABYA— a fake (nonexistent) man, just as a monkey (Kof in %0a%3c Hebrew) resembles a human being. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it misleads people by pretending to be the truth and claiming that its %0a%3c path leads to the attainment of spirituality, the Creator, Lishma, the sensation %0a%3c of the Creator. However, the pure forces maintain that only with the help of the %0a%3c Torah can man attain adequate correction of his properties so as to merge them %0a%3c with the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is what the letter Tav claimed: because it is the Creator's seal of %0a%3c truth, it stands at the end of the pure system and does not allow the impure %0a%3c forces to cling to pure ones, and pose as if they are pure. This is why its %0a%3c properties are worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world— so %0a%3c that via the analysis of good and evil, purity and impurity, inhabitants of this %0a%3c world may be sure that by acquiring its properties they will achieve the goal %0a%3c of their creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 146 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The four letters Kuf-Reish-Shin-Tav make up the four Sefirot of Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut: Keter-Hochma-Bina-Tifferet, where Tifferet consists of six Sefirot— %0a%3c Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. But when the letter Kuf is by itself, without %0a%3c Reish-Shin-Tav, the Torah, which spreads to the worlds BYA, also shines upon the %0a%3c impure forces, and the angel of death receives the strength to destroy all that %0a%3c lives. This state is designated by the letter Kuf. But when Malchut is corrected, %0a%3c she is designated by the letter Hey, whose difference from Kuf lies in the long leg %0a%3c of the Kuf (Malchut de Malchut). %0a%3c %0a%3c This long left leg, which turns the Hey into Kuf, indicates that the Light %0a%3c descends from the pure forces (Partzufim) to the impure worlds of BYA, the %0a%3c impure forces referred to as death. And when Malchut joins with Bina and %0a%3c receives the strength from Bina to ascend and receive the Light, the other letters %0a%3c join Malchut, and she draws the Light of life from Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this state, the left leg of the Kuf is reduced in half, turning the Kuf into %0a%3c Tav, whose left leg is twice as thick, due to its shortening. The part of Malchut %0a%3c that passed Light to the impure forces now ascended out of them, hence there %0a%3c are two kinds of Malchut: Miftacha (key)— the part that joined with Bina, and %0a%3c Man'ula (lock)— the part that ascended out of the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c These two parts of Malchut manifest in different ways: Miftacha— openly and %0a%3c Man'ula— secretly. Two paths of bringing man to correction emerge from them: %0a%3c the good path of the Torah and the path of suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, after Malchut corrects her properties and joins with Bina, she no %0a%3c longer parts from Bina, but, upon receiving Light from her, Malchut pours it %0a%3c onto the worlds, and the impure forces lose their strength to sow death and rule %0a%3c over the world. And if a case arises where a sinner must be punished, the impure %0a%3c forces must first receive permission to punish him, for without permission they %0a%3c may not reveal the Man'ula. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, after Malchut joins with Bina, thereby correcting her properties, the %0a%3c impure forces are no longer free to rule the world, unless they are permitted. %0a%3c The reason for this is the letter Tet, the last letter of Bina, which sends the Light %0a%3c of life to all with the help of the Miftacha. After Malchut joins with Bina, she %0a%3c becomes a Miftacha, and does not let go of this connection. Respectively, the %0a%3c impure forces, the leg of the letter Kuf, can no longer sow death. %0a%3c %0a%3c Three places emerge from this: (i) where only the properties of the letter %0a%3c Tet rule by shining with the Light of life of this world; (ii) the entire world after %0a%3c Malchut joins with Bina, defined as Miftacha, when the letter Tet shines upon %0a%3c all, but permits the punishment of sinners according to the rule: "You advance %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 147 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c towards the goal either by the path of the Torah or by the path of suffering"; (iii) %0a%3c hell, the place of eternal punishment by the letter Kuf, in contrast with the first %0a%3c place, ruled by the letter Tet, where life is eternally prosperous. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the letters with all their secret properties, described by those who %0a%3c understand them, are located in the Temple. All the Upper and lower worlds %0a%3c are created and function in the framework of their laws-properties, and the %0a%3c Supernal Name, the Creator's name HaVaYaH rules over all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Mishkan (tabernacle) in the Temple was also designed with the help of %0a%3c letters, for its builder, Betzalel, knew how to join the letters that made Heaven %0a%3c and earth. And since he was unique in possessing this wisdom, he was entrusted %0a%3c with the building of the sanctuary. %0a%3c %0a%3c As the Creator chose Betzalel Above, so He wished him to be chosen below, %0a%3c as He said to Moshe Above: "Choose Betzalel." So Moshe said to his people %0a%3c below: "The Creator has chosen Betzalel." For such was Betzalel's name-property %0a%3c (Be Tzel El)— "In the Creator's shadow." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator is called ZA or the Sefira Tifferet in Partzuf ZA, which shines %0a%3c upon the Sefira Yesod, called Tzadik (righteous one). Betzalel is called Yesod, %0a%3c which receives the Light of VAK— an incomplete Light— from Tifferet, which is %0a%3c hence called "sitting in the shadow," and, in turn, shining into Malchut. Thus, %0a%3c like Tifferet, the Sefira Yesod that passes this Light also consists of six Sefirot: Hesed- %0a%3c Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. %0a%3c %0a%3c The name of the letter Tav, "truth," indicates that in order to reach its %0a%3c level, its degree, one must attain the property of truth. Therefore, the letter Tav %0a%3c claimed that with its properties man can fully analyze good and evil, renounce %0a%3c his impure desires as false, and to the degree that he renounces them, draw %0a%3c closer to the pure desires (forces), and thereby be certain that he will reach the %0a%3c goal of creation— correction of all his desires (Gmar Tikkun, end of correction). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ruly ask Him for help." For only with His help can one achieve correctior %0a%3c and spiritual elevation. However, this help only comes to those who genuinely, %0a%3c "truly" demand it. As soon as man is able to cry out wholeheartedly for the %0a%3c Creator's help, he instantly receives it. And if he does not receive an answer %0a%3c from the Creator— it is a sign that his request is not yet complete, that he did not %0a%3c yet fully realize his egoistic nature and properties as worthless, has not yet fully %0a%3c felt his helplessness and inability to exit and correct his properties by himself. %0a%3c This is why letter Tav was certain that once man acquires its property of truth, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 148 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered her that it is not worthy of becoming the basis %0a%3c of creation, for the forces of judgment that would arise from it would be so %0a%3c strong that even the complete righteous, who fulfilled the entire Torah from %0a%3c Aleph to Tav (A to Z) and reached the property of truth, will nevertheless be %0a%3c punished by it, for they have not destroyed all the sinners, as it is written in %0a%3c the Talmud (Shabbat, 55). %0a%3c %0a%3c Furthermore, the Creator declines its request, for it is also the seal of %0a%3c death, as its power brought death to this world. For man is bound to die, as the %0a%3c serpent forged its seal and deceived Adam in his understanding of the Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge. This is why the world cannot exist with its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER SHIN %0a%3c %0a%3c 24. The letter Shin appeared before the Creator and said: "Maker of the %0a%3c world, it befits the world to be created with me, for Your own name Shadday %0a%3c begins with me." The Creator replied: "You are fine, handsome, and truthful, %0a%3c but since the letters (properties) of the word Sheker (falsehood) took you to %0a%3c be with them, I cannot create the world with your properties, for SheKeR %0a%3c (falsehood) exists only because the letters Kuf and Reish took you." %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut consists of ten Sefirot and has two endings: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) If she has only her own properties, she contains all ten Sefirot, from %0a%3c Keter de Malchut to Malchut de Malchut. In this case she firmly restricts %0a%3c the diffusion of Light and is designated by the letter Tav; %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) If Ima-Bina of the world of At^ilut fills Malchut with her Light, Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut ends not in the Sefira Malchut, but in the Sefira Yesod, and is %0a%3c designated by the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The three tips of the letter Shin are called its crown and signify the Light of %0a%3c Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), which descends from Partzuf Ima-Bina %0a%3c into Partzuf Malchut. This Light of Bina, Ohr Hassadim (the Light of Mercy), %0a%3c creates new altruistic properties in Malchut, altruistic intentions to receive the %0a%3c Light for the Creator's sake, after which Partzuf Malchut can receive the Ohr %0a%3c Hochma (Light of Wisdom) from ZA (Talmud, Sanhedrin, 22). When bonded %0a%3c so, ZA and Malchut are called "husband and wife," and the Light that Malchut %0a%3c receives from ZA is called 'TOO blessings." %0a%3c %0a%3c This new ending of Part^u/Malchut in the Sefira Yesod instead of in the Sefira %0a%3c Malchut is therefore called Yesod de Nukva or "the central point of existence," %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 149 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for all that exists in the world originates from it and exists thanks to it. Partzuf %0a%3c Malchut is the sum of all the creatures, and we are all its parts. All the worlds %0a%3c and all that inhabit them constitute various parts of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Each Upper Partzuf is considered the Creator of its adjacent lower Partzuf, %0a%3c for the latter originates (born) from it. Therefore, in relation to all the crea- %0a%3c tures, Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilut is considered and called "the Creator," %0a%3c our Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c And, like the Tav, the letter Shin is called "truth" and "the Creator's seal," %0a%3c for a seal signifies the end of a spiritual object— Partzuf, like a seal fixed at the %0a%3c end of a letter, written in the name of the Creator. The Creator's seal is similar %0a%3c to Himself; this is why the seal is called the mark of truth, for only the pres- %0a%3c ence of a seal gives a letter the force of truth, and confirms the truthfulness %0a%3c of its content. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the significance of the letter Shin is greater than that of the letter %0a%3c Tav, for Shin is the first letter of the word Shadday, one of the Creator's names- %0a%3c properties, designating His power, by which He said "Dai" (enough) to creation- %0a%3c stop and do not descend further (Talmud, Hagigah, 12)— do not descend below %0a%3c the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c This reveals that the world and its inhabitants can only exist with the help %0a%3c of the letter Shin, thanks to its property that restricts the diffusion of Light. %0a%3c The Creator said: "Stop, Creature, at the letter Shin, and do not spread to the %0a%3c letter Tav," for if the Light had spread to Tav, the impure forces would have %0a%3c received such great strength that man would have no hope of escaping them and %0a%3c reaching altruistic properties. This is why the ending point of Shin is called "the %0a%3c central point of existence." %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, after the letter Shin saw the Creator refuse the letter Tav, precisely %0a%3c because ending the diffusion of Light with Tav creates conditions for correction %0a%3c of the world that are too difficult for man to meet, the letter Shin claimed that %0a%3c its property of Shadday is suitable for the creation of the world, and was certain %0a%3c that the Creator would choose it— its properties— as the basis of creation, for %0a%3c it possesses all the advantages that Tav lacked, which was the reason for the %0a%3c Creator's refusal. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it has Tav 's advantage, as well: it is the Creator's seal— truth. Moreover, %0a%3c it has an additional advantage: it is called by the name Shadday, the new ending %0a%3c of Malchut for the inhabitants of the world, instead of the ending by the property %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 150 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the letter Tav. Based on all that, the letter Shin found the strength and courage %0a%3c to appear before the Creator with the proposition to create the world with it. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered that precisely because of Shin's additional %0a%3c advantages compared to those of the letter Tav, the impure forces opposite it %0a%3c are strengthened. For opposite each letter (spiritually pure forces or properties) %0a%3c there is an opposing impure force (egoistic desire), as it is written: "The Creator %0a%3c had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%3c %0a%3c The strengthening of the impure forces from the properties of the letter Shin %0a%3c occurred as a result of her properties joining the impure properties of falsehood, %0a%3c forging spiritual purity of the letters Kuf and Reish: falsehood would be unable %0a%3c to exist in the world, for it would be recognized at once, had the letters Kuf and %0a%3c Reish not put Shin at the head of the word SheKeR (falsehood). And when truth %0a%3c stands at the head of the word that designates the property of falsehood, man %0a%3c naturally tends to err. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sources of impure forces: the first is a small luminescence %0a%3c (Ner Dakik), which the pure force itself (the Creator) sends to the impure forces %0a%3c (desires) so as to sustain them. This is done so they would not disappear until %0a%3c there is a need to "punish" the sinners with them. However, these are small %0a%3c forces— their height is not great, for they receive only a small luminescence, %0a%3c sufficient to sustain their life. %0a%3c %0a%3c This small luminescence descends into the impure forces from the letter %0a%3c Kuf, which results in these impure forces becoming similar to man in the %0a%3c worlds BYA, as a monkey in comparison to a human being, as it is said: "The %0a%3c Creator had made one opposite the other" (Kohelet, 7:14). %0a%3c %0a%3c The second source of impure forces arises from the lower ones' spiritual fall: %0a%3c as a result of people's evil, egoistic actions, the Light passes from the system of %0a%3c the pure forces into the impure. And the first transgression is Adam's sin, by %0a%3c which the system of the impure forces assumed an identical formation to that of %0a%3c the pure system, stationing itself opposite, parallel to it. As a result, the impure %0a%3c worlds ABYA emerged opposite the pure ones. %0a%3c %0a%3c The second source of impure forces is the letter Reish, which indicates that %0a%3c the impure forces rise and attach themselves to the pure forces, right up to the %0a%3c level of Bina of Malchut, designated by the letter Dalet. %0a%3c %0a%3c As was previously stated, the twenty-two letters of Partzuf Malchut of the %0a%3c world of Atzilut are divided in three groups of letters: units in Bina, tens in ZA, %0a%3c and hundreds in Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 151 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PARTZUF %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SEFIROT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c LETTERS %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BIN A (IMA) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph-Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c MALCHUT %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod-Tzadik %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Kuf-Tav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Alepk-Bet-Gimel correspond to Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina, called %0a%3c "the head" of a spiritual object (Partzuf). The letters from Dalet to Tet refer to the %0a%3c body of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Keter %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c HEAD %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Gimel %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Dalet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hesed %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Hey %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Gevura %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Vav %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Tifferet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c BODY %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Netzah %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Hod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Tet %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ■ Yesod %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The body only receives what descends to it from the head. Therefore, Dalet, %0a%3c the first letter of the body, through which the body receives Light from the head, %0a%3c is called Dalah ve Aniyah (poor and destitute). Dalet only receives what Gimel gives %0a%3c it. Since Gimel contains the Light of Hassadim, that is, what descends into Dalet. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is why the letter Gimel is called Gomel Hassadim (merciful One) %0a%3c (Talmud, Shabbat, 104), according to its action with regard to Dalet, which would %0a%3c otherwise be completely without Light. The protruding sharp angle on the right %0a%3c side of Dalet is the sign of Dalet's abundance of Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 152 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, opposite the pure (altruistic) Malchut, stands the impure Malchut, %0a%3c who is pride and does not wish to receive the Light from Gimel and rely on it. %0a%3c Instead, she rises up in the desire to be the head, and in so creates the sharp %0a%3c angle of the Dalet. That indicates that the presence of Ohr Hassadim disappears, %0a%3c transforming it into the letter Reish, which is written as it is pronounced— with %0a%3c two letters: Reish and Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The true merging of the pure ZA and Malchut is called ECHaD (one), %0a%3c consists of the letters Aleph, Chet and Dalet, for the letters from Aleph to Chet %0a%3c are the nine Sefirot of ZA. He passes the Light from Gimel of Bina to Gimel of %0a%3c Malchut, resulting in Malchut being filled with the Light of Hassadim, thereby %0a%3c becoming Dalet with a protruding right angle. As a result of this, ZA and %0a%3c Malchut become one. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the lower ones (people) sin in their actions (intentions), they give %0a%3c the impure Malchut the strength to cling to the pure one— Dalet, to erase the %0a%3c sharp angle of the Light of Hassadim and turn it into the letter Reish. Thus, %0a%3c the word Echad (one) becomes Acher (other, alien, foreign): Ale£>h-Chet-Dalet of %0a%3c the word Echad are transformed into Aleph-Chet-Reish of the word Acher, for %0a%3c instead of the connection with the Creator emerges a connection with other, %0a%3c impure forces, called "Elokim Acherim" (other gods), which cling to ZA and %0a%3c Malchut of the pure world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c This leads to the letters Kuf and Reish distorting the Creator's seal (Shin), %0a%3c the letter of truth. As a result, Yesod of Malchut, which receives from Yesod de ZA, %0a%3c becomes linked to the impure source instead of the pure, for a new Yesod of the %0a%3c impure Malchut was formed with the help of the letter Shin. %0a%3c %0a%3c From here the impure forces develop up to ten Sefirot with a head and a %0a%3c body, whereas Shin becomes the source of all that desolates, for destruction of %0a%3c purity begets impurity. And from this emerged the system of the impure worlds %0a%3c ABYA of the impure man. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we have learned how the letters Kuf and Reish became the two %0a%3c sources of emergence and development of impure forces. And since the impure %0a%3c forces pose as pure, they are called false, counterfeit letters whose purpose is to %0a%3c annihilate the system of the pure forces and their unity with the Creator, so as %0a%3c to forge themselves out of the devastation of the pure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The birth of the impure forces from the destruction of the pure ones %0a%3c is possible on account of the letter Shin, Yesod of Malchut, joining with the %0a%3c impure forces as a result of the forging of the letter Reish out of Dalet. Thereby, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 153 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Echad turns into Acher, and the system of the impure forces (Elokim Acherim, %0a%3c other gods) is created. %0a%3c %0a%3c And had the letters Kuf and Reish not captured the letter Shin, such an %0a%3c enormous system of impure forces, so capable of lying and falsifying everything %0a%3c in the eyes of man, would not have come into being. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the Creator answered the letter Shin: "Though you are good, you %0a%3c will stand at the head of the word Sheker (falsehood) together with the letters %0a%3c Kuf and Reish. Indeed, upon capturing you, with your power they will be able %0a%3c to create an entire system of impure forces of falsehood and forgery. Hence, I %0a%3c cannot create the world with your properties, for since there is an impure system %0a%3c opposite from you, it is impossible to achieve the goal of creation with you." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS KUF AND REISH %0a%3c %0a%3c 25. From the aforesaid, it follows that whoever wishes to tell a lie will succeed %0a%3c if he first tells the truth as a base on which the lie will then grow and start %0a%3c to act. And this is because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, in which the %0a%3c Patriarchs had been united, for the three lines in the writing of the letter %0a%3c Shin (w) signify the three Patriarchs, who designate the Sefirot-properties %0a%3c Hesed-Qevura-Tifferet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letters Kuf and Reish indicate the evil side, as they form the impure %0a%3c side, called KaR (cold), which lacks warmth and life, for it draws its sustenance %0a%3c from Malchut when she turns from living water into ice. However, to create an %0a%3c opportunity to exist, these letters attach the Shin to themselves, thus creating the %0a%3c combination KeSHeR (tie, knot), which embodies strength and survival. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the Light of Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet of Bina, which she receives from Yesod %0a%3c de ZA, creates a new ending in Malchut, a new Kli-desire to receive the Light %0a%3c called "100 blessings" from ZA. And since Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet are called the %0a%3c Patriarchs, and the Light that passes to Malchut descends from them, the letter %0a%3c Shin that designates them is called "truth." %0a%3c %0a%3c By eliminating the sharp angle of the letter Dalet, the impure forces turn it %0a%3c into the letter Reish. By this, they convert the word ECHaD into ACHeR, thereby %0a%3c stealing Yesod of the pure Malchut, designated by Shin. Also, with the letter Shin %0a%3c they build the Yesod of the impure Malchut, which leads to a very strong clinging %0a%3c of impure forces to pure ones. This clinging is called KeSHeR, the reciprocal tie %0a%3c joining pure and impure forces, a knot that is not easily severed. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 154 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c From the aforesaid, we see that the reason for the letters wishing for the world %0a%3c to be created with them is that each of them believes that only its properties can %0a%3c correct the world. The letter Shin thinks that the Light of Hassadim will bring the %0a%3c souls to the goal of creation. However, the letters Kuf and Reish—KaR (cold)— do %0a%3c not desire this Light, for receiving the Light of Mercy for the sake of bestowal is %0a%3c pure, but receiving it for the sake of pleasure is impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TZADIK %0a%3c %0a%3c 26. Subsequently, the letter Tzadik appeared before the Creator and said: %0a%3c "Master of the world, You should create the world with me, for Tzadikim (the %0a%3c righteous) are marked by me. You, who is called a Tzadik (righteous one), are %0a%3c also recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. %0a%3c Therefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "Tzadik, you are truly righteous, but you must %0a%3c remain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world %0a%3c to be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse." The concealment %0a%3c of the letter Tzadik is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was %0a%3c then joined by the letter Yod from the Creator's Holy Name Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey %0a%3c (HaVaYaH), who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator %0a%3c and His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, %0a%3c thereby creating the letter Tzadik. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for the necessity of concealing the letter Tzadik, which makes it %0a%3c unsuitable for the creation of the world with it, is that when the Creator created %0a%3c Adam, i.e., ZA, He created him as two Part?u/im-objects— male and female, %0a%3c connected to each other back to back. This is why the letter Yod stands with its %0a%3c back to the back of the letter Nun, both facing opposite directions, just as the %0a%3c letter Tzadik is depicted: the face of Yod turned upwards, while the face of Nun %0a%3c is turned downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the Creator also said to Tzadik: "In the future I will revoke the %0a%3c relationship of back-to back, and will join them face-to-face. In another place shall %0a%3c you so rise as such, but not at the beginning of creation. For in the beginning of %0a%3c creation, you must be connected back-to-back by the letters Nun and Yod, for this %0a%3c form indicates that the Light in you is concealed. Therefore, the world cannot %0a%3c be created with you." The letter Tzadik then left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tzadik came to suggest that the world should be created with its properties, %0a%3c for when it saw that the Tav's request was turned down by the Creator due to %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 155 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c its heavy laws, and the letter Shin— due to the impure forces clinging to it— it %0a%3c thought that its properties could be suitable for the creation of the world. After %0a%3c all, it, too, contains the Creator's seal, and no impure forces cling to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why Tzadik said to the Creator that the righteous are sealed by %0a%3c its name as a mark of their union with Him, by circumcision and turning %0a%3c up of the place of contact (Zivug) with the Creator, which, thanks to these %0a%3c corrections, repels all the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator, called Bina, is also marked by Tzadik, for He is righteous %0a%3c like ZA, since the Upper Part of Bina of the world of Atzilut (Aba ve Ima— AVI) %0a%3c corresponds to the male and female parts, like ZA and Malchut. And AVI are %0a%3c forever joined so as to send down the Light of Mercy and thus sustain the %0a%3c existence of all that are below them. This is why Tzadik thought itself suitable %0a%3c for creating the world, for the world lives by the Light of Mercy, and can reach %0a%3c the goal with its help. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tzadik is called the Sefira Yesod of ZA. When Yesod joins with %0a%3c Malchut, it is defined as Tzadik (righteous), for the nine Sefirot of ZA are from Yod %0a%3c to Tzadik, and Kuf is the beginning of Malchut, which consists of four Sefirot— %0a%3c Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Malchut is joined with Yesod of ZA, Kuf is joined with Tzadik, and %0a%3c Yesod is called Tzadik (righteous). And to this the Creator replied to Tzadik that %0a%3c it is Tzadik in Yesod of ZA: "And you are Tzadik in Me, for AVI are forever joined %0a%3c so as to pour down the Light of Mercy and sustain the existence of the lower %0a%3c ones. And you are righteous, for Malchut is also connected to you, just as in the %0a%3c alphabet, Kuf follows Tzadik. Yet, in spite of all that, you do not merit for your %0a%3c properties to become the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yesod of ZA includes in itself Malchut in the form of the letter Kuf in the %0a%3c word TzadiK. And when Malchut is included in Yesod as Tzadik, it is designated %0a%3c by the letter Nun, for Nun is Gevura of ZA (Yod-Keter, Chaf-Hochma, Lamed-Bina, %0a%3c Mem-Hesed, Nun-Gevura). %0a%3c %0a%3c When ZA grows and becomes big, his Sefirot Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet become %0a%3c Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat. Thus, Gevura becomes Bina. And when ZA becomes %0a%3c small once again, Bina, too, returns to being Gevura (Nun). This fall is designated %0a%3c by Nun's head looking down. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tzadik consists of the letters Nun and Yod connected back-to-back. %0a%3c The letter Nun designates Malchut with the properties of the Sefira Yesod included in %0a%3c her; Yod designates the actual Yesod of ZA. Their connection— back-to-back, facing %0a%3c out in opposite directions— indicates that impure forces cling to their backs. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 156 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c They conceal their backs from strangers since there is a flaw in their backs— the %0a%3c desire to receive the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma). This flaw must be concealed %0a%3c so as to prevent the impure forces from clinging to their backs. Therefore, the %0a%3c letter Tzadik is unsuitable for the world to be created by its properties. Its very %0a%3c shape reveals an opportunity for the impure forces to cling to it; this is why Adam %0a%3c (created out of ZA and Malchut when they are joined as Tzadik) is also created %0a%3c consisting of two halves, male and female, joined at their backs. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if the letter Tzadik were to argue that in the big state, in the presence %0a%3c of Ohr Hochma, ZA and Malchut unite face-to-face, it would be told that such %0a%3c connection is impossible at their place, but only during their ascent to AVI. For %0a%3c if such a connection were possible in their own place, the impure forces would %0a%3c immediately cling to them. For this reason, the letter Tzadik is unworthy of %0a%3c becoming the basis of the universe. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER PEH %0a%3c %0a%3c 27. The letter Peh entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world with me, for the future liberation of the world is inscribed %0a%3c in me, as the word Pedut (liberation, redemption) begins with me. That is, %0a%3c liberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create %0a%3c the world with me." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered her: "Though you are fine, the word Peshah %0a%3c (transgression) begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent %0a%3c that strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding %0a%3c from others' eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the %0a%3c letter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it." And the Creator also said to the %0a%3c letter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, %0a%3c for within it is the property of Avon (crime, sin). And though Ayin tried to %0a%3c object, saying that its properties are contained in the word Anavah (humility), %0a%3c the Creator refused it nonetheless. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pedut (Liberation) begins with the letter Peh, meaning that the property %0a%3c of Peh is contained in future liberation. This is why the letter Peh claims that %0a%3c it is worthy of being the basis of the world. Indeed, both Galut (exile) and %0a%3c Ge'ula (redemption) depend on Malchut: when Malchut has no inner Light %0a%3c of Hochma, the people of Israel are exiled from the land of Israel. For in our %0a%3c world, the land of Israel corresponds to Malchut of the world of Atzilut, the %0a%3c spiritual land of Israel. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 157 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Just as in the spiritual world, ZA (Israel) distances from Malchut (the land %0a%3c of Israel), the people of Israel separate and leave their land in our world. And %0a%3c when the children of Israel correct their actions, they cause ZA (Israel) to fill his %0a%3c Malchut (the land of Israel) with Light, build her with his Light and unite with %0a%3c her face-to-face. As a result, the children of Israel of our world merit redemption %0a%3c and return to their land. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Light from ZA, which builds and fills Malchut, descends from Sefirot %0a%3c Net^ah and Hod in ZA. Hochma of Malchut clothes in Net^ah and Bina of Malchut %0a%3c clothes in Hod. The letters Ayin and Peh are Netzah and Hod in ZA. This is why %0a%3c Peh, the Sefira Hod in ZA, claimed that it was suitable to be the basis of the world, %0a%3c for the Light of Hochma that brings redemption to the entire world stems from %0a%3c Peh to Malchut. Thus, if the world achieved its property, it would undoubtedly %0a%3c reach the end of correction— complete redemption. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Peh thought that it was more suitable to become the basis of %0a%3c the world than Ayin because although Ohr Hochma enters Netzah-Ayin and Hod- %0a%3c Peh, and is mainly present in Netzah-Ayin, redemption depends on Hod-Peh, %0a%3c nonetheless. That is because initially, Bina liberates Malchut from her restrictions %0a%3c and thereby redeems her. %0a%3c %0a%3c By receiving from Bina her properties of mercy, Malchut merits redemption. %0a%3c This is fulfilled in the following way: Bina transcends her own properties and %0a%3c joins with Malchut, as a result of which, upon receiving the Light of Hassadim, %0a%3c Malchut can now receive the Light of Hochma. The restrictions imposed on the %0a%3c reception of Light mostly affect the left side, i.e., Hod-Peh in ZA. And that is why %0a%3c the letter Peh thought that since the Light of Bina enters it, and not Netzah-Ayin, %0a%3c it is better suited to become the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, all the individual corrections made during the 6,000 years of the %0a%3c world's existence until the end of correction are considered incomplete, for the %0a%3c Upper Light, which allows for the discovery and analysis of all the impure forces %0a%3c within oneself, is not present in its entirety. Therefore, the Light may not be %0a%3c received in the worlds of BYA, below Parsa, below the boundary that separates %0a%3c the world of At^ilut from the worlds of BYA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Parsa is Malchut that ascended to Bina in order to restrict the diffusion and %0a%3c reception of Light into those parts of her that are located below Bina. And as %0a%3c a consequence of Adam's attempt to nevertheless receive the Light under the %0a%3c Parsa, impurity slipped into Malchut, of which it is said that the serpent appeared %0a%3c before Chava (Eve) and brought impurity upon her (Talmud, Shahhat, 146). This %0a%3c impurity will only be corrected at the end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 158 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The thing is that the absence of the Upper Light in the force capable of %0a%3c discerning good from evil in all of Malchut's thickness gives rise to a flaw called %0a%3c "tears"— two tears that fall into a vast sea from the two eyes of Hochma and Bina %0a%3c that are concealed from all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The two eyes are Hochma and Bina, and the tears signify the flaw in them %0a%3c from the presence of the impure force that appeared in them as a result of %0a%3c Adam's sin. This led to the ruin of the two Temples. These tears in Malchut's %0a%3c eyes will only dry at the end of correction, when death disappears from the %0a%3c world and all the Light shines in Hochma and Bina (item 56). %0a%3c %0a%3c So the letter Peh was told that although it brings the world Pedut (redemption) %0a%3c with its Light, and although all redemptions pass only through it, this Light is %0a%3c incomplete. All the individual corrections are imperfect, for they come and go, %0a%3c just as the two Temples. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the properties of Peshah (transgression) and Pedut (redemption) in the %0a%3c letter Peh are not sufficiently perfect and complete so as to withstand the sin of %0a%3c Adam, for in the absence of the full Light of Hochma, there is clinging of impure %0a%3c forces. Hence, the letter Peh is unworthy of being the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since the property of Peshah (transgression) is concealed, the force of %0a%3c the serpent is present therein, deceiving people and leading them to their death. %0a%3c And it is impossible to kill it, just as a snake bites and immediately hides its head %0a%3c in itself (similar to the head of the letter Peh), which makes it impossible to kill %0a%3c it, for one may only kill the serpent within oneself by striking the "head." This %0a%3c is why the letter Peh is unsuitable for the creation of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER AYIN %0a%3c %0a%3c Bina of the world of Atzilut is called Ima Ilaa (Supernal Mother) and also Anavah %0a%3c (modesty, humility). (Here, the capital "A" designates the letter Ayin, not to be %0a%3c confused with Aleph). The Sefira Netzah of Zeir Anpin (designated by the letter %0a%3c Ayin) clothes into Malchut with all of its Light, and ascends to Bina, who adorns %0a%3c her with her own adornments: Bina clothes into Netzah of ZA. But since the %0a%3c letter Peh, signifying Peshah (transgression) is concealed in ~Netzah, the Creator %0a%3c refused to create the world with its properties, as it is written in item 27. %0a%3c %0a%3c Two words render the meaning of the word "transgression" in Hebrew: %0a%3c Peshah and Avon. However, "transgression" is mainly concentrated in the letter %0a%3c Peh, for Malchut of ZA connects into the Sefira Hod of ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 159 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of Adam's sin, Klipot (shells, impure forces) cling to Malchut of %0a%3c ZA. But Netrah of ZA is a property of ZA himself, and impure forces cannot %0a%3c cling to it. Yet, as it is written in the Talmud (Baba Kama), even Netrah is subject %0a%3c to Klipot clinging to it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This flaw— the ability of the impure forces to cling to Netrah of ZA— is called %0a%3c "transgression." However, the word Avon (not Peshah) indicates that Netrah is %0a%3c pure and direct, and that the transgression is caused by its connection with %0a%3c the Se/ira Hod. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason the Creator turns to the letters Peh and Ayin at the same time %0a%3c is that Netrah and Hod are like two body parts— two legs. This is why they both %0a%3c appeared before Him with their requests. However, The Zohar clarifies each of %0a%3c them (their properties) one at a time. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER SAMECH %0a%3c %0a%3c 28. The letter Samech appeared before the Creator and said: "Creator of the %0a%3c world, it would be good to create the world with my properties, for within %0a%3c me is Smicha (support) for the fallen, as it is written: 'The Creator supports %0a%3c (Somech) all who fall.'" The Creator replied: "That is why you are needed in %0a%3c your place; do not move from it. If you move from your place, contained in %0a%3c the word Somech, those who fall will lose your support, for they rely on you %0a%3c (your properties)." Having heard this, the letter Samech departed. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Samech stands for Se/ira Tifferet in ZA, i.e., Bina in the body of %0a%3c ZA. Since Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina (KHB) were transformed into Hesed-Gevura- %0a%3c Tifferet (HGT) in ZA, they were emptied of the Light of Hochma, and were left %0a%3c with only the Light of Hassadim, thus changing their name from KHB to HGT. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we know, Bina consists of two parts: the Upper Part, called GAR: Gimel %0a%3c (three) Rishonot (first ones)— the first three Sefirot KHB, and the lower part, called %0a%3c ZAT: Zayin (seven) Tachtonot (lower ones)— the seven lower Sefirot from Hesed to %0a%3c Malchut. The Upper Part of Bina is called Aba ve Ima (AVI). Being filled with the %0a%3c Light of Mercy, Aba ve Ima exist in a state of perfection— without any desire to %0a%3c receive, but only to bestow. %0a%3c %0a%3c AVI are designated by Samech (numerical value - 60), for they include the %0a%3c first three Sefirot KHB and three Sefirot of ZA, which, in view of the absence of %0a%3c Ohr Hochma in ZA, are not called KHB, but rather HGT. Therefore AVI consist %0a%3c of six Sefirot, each consisting of ten, totaling 60 = Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 160 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ZAT of Bina receive the Light from Above and pass it on to ZA. This part %0a%3c of Bina has the property of ZA, rather than of Bina, as it needs to receive exactly %0a%3c what ZA needs, and then pass it to him. Since, unlike Bina, who does not wish %0a%3c to receive anything, ZAT of Bina need to receive Ohr Hochma for ZA, they feels %0a%3c a lack for it, and thus separate from Bina and an independently existing object- %0a%3c Partzuf forms out of her lower part. %0a%3c %0a%3c This Partzuf is called YESHSUT, and it is designated by the letter Mem %0a%3c (numerical value - 40), for it consists of four Sefirot—Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod %0a%3c of Partzuf AVI. Owing to its shape (properties), the block-letter Mem is called %0a%3c Mem Stumah (closed). %0a%3c %0a%3c However, this separation of AVI into two parts occurs only when they have %0a%3c no Light of Hochma, but only the Light of Hassadim. Consequently, the Upper %0a%3c Part of Bina remains in its perfection, whereas the lower part feels a flaw in its %0a%3c state by not receiving Ohr Hochma. And since spiritual objects are separated by %0a%3c the differences in their properties, the sensation of imperfection separates the %0a%3c lower part of Bina from the Upper. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, if those below improve their "intentions" (called "actions" in %0a%3c the spiritual), and ask ZA for help in correcting their actions, overcoming the %0a%3c egoism of impure desires, and acquiring spiritually pure, altruistic desires, ZA %0a%3c then turns to the superior YESHSUT, which turns to AVI. AVI then send their %0a%3c request even higher, receive the Light of Hochma and pass it to YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Finally, YESHSUT and AVI unite into one Partzuf, for having received Ohr %0a%3c Hochma, YESHSUT becomes as perfect as AVI are perfect being filled with Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim. YESHSUT passes the Light of Hochma down to ZA, who then passes %0a%3c it to Malchut. The Light that Malchut receives from ZA is referred to as 100 %0a%3c blessings, for Samech = 60 joins with Mem = 40. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, when man sins in his intentions (desires, actions), he does not %0a%3c turn to Malchut with a request for help, causing the Light of Hochma to disappear %0a%3c from ZA, and ZA returns from Gadlut (big state) back to Katnut (small state). %0a%3c (When ZA contains the Light of Hochma, he is called "big"; and when he is filled %0a%3c with only the Light of Hassadim, he is called "small"). And the united Partzuf %0a%3c Bina is once more divided into AVI and YESHSUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this small state (Katnut), ZA and Malchut are in danger of impure forces %0a%3c (Klipot) clinging to them. To make certain this does not happen, for then they %0a%3c may fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa into the worlds BYA, AVI send %0a%3c them the property of Samech (the Light of Mercy). And although it is only the %0a%3c Light of Hassadim without the Light of Wisdom (Light of Hochma), it provides %0a%3c ZA and Malchut with the sensation of perfection in acts of bestowal, and thus %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 161 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c impure forces can no longer cling to them, for the sole intention of the impure %0a%3c forces is to receive the Light of Wisdom from a pure Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this is why the Light that fills ZA in Katnut is called Samech, which %0a%3c testifies to its action: Samech "supports" ZA and Malchut so that they wouldn't %0a%3c fall from the world of Atzilut below the Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the letter Samech thought that if the world were created with %0a%3c its properties, it would be able to reach the goal of creation and merge with %0a%3c the Creator. Its Light could shine in ZA and Malchut even in their small state, %0a%3c and the Klipa (impure force) would not attempt to snatch the Light from them. %0a%3c On the contrary, the impure, egoistic forces would flee from its Light. Samech %0a%3c believed that if the world were to be created with its properties, it would be able %0a%3c to protect all creatures, even when their actions were corrupted, for even in such %0a%3c a state, the impure force would not be able to harm them. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator said to Samech that precisely because its role is to support %0a%3c those who fall and to protect the lower ones in times of their spiritual descent, %0a%3c it must stay in its place and not move from it. For if the world were created by %0a%3c it, its power would always prevail over all, ridding ZA and Malchut of the chance %0a%3c to grow out of their small state. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if ZA and Malchut don't stimulate the lower ones (people) to raise %0a%3c MAN— request for help in achieving Gadlut, the Upper Light will not be able %0a%3c to descend to bring the creatures to the end of correction and redemption. %0a%3c Therefore, the letter Samech must support the lower ones until they merit more. %0a%3c But when they do merit, they will be able to receive the great Light called " 100 %0a%3c blessings" into their entire Partzuf. So the Creator refused to create the world %0a%3c with the letter Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c "Because the lower ones need Samech only in their Katnut, in the absence %0a%3c of the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), ZON need you and you can help them. %0a%3c However, they need you only in their Katnut. But you do not help to bring them %0a%3c to perfection, and so you cannot be the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER NUN %0a%3c %0a%3c 29. The letter Nun entered and said to the Creator: "It would be good for You %0a%3c to create the world with me, for Norah Tehilot (great praises) is written with %0a%3c me, as well as 'Praising of the righteous.'" %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator replied: "Return to your place, for you are the reason that %0a%3c the letter Samech returned to its place. And rely on it for support. For the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 162 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c letter Nun exists in the word Nefilah (fall), which must be corrected by the %0a%3c letter Samech. This is the reason why it needed to return to its place— so as to %0a%3c strengthen the lower ones." The letter Nun left Him at once. %0a%3c %0a%3c When Nun saw that the Creator sent the letter Samech away (as its properties %0a%3c are only used in the state of Katnut, that is, only to support those who had fallen %0a%3c from the Gadlut), it thought that it was worthy of being the basis of the world. %0a%3c This is because not only does Nun have all the advantages of Samech, but it can %0a%3c also use Ohr Hochma, the Light of Gadlut. Thus, the reason for the Creator's %0a%3c refusal to Samech does not apply to Nun. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Gevura in ZA is called Nun, for it is entirely mitigated by Bina's %0a%3c property of mercy, called Nun = 50 gates of Bina. It is this property of Gevura that %0a%3c gives ZA the name Norah Tehilot (great praises). lma-Bina is called Tehilah (praise), %0a%3c and since Gevura descends from Bina, it is referred to as Norah Tehilot, while Nun %0a%3c is used in the Sefira Yesod, in the Gadlut of ZA during his Zivug with Nukva. Like %0a%3c Ima, this is whence Nukva receives the name Tehilah, while ZA becomes one in %0a%3c both Tehilot— Ima and Nulcva. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, the letter Nun said that, being in Gevura, the left line of ZA, it %0a%3c attracts the Light of Mercy emanated by Samech (Bina, Ima), which is also called %0a%3c the "Upper Tehilah," as a result of which ZA acquires its properties and the name %0a%3c Norah Tehilot to match them. This is why Nun has all the properties of Samech: the %0a%3c Light of Mercy that bestows perfection and repels the impure forces-desires. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Nun added: "However, I have an additional advantage in that I am %0a%3c used during the big state of ZA in his Yesod, in the letter Tzadik, of which I am %0a%3c the left element." This Nun in the letter Tzadik is that same Nun that is defined as %0a%3c Norah Tehilot (praises of the righteous), for even when ZA achieves Gadlut during %0a%3c the ascent of ZON to AVI, Nun also acts in Yesod of ZA, connecting Nukva back- %0a%3c to-back with ZA, so that ZA receives the Light of Mercy from AVI (Samech). %0a%3c %0a%3c And so Nun is called "praises of the righteous," for Yod (righteous one, the %0a%3c basis of the world) mounts it. Nun is called "great praises," for it attracts the %0a%3c Light of Wisdom to Malchut in the state of Gadlut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, we find that Malchut receives all her beauty from Nun, which is %0a%3c located in Yesod of ZA. This is why the letter Nun claimed that it merits for the %0a%3c world to be created with its properties, for its luminescence adds to the Light of %0a%3c Wisdom that unites and revives ZON, and does not merely support them, like %0a%3c the letter Samech. %0a%3c %0a%3c So the Creator answered it: "You are wrong in thinking that you merit %0a%3c leading the world to complete correction by your properties, without the clinging %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 163 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of impure forces, for even your properties need to be supported by the letter %0a%3c Samech. Indeed, this is precisely why you are connected back-to-back with the %0a%3c letter Yod, and the Light of Samech guards you against the clinging of the impure %0a%3c forces onto you. And that is why your properties, which rely upon the strength %0a%3c of Samech, are merely ones of support. Hence, you are unworthy of becoming %0a%3c the basis of the world." %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS MEM AND LAMED %0a%3c %0a%3c 30. The letter Mem entered and said: "Master of the world, it would be good %0a%3c for You to create the world by me, for MelecH (King) is called by me." The %0a%3c Creator replied: "That is so, but I shall not create the world by you, for the %0a%3c world needs a King. Return to your place. Also, I shall not create the world %0a%3c with the letters Lamed and Chaf that form the word MeLeCH (King), as the %0a%3c world cannot exist without a King." %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Mem is the Se/ira Hesed in ZA, which receives the Light from its %0a%3c corresponding Se/ira Hesed in Bina. When, in addition to the Light of Mercy %0a%3c in his small state, ZA receives the Light of Wisdom and becomes big, his Sefirot %0a%3c HGT turn into Sefirot Hochma-Bina-Daat (HBD). In other words, Hesed in ZA %0a%3c ascends and becomes Hochma, thereby revealing a new Light, the Light of %0a%3c Hochma, the Light of the Creator's face. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the letter Mem claimed that it was suitable for the world to be %0a%3c created by it, for it reveals the Creator's Light to the world, thereby eliminat- %0a%3c ing any risk of impure forces clinging to it, and so the world is guaranteed %0a%3c complete correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the Creator answered that it is forbidden to reveal this Light to the %0a%3c world, for the world needs for this great Light to first clothe itself in the three %0a%3c letters of the word MeLeCH. In other words, the great Light may be revealed in %0a%3c the world only if Mem joins with the letters Lamed and Chaf. So the Creator said, %0a%3c "Go and join with them." %0a%3c %0a%3c Mem in the word Meleck is Hesed. Lamed is Bina, which passes the Light %0a%3c to ZA. The letter Chaf is Malchut, Nukva of ZA, for there cannot be a Meleck %0a%3c (King) without Malchut (Kingdom). Also, all of the Light becomes revealed only %0a%3c thanks to Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this case, Malchut shines from ZA in three places: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1) Malckut becomes a Kisseh (throne) for a King (ZA). A Kisseh derives from %0a%3c Kissui (cover, concealment), so it is designated by the bent letter Chaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 164 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 2) Malchut clothes ZA. Because the great Light is revealed only to Israel, %0a%3c Malchut clothes ZA, and when her kingdom is revealed, ZA frees %0a%3c himself from her garment and throws it over all the nations of the %0a%3c world, idolaters, and the Light of his face pours upon Israel. And all %0a%3c the righteous then point their finger at the Creator and say: "This is %0a%3c the Creator, to whom I aspired!" This diffusion of Light is designated %0a%3c by the letter Chaf. %0a%3c %0a%3c 3) Malchut becomes a crown on the head of ZA. And this is the property %0a%3c of the letter Chaf, of Keter (crown of ZA). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER CHAF %0a%3c %0a%3c 31. At this time the letter Chaf descended from the Kisseh - the Creator's %0a%3c throne, and stood before the Creator. It trembled and said to Him: "Creator %0a%3c of the world, with my properties I merit to become the basis of the world, for I %0a%3c am Kavod - Your Glory." When the letter Chaf descended from the Creator's %0a%3c throne, all the worlds trembled, and the throne itself, verging on collapse. %0a%3c The Creator then answered: "Chaf, what are you doing here? I will not create %0a%3c the world by you. Return to your place, for you exist in the word Kelayah %0a%3c (destruction) and in the word Kalah (bride)." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator's throne is the world of Beria. The appearance of the letter %0a%3c Mem before the Creator led to the letter Chaf falling from His throne. As a %0a%3c result, Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria trembled, as well as all the lower %0a%3c worlds with all their inhabitants. %0a%3c %0a%3c All the arguments that the letters raised in their wish for the world to be %0a%3c created with each of them is like raising MAN— a request for precise measure of %0a%3c help from Above in the form of Upper Light (called MAD), corresponding to %0a%3c that particular letter. %0a%3c %0a%3c If so, ZON will rule the world, and this ruling is effected by the very Light %0a%3c descending from ZON in the exact quantity of MAD that each letter evoked %0a%3c and caused, for the MAD precisely corresponds to the MAN in both quantity %0a%3c and quality, whereas MAN is the actual property of the letter. Hence, each letter %0a%3c argues that it can draw the kind of Light from Above that will surely bring all %0a%3c creatures to the goal. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the Creator's answers to each of the twenty-two letters of ZON de %0a%3c Atzilut constitute the descending MAD (the Upper Light, strength, help) that %0a%3c precisely corresponds to the MAN raised by that particular letter. And when the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 165 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Upper Light that descends from a particular letter begins to rule the world, this %0a%3c signifies the Creator's reply to that letter. Since the impure forces cling to one of %0a%3c the letter's properties, as the Creator created two precisely balanced, opposing %0a%3c systems of pure and impure forces, this reveals the letter's inability to rule the %0a%3c world. And thus, the Creator dismissed each letter's individual claim to build %0a%3c the world by its property in order to bring it to the goal of creation. %0a%3c %0a%3c Herein lies the Creator's "game" with each of the twenty-two letters, giving %0a%3c each the opportunity to reveal its properties, power and forces, until it becomes %0a%3c clear from their aspirations and analysis, which of them truly merits the world %0a%3c being governed by it. %0a%3c %0a%3c From this we see that when the letter Mem began to reveal its great Light in %0a%3c the world, in doing so, it caused the fall of the Kisse (throne). This is so because %0a%3c the Kisse has two properties: (i) it covers and conceals the Creator, where the %0a%3c word Kisse derives from the word Kissui; (ii) it reveals the Creator's greatness in %0a%3c the worlds with the help of the three letters MeLeCH. Then, Malchut that became %0a%3c a Kissui, the Creator's cover, ascends and turns to Chaf— the Creator's own gar- %0a%3c ments—thus revealing the King (Creator), and it becomes a crown on His head. %0a%3c %0a%3c But as soon as the letter Mem, which was not clothed in Chaf, began to reveal %0a%3c the Light of the Creator's face, the letter Chaf fell from the Kisse (the throne of %0a%3c His Glory), stopped concealing Him, and stated that from now on only the %0a%3c Creator's revealed glory would rule over it, without any kind of concealment, as %0a%3c desired by Mem. %0a%3c %0a%3c Owing to Chaf s fall from the throne, two hundred thousand worlds that origi- %0a%3c nate from Hochma and Bina of the world of Beria, as well as the worlds below them, %0a%3c shook and trembled on the verge of collapse. For the entire connection between %0a%3c the lower degree or Partzuf and the one above it lies in the fact that Malchut of the %0a%3c Upper Degree becomes Keter of the lower. And the property of the letter Chaf con- %0a%3c sists in clothing Malchut of an Upper spiritual object in Keter of a lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are three distinctive features to the throne: (i) six steps leading to the %0a%3c throne, six Sefirot-Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod of the lower one; (ii) four %0a%3c legs of the throne, the Light in Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina-Daat of the lower one; %0a%3c (iii) Malchut of the Upper One that descends to the lower one, clothes into it, %0a%3c and all the Light from the Upper One is passed through her to the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, when Chaf fell from the throne of the Creator's glory, the connection %0a%3c between the world of Atzilut and the throne (world of Beria) was severed. This %0a%3c is so because Chaf (Malchut of the world of Atzilut) that clothes in Sefirot Keter- %0a%3c Hochma-Bina-Daat of the world of Beria pours all the Light onto the world of %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 166 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Beria, called the throne of His glory. But when Chaf fell from the throne, the %0a%3c connection between the world of Atzilut and the world of Beria was severed, %0a%3c Chaf trembled, for it lost the power to bestow upon the world of Beria, and two %0a%3c hundred thousand worlds (Hochma and Bina out of Sefirot Keter-Hochma-Bina- %0a%3c Daat of the world of Beria) trembled in fear of collapsing, for they lost all of their %0a%3c life-force, which they receive from the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, in the world of Atzilut, Bina of the world of Atzilut, the Creator, is %0a%3c connected with ZON. This is because Partzuf Bina of the world of Atzilut consists %0a%3c of ten Sefirot, and her last Sefira, Malchut, clothes in ZA of the world of Atzilut %0a%3c with the property of the letter Chaf. Malchut of the Sefira Bina, which clothes in %0a%3c ZA, is the letter Chaf. And this letter Chaf is the Creator's throne in ZA. For the %0a%3c Creator is Bina, Sefira above ZA. And ZA becomes a throne for Bina. And during %0a%3c the fall, the connection between Bina and ZA is severed, since Chaf is Malchut of %0a%3c Bina; it clothes into ZA and passes all the Light to him. %0a%3c %0a%3c And it therefore trembled (lost its ability to bestow upon ZA), and so did %0a%3c two hundred thousand worlds, which are the Light for ZA, called Hochma and %0a%3c Bina or KHBD— the four legs of the throne— for all the Light departed from %0a%3c them. And the worlds trembled in fear of collapsing, that is, Sefirot Hesed-Gevura- %0a%3c Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod in ZA that include all the worlds below them, for all the %0a%3c Light of Bina departed thence. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator told the letter Chaf that because it fell from the throne of His %0a%3c glory, the first three Sefirot of ZA trembled, and all the other worlds are on the %0a%3c verge of total collapse and destruction without any hope of restoration; hence, %0a%3c Chaf must return to its place in the throne of glory. %0a%3c %0a%3c Chaf's return to its place in the Creator's throne takes place just as He %0a%3c refuses to create the world with the letter Mem, for the world needs a King. That %0a%3c is, the trembling of the letter Chaf as it fell from the Creator's throne, which %0a%3c in turn, made the worlds tremble in fear of possible collapse, and the Creator's %0a%3c answer to the letter Mem transpire simultaneously. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER YOD %0a%3c %0a%3c 32. The letter Yod entered and said: "Maker of the world! It would be good %0a%3c to create the world by me, for Your Holy name begins with me." The Creator %0a%3c replied: "It is sufficient that you are inscribed in My Name, in Me, and all of %0a%3c your aspirations are to Me, and you should not be uprooted from it all." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 167 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Since Yod is the first letter of the Creator's name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav- %0a%3c Hey), the beginning of the Creator's revelation to creatures, the first degree %0a%3c of the Upper Light, the letter Yod argued for the world to be created with %0a%3c its properties, for the world would then be absolutely guaranteed complete %0a%3c correction. However, the Creator objects to it. As was already stated, the letters' %0a%3c questions and the Creator's answers signify the Creator playing with each letter, %0a%3c where the letters' questions are their MAN, and the Creator's answers are MAD %0a%3c in the form of the Upper Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c So, by telling Yod, "It is sufficient," the Creator thus explained the creation of %0a%3c restriction— that the Light is only allowed to descend to its level, but no further. %0a%3c And this restriction is fixed in the Creator's name Shadday (Shin-Dalet-Yod). After %0a%3c Yod began to spread with the great Light, the Creator stopped it, forbidding it %0a%3c to spread to the letter Tav, but only to Shin (as was said above, in item 25). He %0a%3c said to it: "Enough, and do not spread further. Otherwise you will not be able %0a%3c to remain forever in My Name HaVaYaH." %0a%3c %0a%3c As the sages said: "My Name is not pronounced as it is written. For it is %0a%3c written HaVaYaH, but pronounced Adonay" (Talmud, Pesahim, 50). Indeed, %0a%3c the name HaVaYaH is not subject to change, as it is written: "For I, the Lord %0a%3c (HaVaYaH), do not change" (Malachi, 3:6). For corruption and its correction %0a%3c emerge in the days of the world's existence, meaning that constant changes are %0a%3c coming. Therefore, until the end of correction, the Creator is called Adonay, for %0a%3c this name is subject to change, and not HaVaYaH, which can never be altered. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, in the future, after the end of correction, HaVaYaH will be pronounced %0a%3c as it is written. Therefore, the Creator said, "If I see some fault or evil in you, %0a%3c by this you will be removed from My Name, for My Name, HaVaYaH, may not %0a%3c contain anything flawed or corrected— neither corruption nor correction. And %0a%3c this is why the world cannot be created by your properties." There are three %0a%3c degrees in the letter Yod of the name HaVaYaH: in the Sefira Hochma of ZA, in %0a%3c Hochma of AVI, and in Hochma of Arich Anpin, called "concealed wisdom." %0a%3c %0a%3c HaVaYaH begins with a dot, which then turns into Yod. Subsequently, Yod %0a%3c (Ohr Hochma) spreads to the sides and downward and turns into the letter Dalet, %0a%3c which consists of a horizontal roof-like line that indicates the property of Bina- %0a%3c Ima (mercy, Hassadim, width). When Ohr Hassadim stops spreading in width, %0a%3c Ohr Hochma begins to spread downward in the form of a vertical line. This is the %0a%3c leg of the letter Dalet, the property of Hochma-Aba. %0a%3c %0a%3c The common property of AVI is designated by the letter Dalet. AVI beget %0a%3c ZA, designated by the letter Vav inside the Dalet, and eventually forms the shape %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 168 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c of the letter Hey. Thus, the request of ZA (Vav) to receive from AVI compels %0a%3c them to unite their properties of Hochma (vertical line) and Hassadim (horizontal %0a%3c line), with the help of the letter Yod. Consequently, AVI receive the Light from %0a%3c Yod and pass it on to ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c The screen with the desires of Malchut is called "a point," since the collision %0a%3c between the screen and the coming Light yields Returning Light. And since the %0a%3c received Light always consists of ten Lights, the screen is called "ten points." %0a%3c %0a%3c Yod designates the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf Keter, from the Light %0a%3c of Hochma downwards, while Vav signifies the spreading of Nekudot inside Partzuf %0a%3c Hochma. However, there is no sign in HaVaYaH that indicates the diffusion of %0a%3c Light in Keter. %0a%3c %0a%3c Entrance or exit of the letter Yod in a word signifies either presence or %0a%3c absence of the Light of Hochma. There are four kinds of correction: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The First Ibur— conception of the small state of ZON. This is an %0a%3c absolutely passive spiritual state, where the letter Yod enters the %0a%3c word Ohr (Light) and transforms it into Avir (air), becoming the %0a%3c VAK of the Partzuf. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. The letter Yod exits the word Avir, which converts it back to Ohr: the %0a%3c Light of Hochma enters VAK of Partzuf; %0a%3c %0a%3c 3. The Second Ibur— conception of the Gadlut state of ZON: AHP of %0a%3c Bina ascend from ZON to Bina, and GE de ZON ascend with them, %0a%3c for they were together in the Katnut state, defined as conception of %0a%3c GE de ZON; %0a%3c %0a%3c 4. The diffusion of the Light of Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER TET %0a%3c %0a%3c 33. The letter Tet entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world with me, for it is by me that You are called Tov (Good)." %0a%3c The Creator replied: "I will not create the world by you, for your goodness is %0a%3c concealed within you and is invisible. Therefore, it cannot take any part in %0a%3c the world that I wish to create, and will only be revealed in the world to come. %0a%3c And since your goodness is concealed within you, the gates of the palace will %0a%3c sink into the ground, for the letter Chet is opposite from you, and when you %0a%3c join together, the word CHeT (sin) will be formed. This is why these two %0a%3c letters are not recorded in the names of the holy tribes." The letter Chet %0a%3c immediately moved aside. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 169 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Tet, whose numeric value of nine, is the inner property of the %0a%3c Sefira Yesod in ZA, while the outer property of Yesod in ZA is the letter Tzadik, %0a%3c whose numeric value of ninety, and it joins with Nukva de ZA, forming the %0a%3c notion of Tzadik (righteous one). Besides being the inner property of Yesod in %0a%3c ZA, Tet is also the ninth letter among the letters of Bina in ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c Also, Tet is called Tov (good). And since Tov is called Tzadik, for it is the %0a%3c inner Light of Yesod, called Tzadik, to whom no impure forces could cling, Tet %0a%3c calls on the above to justify its claim to become the basis of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the Talmud (Hagiga, 12), the sages wrote: "In the Light by which the %0a%3c Creator created the world, Adam saw from one end of the world to the other. %0a%3c But the Creator saw that the deeds of the generations of the Flood and the %0a%3c builders of the Tower of Babel are detrimental, and concealed that Light for the %0a%3c righteous in the future." Because the Creator saw that their actions will bring %0a%3c the threat of the clinging of the impure forces, He concealed this Light, Thus, %0a%3c the Light descended secretly from the Supernal Righteous (AVI) to the righteous %0a%3c one (Yesod in ZA), the letter Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c And so the Creator told Tet that because He must conceal it from the sinners %0a%3c and only the righteous will be worthy of it in the world to come, it cannot %0a%3c partake in the creation and correction of the world, for the world is ZON, and %0a%3c the letter Tet is constantly in danger of being clung to by impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since this Light shines only secretly inside Yesod of ZA, and not %0a%3c openly, Nukva will not be able to receive this Light directly, but only through %0a%3c its concealment in her. Therefore, the gates of Nukva sink into her Sefira Yesod, %0a%3c which safeguards them against the clinging of the impure forces, and they are %0a%3c confident that the impure forces will not be able to rule over her gates. For even %0a%3c at the time of the ruin of the Temple, the impure forces could not rule over the %0a%3c gates of the Temple, and sank into the ground, that is, the ground consumed %0a%3c them. "But because you are in need of such protection, I cannot create the world %0a%3c with you," the Creator answered Tet. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two pipes (channels) in Yesod de ZA in the world of Atzilut: the %0a%3c right one serves for the birth of the souls, and the left one for throwing away %0a%3c waste to the impure forces. The letter Chet is Hod, whose property is Malchut %0a%3c in ZA, the left pipe in Yesod of ZA, for the properties of the letter Chet are the %0a%3c properties of Ku/ included in Yesod, whereas Ku/ emanates Ner Dakik (tiny Light) %0a%3c to the impure forces, from which they receive the strength to be similar to an %0a%3c image of a pure man, as a monkey compared to a man, for the Creator created %0a%3c purity parallel to impurity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 170 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c These two pipes are located very close to each other, separated only by a thin %0a%3c partition, called "a garlic husk." Consequently, the left pipe has the strength to %0a%3c rule over the right one, thereby forming CHeT (numerical value 8 + 9 = 17). %0a%3c %0a%3c The numerical value of CHeT (17) equals that of the word TOV (9 + 6 + %0a%3c 2 = 17), which means that the impure force opposes the pure one. And if the %0a%3c right pipe (the letter Tet) prevails, the word CHeT (sin) will turn into TOV %0a%3c (good, goodness). %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the left pipe (CHeT) has the strength to rule over the right one (Tet), %0a%3c the impure forces can suck the Upper Light for themselves. This would give %0a%3c power to the sinners of the world. This is why neither diet nor Tet are present in %0a%3c the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, to show that they (the tribes) are above %0a%3c the letter Chet, the root of all the opposing impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c When all the letters merited receiving a blessing through the letter Bet, they %0a%3c lined up in their alphabetical order, in which the letters Tet and Reish joined. %0a%3c The letter Tet ascended, but did not take its place until the Creator asked her: %0a%3c "Tet, why did you ascend, but do not take your place?" It replied: "You created %0a%3c me to begin the words Tov (goodness) and Torah, as it is written: 'And the %0a%3c Creator saw that the Light was good.' How then can I join and stand beside the %0a%3c letter Reish, when it begins the word Rah (evil)?" %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator answered: "Return to your place, for it is precisely you that %0a%3c needs the letter Reish. For man, whom I intend to create, combines all those %0a%3c properties— you as the right property, and Reish as the left." After that, both Tet %0a%3c and Reish returned to their places. %0a%3c %0a%3c Three lines emerge in ZA of the world of Atzilut. However, they emerge from %0a%3c their source, Bina. (As a result of the second restriction, Malchut ascends to Bina, %0a%3c which leads to Sefirot Bina-ZA-Malchut falling into a lower Partzuf, into ZA.) Bina %0a%3c is called Eloh-im (Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yod-Mem), and as a result of second restriction, %0a%3c her part Ale£>h-Lame%3ci-He)i (the ELEH of the word Eloh-im, AHP) fell into a lower %0a%3c Partzuf, to ZA. Only the letters Yod-Mem (the IM of Eloh-im) remained in Bina. %0a%3c This means that only half, ( VAK, GE) remained in her from the previous level of %0a%3c GAR. Whatever is left is designated by a sign called Holam—Vav with a dot above %0a%3c it, as this is the right line, Ohr Hassadim. %0a%3c %0a%3c Then, in the big state, the letters Ale£>h-Lame%3ciHe;y (ELEH) returned to Bina %0a%3c and joined with Yod-Mem (IM). Subsequently, the level of GAR returned, yet the %0a%3c Light of Hochma in Bina was incomplete, for the Light of Hassadim disappeared %0a%3c and the Light of Hochma cannot shine without the Light of Hassadim. The %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 171 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c returned letters A-L-H are Shuruk—Vav with a dot inside it, because, due to the %0a%3c restrictions in it, it constitutes the left line. %0a%3c %0a%3c These restrictions are effective until ZON, upon ascending to Bina, begin to %0a%3c receive the Light, and the middle line emerges and reduces GAR of Hochma in %0a%3c the left line. As a result, the right line joins with the left: Ohr Hochma shines in %0a%3c the Ohr Hassadim. This middle line is called Hirik—Vav with a dot under it, or %0a%3c the screen of Hirik, for the Light enters the Partzuf because of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c And since Bina regained GAR with ZA's help, ZA, now that he had acquired %0a%3c the three lines, begins to receive this Light from Bina, too. Yod-Mem (IM), Tet %0a%3c and Holam constitute the right line, Aleph-Lamed-Hey (ELEH), Reish and Shuruk %0a%3c constitute the left. %0a%3c %0a%3c Now let us translate this into the language of Sefirot. When Bina returned %0a%3c once more to the state of Gadlut, ELEH returned to IM, the left line merged %0a%3c with the right, and this drove Tet (right line, Hassadim) away from Reish (left %0a%3c line). This is because being opposite to each other, they cannot stand side by %0a%3c side until the Creator (ZA, middle line) reduces the GAR of both the left and %0a%3c right lines by the force of His screen, which is expressed by the words: "And the %0a%3c Creator commanded it to return to its place." %0a%3c %0a%3c GAR de Hochma is called Man 'ula— the lock that prevents the Light from %0a%3c entering a Partzuf, and its diminution is called Miftacha— the key that opens a %0a%3c passage for the Light, VAK of Hochma, to spread in the left line into a Partzuf. %0a%3c Then, Tet, the right line, receives Ohr Hochma from the left, joins with Reish, %0a%3c receiving from it the Light of Hochma. Otherwise it would have remained in %0a%3c VAK. Adam, too, is created from the union of these two lines. %0a%3c %0a%3c But why was the letter Tet reluctant to join with the letter Reish, and had %0a%3c to be forced to do so by the Creator? In the spiritual world, a root rules over %0a%3c all its branches, and the branches submit to its rule. Therefore, Tet did not %0a%3c wish to join with Reish, as it was then bound to become a branch and submit %0a%3c to its root, Reish. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the Creator wanted Tet to receive the Light of Hochma from Reish %0a%3c so that this union would enable man to receive the Light of GAR. Thus, when %0a%3c ELEH return to Bina, He made it so Bina's restrictions would be weakened so as %0a%3c to allow the Reish to join with the Tet and receive the Light of Hassadim from it. It %0a%3c follows that Tet becomes the root with regard to Reish, for without its Hassadim, %0a%3c Reish would be unable to shine, due to the restrictions placed on its Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 172 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER ZAYIN %0a%3c %0a%3c 34. The letter Zayin entered and said: "Maker of the world, it would be good %0a%3c to create the world by me, as Shabbat is preserved with me, for it is written: %0a%3c 'Remember (Zachor) the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it.'" The Creator %0a%3c replied: "I will not create the world by you, for within you is a force of war, as %0a%3c sabers and swords, called Klei Zayin (weaponry), are made by you. And you %0a%3c are like the letter Nun, with which the world was not created, for within it is %0a%3c Nefilah (fall)" (item 29). Having heard that, the letter Zayin left Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Zayin is depicted as a combination of Vav and Yod, as a head over %0a%3c it, which signifies the big state and the great Light in Malchut, ZA's wife, for %0a%3c Malchut includes herself into her husband, ZA (designated by Vav), and becomes %0a%3c a crown (Yod) on his head. Together, these two letters, Vav with Yod standing %0a%3c above it, form the letter Zayin. %0a%3c %0a%3c Therefore, it is written: "Remember the day of Shabbat, so as to keep it holy." %0a%3c As a result of Shabbat's elevation, that is, Nukva's ascent to the head of ZA, when %0a%3c she becomes his crown, she includes herself in the word Zachor (remember) and %0a%3c receives the name Nukva Kedoshah (holy Nukva). This is why the letter Zayin %0a%3c claimed that since this Light is so great and holy that it brings absolute rest on %0a%3c this day, for purity is completely separated from impurity in this state called %0a%3c Shabbat, it is worthy of becoming the basis for the creation of the world. %0a%3c %0a%3c Zayin is the Sefira Net^ah in ZA. When Nukva is included in Net^ah and %0a%3c merges with its properties, she gains the strength to ascend along with ZA to %0a%3c AVI. There she becomes a crown on his head, by which he is adorned, which %0a%3c signifies the day of Shabbat. However, since this correction occurs solely as a %0a%3c result of her inclusion in the male essence and their ascent to AVI, and not in %0a%3c her regular place, where she normally abides with ZA, Nukva cannot be corrected %0a%3c completely during the 6,000 years. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reason for this is that when Nukva returns to her place on weekdays, her %0a%3c connection with the letter Za^in is defined as a Kli Zayin (weapon), and all the wars %0a%3c with the impure forces emerge from her, like the weekdays that prepare Shabbat. %0a%3c %0a%3c For every man must defeat the impure force within him on the weekdays, %0a%3c and thus merit the King's daughter— Shabbat. However, during the 6,000 years, %0a%3c the Light of Shabbat is insufficient for the neutralization of the impure forces, %0a%3c for weekdays return and surround the Shabbat. This continues until the end %0a%3c of correction, when there will be only Shabbat as the day of absolute perfection %0a%3c for all eternity. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 173 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c This is also why the Creator replied to Zayin: "I will not create the world with %0a%3c you, for when you are in your place, your Light is not yet perfect. Only after you %0a%3c defeat the impure forces in war will man be able to attain you." And the shape of %0a%3c the letter Vav (ZA) resembles a spear, ready to strike and pierce through the impure %0a%3c forces. For Gevurot (courage) signifies the left line of Bina's male part (Nun). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS VAV AND HEY %0a%3c %0a%3c 35. The letter Vav entered and said: "It would be good to create the world %0a%3c with me, for I am a letter from Your Name HaVaYaH (Yod-Hey-Vav-Hey)." %0a%3c The Creator replied: "Vav, both you and the letter Hey should just be glad to %0a%3c be contained within My Name. This is why I will not create the world with %0a%3c your properties." %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the letter Yod expressed a similar request, Vav thought that Yod %0a%3c had been turned down because of its excessive size (spiritual force). This is why %0a%3c Vav claimed that it would be good to create the world with its properties, i.e., %0a%3c according to the letters Vav-Hey in the name HaVaYaH, with the Light of the %0a%3c Supernal Bina (Ima) of the world of Atzilut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator responded with the same answer he had given to the letter %0a%3c Yod— that He restricted it by saying to DaY (Dalet-Yod): "Stop at the letter Shin %0a%3c and spread no more, so that the impure forces would not cling to you." Hence, %0a%3c the letters Vav and Hey are not suitable for the world to be created with their %0a%3c properties, for even they need protection against the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sefira Tifferet is designated by the big letter Vav (Vav with a head), for it has %0a%3c all six (Vav) Sefirot: Hesed-Gevura-Tifferet-Netzah-Hod-Yesod. Yesod is the Sefira that is %0a%3c responsible for passing the Light from ZA to Malchut. This is why it has the same %0a%3c Light as in Malchut— NHY without HGT, and this is also why Yesod is called the %0a%3c small Vav (Vav without a head). %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTERS DALET AND QIMEL %0a%3c %0a%3c 36. The letters Dalet and Qimel appeared before the Creator. However, the %0a%3c Creator told them right away: "It is enough that you are both together, so that %0a%3c as long as the poor exist on earth, there is someone to treat them with mercy %0a%3c (LiQmol Hesed)." The letter Dalet derives from Dalut (poverty), while Qimel %0a%3c renders mercy to it (Qomelet Hassadim). "Therefore, you cannot part, and it %0a%3c is enough for you to aid one another in this way." %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 174 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c It was already stated (item 24) that although Dalet receives the Light from %0a%3c Gzme! and its sharp right angle protrudes from the Light of Hassadim, the impure %0a%3c forces are nonetheless strong enough to cling to it, separate it and make the %0a%3c sharp angle smooth, thus transforming it into the letter Reish. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why the letter Dalet requires special protection so as not to be %0a%3c corrupted and to be able to continue being fulfilled by Gimel so as to keep the %0a%3c needy ones (Dalut) in the world from disappearing. Thus, it is sufficient for %0a%3c these two forces to sustain and complement one another, to fulfill one another %0a%3c in reciprocal union so as to prevent the impure forces from ruling. And this %0a%3c role is enough from them. This is why the Creator did not want to create the %0a%3c world with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER BET %0a%3c %0a%3c 37. The letter Bet entered and said to the Creator: "Maker of the world, it %0a%3c would be good to create the world by me, as by me You are blessed Above and %0a%3c below. For Bet is Berachah (blessing)." The Creator replied to Bet: "Of course, %0a%3c I will create the world by you, and you shall be the basis of the world!" %0a%3c %0a%3c The letter Bet is the property of Hochma (wisdom), or rather Hesed in Hochma, %0a%3c a point in a palace, for Ohr Hassadim is a palace for Ohr Hochma and is called %0a%3c Berachah (blessing). Passing through all of the worlds from the Creator down to %0a%3c the lowest degree of the lowest world, this Light does not diminish in any way. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rather, just as this Light is at the Highest Degree that receives it from the %0a%3c World of Infinity, it is just as great, magnificent, and mighty in the world of %0a%3c Atzilut, and likewise all the way down to the world of Assiya. And it does not get %0a%3c coarser or weaker as it passes through all the screens from Above downwards. %0a%3c %0a%3c That is why the letter Bet vied for the world to be created with its properties, %0a%3c as the Light of blessing is the same both Above and below; no screen can weaken %0a%3c it and no coarse desires can harm it. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is also why the property of mercy (Hassadim) is most suitable for the %0a%3c creation of the world, for no impure forces can cling to it. This is because the %0a%3c impure forces can only cling to a place where there is a deficiency. And since %0a%3c there is no deficiency of any kind in the property of mercy, there can never be %0a%3c any contact between Bet and the impure forces. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator agreed with Bet that its property is perfect and suitable for %0a%3c the creation of the universe by Him. As it is said: "Olam (world) Hesed (mercy) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 175 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c YiBaneh (will be built)," where YiBaneh means Boneh (building) and HaVana %0a%3c (understanding). (In Hebrew, the letters Vav and Bet are denoted by the letter %0a%3c Bet). This is because the Creator determined that this property is entirely %0a%3c sufficient for precisely evaluating and separating pure from impure. %0a%3c %0a%3c And if man seeks an idol in the Creator's stead, a Berachah (blessing) does %0a%3c not descend upon him, for blessing stems from the Creator alone. Thus, it is %0a%3c possible to determine who is righteous and who is a sinner, who works for the %0a%3c Creator's sake and who works for himself, for the world is built by mercy. %0a%3c %0a%3c Yet, the Creator did not order the Light of Mercy to rule the world. He merely %0a%3c intended it for a good beginning, sufficient to bring the world to perfection. This %0a%3c is because the Light of Hassadim is incomplete (VAK, and not GAR), insufficient %0a%3c for begetting new souls, for their union and multiplication, as no Partzuf (spiritual %0a%3c object) can beget until it attains the full Light of Hochma, termed GAR or head. %0a%3c Until then, the Partzuf remains in a state of imperfection. %0a%3c %0a%3c Our normal (the lowest possible) state is determined by the property of the %0a%3c letter Bet. Hence, the Creator laid it as the basis for the creation of the world. In %0a%3c other words, the basis of a state is a state of a pure Partzuf (object), when nothing %0a%3c at all can diminish or impede it. %0a%3c %0a%3c In such a state, an addition of Ohr Hochma to Ohr Hassadim, necessary for %0a%3c the birth of a new Partzuf is no longer considered basic and essential. Rather, it %0a%3c is defined as an addition, i.e., it depends solely on the good deeds of the lower %0a%3c ones. And the fundamental Light, VAK, will never be lacking. %0a%3c %0a%3c THE LETTER ALEPH %0a%3c %0a%3c 38. The letter Aleph stood outside and did not enter to appear before the %0a%3c Creator. The Creator said to it: "Why do you not come to me like all the %0a%3c other letters?" Aleph replied: "Because I saw all the letters leaving your %0a%3c presence without the desired answer. And besides, I saw You presenting the %0a%3c letter Bet with this great gift. And, indeed, the King of the universe cannot %0a%3c take back his gift and give it to another!" The Creator replied: "Although I %0a%3c will create the world by the letter Bet, it is you who will stand at the head %0a%3c of all the letters, and there shall be no unity in Me, but through you alone; %0a%3c all accounts and deeds of this world shall always begin with you, and all of %0a%3c unity shall be in you alone." %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, all the letters' questions are Aliyat MAN— their individual %0a%3c requests, prayers, desires to ascend to the Creator. And the Creator's answers %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 176 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c to them are called Yeridat MAD— the descent of the Light from Above, giving %0a%3c strength and abundance according to the letters' requests. The great perfection %0a%3c in the letter Aleph stems not from the lower ones' request for spiritual ascent and %0a%3c correction, but from a force (Light) descending from Above and elevating those %0a%3c that dwell below. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is why from the beginning of correction to its end, Aleph (unlike the %0a%3c other letters, whose properties fuel the process of correction during the 6,000 %0a%3c years) is never stimulated to raise its request to the Creator. And only if the Light %0a%3c that bestows strength for spiritual ascent descends from Above and begins to %0a%3c shine upon Aleph will it be stimulated. However, this will only take place at the %0a%3c end of correction. %0a%3c %0a%3c Aleph did not raise its plea (MAN) to the Creator, for it saw that all the other %0a%3c letters asked, but to no avail, for there was an opposite property in the system %0a%3c of the impure forces against each of their properties. Therefore, Aleph decided %0a%3c that it was no better than the rest, that there is a corresponding impure force %0a%3c against it as well. %0a%3c %0a%3c Furthermore, it raised no requests (MAN) to the Creator because it saw that %0a%3c the Creator decided to create the world with the letter Bet, mercy. And since it %0a%3c had no doubt that His decision was irrevocable, it decided not to ask Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Although it is true that the world was already created with the property of %0a%3c Bet, and that the Creator will not turn His gift over to another letter, the Partzuf %0a%3c that was created by the property of Bet is incomplete, small, VAK without a head. %0a%3c And since a Partzuf needs a head in order to reach the state of Gadlut, which is %0a%3c possible only when the Partzuf is filled not only with the Light of Mercy (Has- %0a%3c sadim), but also with the Light of Wisdom (Hochma), more letters are necessary %0a%3c for the connection, conception and birth of a new Partzuf, a new state. %0a%3c %0a%3c A state of Gadlut can only be achieved with the help of the property of the %0a%3c letter Aleph. Only Aleph can bring a Partzuf to Gadlut, to supplement its body, %0a%3c VAK, with a head, GAR, Mochin— the Light of Hochma. The letter Aleph brings %0a%3c the union between ZA and Malchut in a face-to-face position, whereas previously, %0a%3c in Katnut, while being filled with only the Light of Mercy, ZA and Malchut were %0a%3c connected back-to-back. This is why Alef>h creates a head for all the letters, and %0a%3c hence stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator said: " That is why My Unity in the world is expressed only through %0a%3c the property of the letter Aleph. Furthermore, all rewards and punishments, %0a%3c distancing and drawing nearer, as well as the aspiration for spiritual correction %0a%3c (Teshuvah), all of which lead to the achievement of the end of correction, will %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Letters of Rabbi Hamnuna-Saba %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 177 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c only happen by the property of the Aleph. I have made Bet the basis of the Partzuf %0a%3c so that it would be in no way dependent on the deeds of the lower ones. Thus, %0a%3c even if they begin to sin, those above will remain unaffected." %0a%3c %0a%3c He continued: "But the Light in you, Aleph, is directly related to the actions %0a%3c of the lower ones. So if they sin, the Light of Wisdom (the Light of GAR in %0a%3c you) will immediately disappear. But if they correct their actions (Teshuvah), the %0a%3c Light of Hochma will return. And My unity with all the creatures at the end of %0a%3c correction will only be realized through the letter Aleph." %0a%3c %0a%3c Letters are Kelim (plural for Kli— vessel), desires. And this refers to both the %0a%3c individual letters of the alphabet and those that form words. In the names of %0a%3c spiritual objects, letters signify the force of their desire, which the Light can fill. %0a%3c Letters of a simple name, without filling, designate its basis without Light— Kli %0a%3c of Auiut zero with the Light of Nefesh. Letters of a fulfilled name designate the %0a%3c magnitude of desires that are filled by Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two sources of letters: Yod and Aleph. Yod is a genuine source, for %0a%3c when we write something, we begin with a dot (Yod), and then, as we proceed %0a%3c from the dot in one of the four directions, we get a line. Letters are Kelim, %0a%3c desires, in which the Light (pleasure) is received. %0a%3c %0a%3c A desire for something specific may only emerge if: (i %0a%3c unconscious desire is filled with delight, and (ii) the delight exits the desire %0a%3c It is the memories (Reshimot) of past pleasures that lead to the emergence of a %0a%3c true desire to receive it, to feel it once more. And this is the very desire thai %0a%3c is called Kli. %0a%3c %0a%3c A filled Kli cannot be called a desire, for it is satisfied. Therefore, expulsion of %0a%3c ie Light and sensation of spiritual descent constitute the period of the creation %0a%3c ew Kelim for future receptions of Light, for new attainments. Because the %0a%3c first restriction is the reason for the disappearance of Light from all the vessels %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c However, the second restriction is the only true root of all the worlds, %0a%3c because the first restriction was only made on a point, (Phase Four, Malchut, %0a%3c the fourth letter Hey in the Creator's name HaVaYaH). The second restriction, %0a%3c however, was made on Bina, in whom the two points, Bina and Malchut, were %0a%3c joined. The union of the two points forms a line, either vertical or horizontal. If %0a%3c it is a horizontal line, it is called "firmament" or Parsa. %0a%3c %0a%3c The sum of consequences of both the first and second restrictions forms %0a%3c a slanted line (\); GE (Keter-Hochma) is depicted to its right, and AHP (Bina- %0a%3c ZA-Malchut) to its left. Keter-Hochma remain on their previous level and are %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 178 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c designated by the letter Yod, the first root of the world, whereas, a result of the %0a%3c second restriction, designated by a slanted line (\), Bina-ZA-Malchut fell to a lower %0a%3c level. And since the letter Yod is the first, though a very remote root of the worlds, %0a%3c and all the worlds were created afterwards and in accordance with the law of the %0a%3c second restriction, the letter Aleph stands at the head of the alphabet. %0a%3c %0a%3c The kind of Light that fills the spiritual Kli or Partzuf can also be seen from %0a%3c its designation: if it is filled with the Light of Wisdom (Ohr Hochma), the filling %0a%3c is designated by the letter Yod; and if it is filled with the Light of Mercy (Ohr %0a%3c Hassadim), it is the letter Aleph. %0a%3c %0a%3c 39. The Creator made the Upper letters, which refer to the Sefira Bina, %0a%3c large, and the lower letters that refer to Mcdchut— small. Therefore it is said: %0a%3c "BeresHeet Barah" (in the beginning He created)— two words that begin with %0a%3c Bet, and then Elokim Et (the Creator Himself)— two words that begin with %0a%3c Aleph. The first set of Aleph and Bet are letters of Bina, and the second set %0a%3c of Aleph and Bet are letters of Malchut. And they should mutually affect one %0a%3c another with their properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c When the Upper One wishes to give Light to the lower one, it should clothe %0a%3c in the lower one, signified by the first two letters Bet and the two letters Aleph %0a%3c in the first four words of the Torah. For the first, Upper Bet is Bina, the second, %0a%3c lower Bet is ZA, and the first Bet clothes into the second one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Similarly, the first Aleph refers to Bina and clothes into the second Aleph in %0a%3c ZA so as to fill it with Light. Therefore, the two letters Bet are like one letter Bet %0a%3c and the two letters Aleph are like one letter Aleph, since the lower letter merely %0a%3c constitutes the influence of the Upper One, which tells us that the Upper Partzuf %0a%3c fills the lower one. %0a%3c %0a%3c The world cannot be created with Aleph, for the word Arm (cursed) begins %0a%3c with it, and had the world been created with Aleph, the impure forces, called %0a%3c "cursed," would have received great power from the pure forces, called Baruch %0a%3c (blessed). This is why the world (Nukva of ZA) is created with the letter Bet. %0a%3c Likewise, Adam in Nukva of ZA is also created by the power of Bet. Thus, Malchut %0a%3c of the world of Atzilut constitutes the root of all creation, all the worlds, and all %0a%3c that inhabit them. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Supernal Wisdom %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 40. Rabbi Yudai asked, "What does the word BERESHEET mean?" It is %0a%3c the wisdom, upon which the world, ZA, is established to enter the concealed %0a%3c supernal secrets, namely the Light of Bina. Here are the six Supernal and %0a%3c great properties, VAK de Bina, from which everything emerges. The six river %0a%3c mouths, VAK de ZA, that flow into the Great Sea (Malchut) were formed from %0a%3c them. The word BERESHEET consists of the words BARAH (created) and %0a%3c SHEET (Aramaic: six), meaning that six properties were created. Who created %0a%3c them? He who is unmentioned, concealed, and unknown: Arich Anpin. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two types of Ohr Hochma (Light of Wisdom) in the world of Atzilut: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. The original Light, Ohr Hochma of AA, called "the concealed Ohr %0a%3c Hochma." This Light of Hochma is present only in Partzuf AA and %0a%3c does not spread to the lower Partzufim. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Ohr Hochma that descends via thirty-two paths from Bina, who ascended %0a%3c to Rosh de AA to receive Ohr Hochma and pass it to ZA. Hence, the %0a%3c word Beresheet means Be-Resheet, with-Hochma. However, this is not %0a%3c the true Ohr Hochma that is concealed in AA, but rather the Light that %0a%3c descends via thirty-two paths from Bina to ZA and sustains ZON. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written that the world is established on the "concealed supernal secrets," %0a%3c for when ZON (called "world") receive the Light of Hochma of thirty-two paths, %0a%3c they ascend to AVI, the concealed supernal secrets. Hence, it is said that ZON %0a%3c enter the concealed supernal secrets and attain the degree of AVI, as the lower %0a%3c one that ascends to the Upper One becomes equal to it in its properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word BERESHEET, besides being divided into BE-RESHEET, is also %0a%3c divided into BARAHSHEET (in Hebrew, both words are spelled the same), %0a%3c which translates as CREATED SIX— created six Sefirot (properties), called VAK %0a%3c (abbreviation of the words Vav Ketzavot, six extremities/ properties of ZA, from %0a%3c which all creatures emerge). %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 179 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 180 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Sefira Bina fulfills the function of the Sefira Hochma, the source of Ohr %0a%3c Hochma for ZA. Because Maichut ascended to Bina, and Bina departed from Rosh %0a%3c de AA and became like its Guf (body), she cannot receive the Ohr Hochma of AA. %0a%3c %0a%3c But then, thanks to the MAN raised by the lower ones, human beings who %0a%3c are spiritually present in the worlds of BYA, Bina returns to Rosh de AA, receives %0a%3c Ohr Hochma from AA, passes it to ZON, and ZON pass it to all the worlds. It %0a%3c follows that all the worlds emerged from these six properties (extremities), into %0a%3c which Bina was divided. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore written that all six riverheads originate from Bina, and descend %0a%3c into the Great Sea. Bina's division into six properties, VAK, when she exits Rosh %0a%3c de AA, is called "six sources," for this is only a source of Light for ZA. But then, %0a%3c when Bina returns to Rosh de AA, they become Ohr Hochma, called the rivers that %0a%3c descend to Partzuf ZA. %0a%3c %0a%3c And they are called "six rivers," as it is written: "He will drink off the brook %0a%3c in the way; therefore, will he lift up the head" (Tehilim, 110:7). Afterwards, ZA %0a%3c passes this Light into the Great Sea, to his Nukva. The rivers and brooks signify %0a%3c the Light of ZA. VAK de Bina is considered the sources of the Light of Wisdom, %0a%3c Hochma, for it emerged from Bina in the form of VAK with the sole purpose of %0a%3c creating a source of Light for ZON. And had Bina not emerged, ZON would %0a%3c have had no chance of receiving the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c The word Beresheet has several meanings: Bere = Barah— created six properties %0a%3c without Ohr Hochma, as the word Barah signifies concealment. Hence, the word %0a%3c Beresheet has two meanings: %0a%3c %0a%3c 1. Hochma, as the word Resheet means Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c 2. Barah Sheet, which shows how the Sefira Hochma was divided into six %0a%3c parts without a Rosh, without Ohr Hochma. These six parts are the %0a%3c source of Light for ZON (called the "world"), and these six parts of ZA %0a%3c together with Maichut are called the "seven days of creation." %0a%3c %0a%3c However, since the word Barah is inside the word Beresheet, this means that %0a%3c it was created by "Him who is concealed and unknown," i.e., the concealed %0a%3c Hochma of Arich Anf>in, for it expelled Bina from its Rosh and turned her into %0a%3c VAK. In other words, it created the six parts described in Beresheet. %0a%3c %0a%3c Beresheet designates Hochma. The Light cannot descend to ZA until Ima-Bina %0a%3c comes outside, for because of Tzimtzum Bet, ZAT de Bina fell to ZON. Hence, when %0a%3c Bina is in Gadlut, ZA receives Ohr Hochma in his Kelim, the desires of Bina. The word %0a%3c Barah in Beresheet = Barah Sheet also means Bar (Hebrew, to exit, to transcend). %0a\ No newline at end of file%0a
