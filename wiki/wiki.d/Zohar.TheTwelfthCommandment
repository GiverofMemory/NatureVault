csum=The Twelfth Commandment     245. The twelfth Mitzva is to bring the first fruits of the trees as an offering,  as it is written, "And every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed"  (Beresheet, 1:29). All that is worthy of Me shall not be eaten by you. I have  given you My permission and I have given you all the tithe and offerings of the  trees. "To you," and not to the subsequent generations.
