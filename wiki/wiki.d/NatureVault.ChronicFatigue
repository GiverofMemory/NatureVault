Also [[homocysteine]] is related to [[collagen]].%0a%0aMy suspicion is it is caused by [[PGE2]] and/or [[PGD2]] over expression.%0a%0aWe have all heard of "mono" or mononucleosis, aka the kissing disease, that causes fatigue and tiredness.%0a%0aWell there are also bacteria called [[intracellular bacteria]] that also cause mononucleosis.  Some of these can be primarily acute like [[listeria]], or lifelong like [[brucella]].  [[Intracellular bacteria]] along with a few viruses are implicated in chronic fatigue [[https://www.moleculeralabs.com/autoimmune-fatigue/|#]].  Some of these bacteria, especially [[brucella]], also seem to cause [[myositis]] which seems related.%0a%0aSymptoms most related to CFS include [[depression]] and [[anxiety]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16738080/|#]].%0a%0a!!Treatments%0a%0aSee also [[chronic fatigue treatment]]%0a%0a[[Elecampane]] [[https://www.eclecticschoolofherbalmedicine.com/elecampane-monograph/|#]]%0a%0aThe treatment really depends on the cause of the fatigue, visit the linked bacteria pages below for more info.%0a%0a[[Citronella]] really seems to be helping with a low level broad feeling fatigue linked with [[insomnia]].%0a%0a!!Complex V%0a%0aMitochondrial complex V implicated [[ https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2020/11/19/coq10-fibromyalgia-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-review/|#]], which is also effected by parasites like [[malaria]] [[https://ij.hapres.com/htmls/IJ_1088_Detail.html|#]]%0a%0a!!Insulin Resistance%0aIf you get tired after eating, [[Insulin Resistance]] may play a big role, also linked with [[Listeria]].

Sleep and rest help this one.  [[Listeria]] combated with [[ellagic acid]].  [[Listeria]] also tends to cause [[abscess]].%0a%0a!!Brucella%0a[[Brucella]] likely causes chronic fatigue with [[myositis]], ie: a feeling of weak hands or grip when awakening from sleep.  Brucella combatted with [[cinnamon]].%0a%0a!!Giardia%0a[[Giardia]] is also linked to particularly debilitating chronic fatigue.  It presents with foul smelling excrement (like dog feces) and [[diarrhea]] or loose stools.
