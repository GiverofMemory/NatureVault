text=Also called "NatureHacker's Understandings" or "NatureHacker's Postulates of Disease" or "NatureHacker's Tenents of Disease"%0a%0a[[http://web.archive.org/web/20201126210411/http://www.naturewiki.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/NatureWiki/NatureHackersPostulates | archive]]%0a%0aI believe all of Koch's Postulates are 100%25 bullshit* and show absolute lack of knowledge of the micro realm.%0aKoch's postulates are the following:%0a%0a#%25red%25The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.%0a#%25red%25The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.%0a#%25red%25The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.%0a#%25red%25The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.%0a%0aInstead let's make some better postulates (that are probably not 100%25 true either, but at least put us closer rather than blocking the goal of understanding disease; unlike Koch. * See bottom of page for more info.).%0a%0a# All diseases have either a proximal or root cause of microorganisms (and/or macro parasites; hitherto included in 'microorganisms').  For humans this is almost always bacteria or a select few fungi or parasites.  To be more specific; microbial toxins, or other biological changes induced by bacteria, are one of the main causes of every single disease.%0a%0a# All microorganisms can be killed or suppressed with common and safe, foods or herbs (hitherto referred to as herbs). And thus all diseases are safely treatable with herbs.%0a%0a# There are no completely harmless or essential microorganisms (probiotics).  There can be a mutual benefit that may outweigh the problems caused for certain individuals or individual circumstances, including but not limited to the out-competing of worse microorganisms or providing rare or difficult to make nutrients and nucleic acids, but there will always be trade-offs.  Humans can survive, thrive, and optimize health by eliminating all bacteria if done safely and sustainably.%0a%0a# All viruses are inherently bad at infecting animals and must use a microorganism or otherwise induced weakness in the host or external enhancement of the virus to create a disease state.  In humans this is almost always a certain type(s) of bacterial presence that is required by the virus to cause infection.  Nearly all of the symptoms of said viral disease are due to enhancement of certain bacteria and those bacterial toxins.%0a%0a# Genetic mutations or heritable traits are not a standalone cause of disease but can be a contributing cause. Viruses, bacteria, environment, and even the body itself can mutate DNA or otherwise regulate its use.  DNA is almost always repaired sufficiently to prevent disease unless there is a persistent attack on the creature's homeostasis or there is a lack of nucleic acids in the diet.  Neutralizing the attack and/or supplementing with nucleic acids preferably in the form of unbroken and wild DNA and/or RNA, can help the body repair it's genetic code.%0a%0a# Just because all disease is microbial, does not mean all disease is infectious.  Other factors may be required to replicate a disease state in a host, including factors that cause susceptibility to a microorganism. Also it does not mean that disease cannot be heritable.  Effects of the microbes on DNA may be able to be inherited in some cases but primarily the microbes themselves can be passed on heritably.  Also genetics that can cause either enhanced or reduced immunity to certain microorganisms can be inherited.  These two reasons mean that chronic or acute infection can be inherited, either directly (passing on the microbes) or indirectly (passing on low resistance to the microbes), very likely both.  Poisons that the mother was exposed to can also be passed to the fetus or concentrated in the fetus as well, which can be a cause of future disease.%0a%0a# Autoimmune diseases usually originate from cross reactivity between a microbial antigen and the creatures own proteins, to the immune system; or the hijacking of a creature's cell to produce antigens.  Allergies are similar but instead of cross reactivity with the creature's own proteins, there is cross reactivity with external proteins like foods.%0a%0a# Other causes of disease can be poisons or toxins (including an overabundance of necessary minerals like iron) or deficiencies or trauma including radiation or otherwise things that impair proper functioning of the creature and especially the creature's immune system.  In these cases, microorganisms are still the proximal cause of the disease with the poison or toxin or trauma bieng the root cause.%0a%0a# The body inherently wants to expel toxins and poisons including microbial toxins therefore helping the body expel them such as in the gut with activated charcoal or preventing microbial breakdown of detoxified substances like glucuronides etc, will help reduce the disease state.%0a%0a# Drugs do not treat disease.  Drugs can be useful in diagnosing disease, masking symptoms, and perhaps helping the immune system get the upper hand on disease (like anti-inflammatories) but they cannot directly treat disease.  Herbs can be drugs or antimicrobial and only antimicrobial herbs directly treat disease.  Other causes can be directly treated such as chelation of harmful elements, detoxing of poisons, supplementing deficiencies, etc.  Effective treatment can also include supporting the bodies natural mechanisms for fighting or removing harmful things.%0a%0a# To determine which microorganism is responsible for a disease the creature should either be tested for an overgrowth of microorganisms in relevant areas (the gut is always relevant) or symptoms matched with others that had an overgrowth of microorganisms.  %0a%0a# Many diseases have various and optional symptoms and this relates to poly-microbial causes of many diseases, also differences in hosts responses to microorganisms and other hitherto mentioned causes of disease.%0a%0aWhy does any of this matter?  The reason is that in order to be able to figure out a problem with the body and effectively fix it, you have to understand these things about disease.  Maybe just maybe there is some disease out there that has no relation to microbes.  I haven't found one yet and even if there is, that doesn't change the fact that you should look for microbial causes because there is an overwhelming possibility that it does have one or more, and microbial causes are generally easy to treat.%0a%0a(*)Why do I attack Koch's postulates when they were revolutionary for the time?  Maybe I'm wrong but studying the postulates and Koch's history, it is clear to me Koch was using these postulates to block other scientists from discovering microbial causes for disease and to make hurdles for them to prove a causation.  Koch linked 3 bacteria to 3 diseases and he wanted the standard of proof to be almost insurmountably high so he could be the only one to prove a link.  He invented methods to culture several bacteria and kept lots of info secret, including the ingredients to a tuberculosis vaccine he invented which caused many deaths.  Now Big Pharma (medical industry) uses Koch's postulates in the same way, even though they are entirely debunked, to create a large hurdle to linking microorganisms to disease so they can sell more synthetic and dangerous drugs, and claim that herbs are not effective.%0a
