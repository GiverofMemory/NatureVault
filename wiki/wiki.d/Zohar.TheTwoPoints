text=The Two Points %0a%0a%0a%0a120. Rabbi Chiya began and opened, "The beginning of Hochma (wisdom) is %0afear of the Creator, and those who observe this rule receive all the goodness." %0aHe asks, "The beginning of wisdom? One should rather say that the end of %0awisdom is the fear of the Creator, for fear of the Creator is the property %0aof Malchut, which is at the end of Hochma (wisdom)." He replies, "Yet, %0aM.alchut is the beginning of the entrance to the degrees of reception of the %0aSupernal wisdom." Hence, it is written, "Open to me the gates of justice," %0ameaning that the gates of M.alchut, called "justice," are the Creator's gates. %0aAnd if man does not enter these gates he shall not reach the Supernal King %0athrough any other, for He is concealed and detached, and has erected many %0agates on the path to Him. %0a%0aFear of the Creator is the Sefira Malchut. Yet, how can Malchut serve as an %0aentrance if she is the last of the ten SefirotJ Indeed, she may be called the end of %0aHochma or of a Partzuf, but not the beginning. However, this is not an allegorical %0aexpression, but the essence itself, for HE IS CONCEALED AND DETACHED %0aand no thought of man can attain Him. Hence, He has put up many gates %0aON THE PATH TO HIM, and thanks to these gates He grants sufferers the %0aopportunity to draw closer to him, the opportunity for attainment. %0a%0aThis is precisely what the verse, "Open to me the gates of justice," (Tehilim, %0a118) alludes to; these are the very gates that the Creator made, through %0awhich people can come to Him. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF ALL THE %0aGATES ERECTED A SPECIAL GATE WITH MANY LOCKS. This gate is %0aMalchut de Malchut, the ultimate point of all creation, the ultimate point of %0aall Supernal gates. %0a%0aAnd this last gate (from Above downwards) is the first gate to Supernal %0awisdom (from below upwards), for it is impossible to attain the Supernal Hochma %0a%0a271 %0a%0a%0a%0a27 2 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a(wisdom) without attaining precisely this final gate, as it is the first gate with %0aregard to attainment of the Supernal wisdom. It is therefore written (Tehilim, %0a111:10): "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom," as fear of the Creator %0ais called the final gate, which stands first on the path to Supernal attainment. %0a%0a121. And at the end of all the gates He erected a special gate with several %0alocks, several entrances, and several chambers, one atop of the other. And He %0asaid, "Whoever wishes to reach Me, let this be the first gate on his way to Me. %0aWhoever enters through this gate— will enter." Only this is the first gate to the %0aSupernal wisdom, the gate of fear of the Creator, Malchut, which is hence %0acalled "beginning." %0a%0aThe locks, entrances, and chambers are three successive processes of %0aattainment, of realizing the spiritual in one's inner sensation. The thought that %0acreated the world was the Creator's thought to make a creation (the human %0asoul) in order to fill it with delight. However, it is impossible to feel delight as %0along as one is removed from the Creator, for He is the only One in existence. %0aAnd He has created us in such a way that the nearer we come to Him, the greater %0adelight we feel, whereas the farther we are from Him, the more we suffer. %0a%0aThose of us who live in and perceive only this world can only accept the above %0awords on faith or reject them. However, Kabbalists, who ascend spiritually and %0adraw closer to the Creator, make these assertions and describe their attainments %0afor us. And as to how and when we shall travel the same path to the Creator and %0aattain complete unity with Him, this depends on us alone. However, regardless %0aof whether we want to or not, we will need to travel the entire path from our %0aworld to complete unity with the Creator while still existing in this body, during %0aone of our lifetimes in this world. This is the purpose of creation, and until it is %0afulfilled, man must reincarnate and return to this world, as the sages said: "The %0aCreator wished to dwell in the lower ones." %0a%0aOur world is built completely opposite from the Creator, as it was created %0ain the property of egoistic will to receive pleasure, and this property is the exact %0aantithesis to the Creator's property (desire) to delight us. Additionally, there is %0ano trace of a will to receive pleasure in the Creator Himself. %0a%0aIt is hence said about a person in our world: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" %0a(lyov, 11:12). Therefore, to those who live in this world, the Creator's governance %0aseems completely opposite to the purpose of creation— to delight the creatures. %0aAfter all, that is how we perceive His rule over us, and feel the surrounding %0aworld in our egoistic sensations. %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Two Points %0a%0a%0a%0a273 %0a%0a%0a%0a%0ading to the Creator's plan, one must correct his egoistic desires %0am altruistic, whereupon the Creator fulfills them with superr %0at (to the extent of their correction). Until one attains this stat %0aesire to enjoy either this world or the spiritual. %0a%0aThese sensations are called "gate locks," for all the numerous contradictior %0ato the oneness of the Creator's actions that we feel in this world separate us %0afrom the Creator and prevent us from drawing closer to Him. However, when %0awe exert to observe the To rah and Mitzvot with love, with our heart and soul, %0aas devotedly as it was prescribed for us, with the sole intention of pleasing the %0aeator and without any benefit for ourselves, all of the forces that separate %0aHim and every contradiction that we overcome on our path to Him %0aa gate of attainment of His Supernal wisdom, of Ohr Hochma. This is %0abecause every contradiction reveals its own uniqueness in the attainment of the %0aCreator's governance. %0a%0aThus, those very questions and contradictions, which initially seemed %0ato prevent us from accepting the oneness of the Creator's governance, then %0aturn into knowledge, thanks to which we come to understand and attain the %0aoneness of His governance. %0a%0aAnd those who merit this transform darkness into Light (within themselves) %0aand bitterness into sweetness. This is how they feel their attainments— in precisely %0athose past sensations of darkness and bitterness. For the forces that repel us %0afrom the Creator, that form our minds and are perceived by the body as bitter %0aturn into gates of attainment of Supernal Degrees. This way, darkness becomes %0aLight and bitterness becomes sweetness. %0a%0aAnd the more negative the Creator's governance is first perceived, %0adeeper man eventually comes to realize the perfection of His governance. At %0alast, the entire world ends up on the scale of merit, for every force and insight %0anow serve as SHAAREY TZEDEJC (the gates of truth), through which one can %0aenter and receive from the Creator everything that He intended to bestow at the %0aThought of Creation. Thus, it is written about such contradictions that turn %0ainto realization of unity: "These are the gates to the Creator; the righteous shall %0a%0aHence, until one merits turning his will "to receive for himself into the will %0a"to receive for the Creator" with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot, all the gates %0ato the Creator have sturdy locks (the sensation of imperfection in the Creator's %0a%0a%0a%0aome %0a, the %0a%0a%0a%0a274 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aeator. And they are called locks, for they lock the gates of > %0a•eator and distance us from %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a;fore we %0aCreator's %0ayeetness %0a; e goism %0a%0a%0a%0aawever, if we make efforts to overcon %0aikening our love for the Creator, we %0aentrances, darkness into Light, and bitterness into sweetness. This is because %0afor every lock we receive a special degree of attainment of the Creator. These %0adegrees become entrances that lead to the degrees of sensation of the Creator %0aHimself. And the degrees themselves turn into halls or chambers of wisdom. %0a%0aThus, we see that locks, entrances, and chambers constitute the three types %0aof perception of one material, our will to receive or egoism. Indeed, before we %0axe egoistic desire to receive into reception (of pleasure) for the Create %0altruism, this material transforms Light into darkness and swe %0aless, in accordance with our (egoistic) taste. In other words, %0afinds suffering in the same types of influence that bring pleasure to altruism. %0aTherefore, to perceive the Light (delight) that surrounds us, we only need %0ato change our senses. But until we do, this Light will be perceived by us as %0adarkness and suffering. %0a%0aInitially, whatever examples of the Creator's governance we see, they distance %0aus from Him. This is because we perceive them negatively; at that very moment, %0aour egoism (will to receive pleasure) begets locks. However, once we transform %0aour desires to "reception for the Creator's sake," these locks become entrances, %0aand entrances turn into chambers— vessels of wisdom, Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aAs we already know, the end of all the degrees, i.e., the very last degree, %0abelow which nothing can possibly exist, is called Malchut de Malchut. To attain %0aSupernal wisdom, one must first overcome this last gate, which turns into %0athe first gate to ascend from below upwards, toward the chamber of Supernal %0awisdom, the Sefira Hochma. All gates become entrances and chambers of the %0aCreator's wisdom. This is why it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (the first %0awords in the Torah), for IN THE BEGINNING signifies fear of the Creator, %0athe last gate (Malchut), which becomes the first on the path to attainment of the %0aSupernal wisdom. %0a%0a122. The letter Bet in the word BERESHEET (IN THE BEGINNING) %0aindicates that the two are joined together in Malchut. Both are points: one %0ais concealed, while the other is revealed. However, since there's no division %0abetween them, they are called THE BEGINNING, which signifies only one, %0arather than two, for he who takes one, takes the other as well, and all is one, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Two Points %0a%0a%0a%0a275 %0a%0a%0a%0afor He and His Name are one, as it is written, "And you shall know that this %0ais the Creator's only name." %0a%0aThe Hebrew letter Bet has a numerical value of two, indicating two points. %0aThese two points symbolize the correction of the egoistic point of Malchut, %0aonto which the point of mercy (Bina) imposes a restriction of use. Correction %0ais achieved when Malchut (strictness) ascends to Bina (mercy), as it is written, %0a"So they both walked" (Rut, 1:19), i.e., Bina and Malchut. Hence, the screen in %0aMalchut consists of both points, and they are thereby joined together as one. %0a%0aIt is explained in Megilat Rut (The Book of Ruth) how Malchut (Ruth) merges %0awith Bina (Naomi), which then leads to the correction of Malchut and the %0abirth of David, the first King (the word King (Melech) is derived from Malchut %0a(kingdom) of Israel). %0a%0aHOWEVER, ONE IS CONCEALED, WHILE THE OTHER IS %0aREVEALED, for the judgment in the point of Malchut is concealed, whereas %0aonly the property of mercy in the point of Bina is revealed. Otherwise, the world %0acould not exist, as it is written, "In the beginning, He created the world with %0athe property of judgment, but seeing that it cannot exist, He attached to it the %0aproperty of mercy" (Beresheet Raba, item 1). %0a%0aAlthough the restriction is concealed, this does not mean that a Zivug is not %0amade on it, since these two points merge into one, and the point of Malchut %0areceives a Zivug together with the point of Bina, though it participates in it %0asecretly. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING, for the word "beginning" %0aindicates one point, which includes two that are as one. %0a%0aBecause Malchut participates with Bina in all the Zivugim that are made %0aduring the 6,000 years (albeit secretly), she corrects herself to such an extent that %0aat the end of all the corrections, even her property of restriction is corrected, %0aand she acquires the property of Bina. It is written of this state that on that day %0aHe and His Name will be one. %0a%0aSince the properly of restriction is also concealed within the letter Bet of %0athe word BERESHEET (in the beginning), this property is called RESHEET %0a(first) in Hochma (wisdom). However, the correction of this property occurs %0aonly at the end of corrections, when the Supernal wisdom is revealed, as the %0aprophet said: "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Creator" %0a(Yeshayahu, 11:9). This is because the last gate will become the first. Hence, it is %0awritten, "That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the Lord, the %0aMost High over all the earth," (Tehilim, 83:19) for the Creator's wisdom will be %0arevealed in our world to all. %0a%0a%0a%0a276 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0a123. Why is Malchut called "fear of the Creator?" It is because Malchut is the %0aTree of Good and Evil: If man merits, it is good, but if he does not, it is evil. %0aThis is why fear dwells in that place. And this gate leads to all the goodness %0athat exists in the world. ALL THE GOODNESS signifies two gates, two points %0athat are as one. Rabbi Yosi said that ALL THE GOODNESS refers to the Tree %0aof Life, for it is entirely good and completely without evil. And because it is %0awithout evil, it is entirely good, without evil. %0a%0aIt is written of the last gate: THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS FEAR %0aOF THE CREATOR. So why is it called "fear of the Creator?" Because this %0ais the secret of the Tree of Knowledge, by which Adam sinned, for the use of %0athat point (egoistic desires) is punishable by death (disappearance of the Light). %0aAnd great fear is needed to refrain from touching (using) it before all the other %0adesires have been corrected. Nevertheless, at the end of correction, when even %0athis point is completely corrected, death will cease to exist for all eternity. That %0ais why it is called "fear." %0a%0aThe Creator created one creation— the egoistic Malchut. The goal of creation %0ais to fill her with the Creator's Light using an altruistic intention. As a result, %0aMalchut merges with the Creator and receives limitless delight. %0a%0aMalchut, the only creation, consists of five parts: KHB ZAM. Her parts %0aKHB ZA, excluding Malchut de Malchut, have altruistic properties, which they %0areceived from the Light. %0a%0aAs a result of her decision to refrain from receiving Light into egoistic %0adesires, called T^imt^um Aleph (the first restriction), Malchut receives the Light %0aonly in her first four desires: KHB-ZA. Malchut de Malchut remains inaccessible %0ato the Light. So how can she be corrected? %0a%0aTo correct Malchut de Malchut's properties (desires), the Creator creates %0athe conditions under which Bina and Malchut mix, and consequently, Malchut %0aacquires the properties of Bina. %0a%0aThis process needs to occur more than once, so that all of Malchut 's parts %0awill be mixed with Bina. Every time it takes place in an increasingly deeper layer %0aof Malchut, it is called the breaking of holiness, for Bina descends and passes %0aher properties to Malchut, but she herself breaks during this mixing, as though %0alosing her altruistic properties. %0a%0aThus, we can conclude that all the shattering of vessels, the breaking of %0aAdam's soul, the ruin of the First and Second Temples, and other spiritual %0adisasters take place not as punishment, for punishment (as we understand it) %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Two Points %0a%0a%0a%0a277 %0a%0a%0a%0adoes not exist in the spiritual, but only so as to enable the altruistic desires of %0aBina penetrate deeper into the egoistic desires of Malchut. %0a%0aThe last point of Malchut, the yet uncorrected Malchut de Malchut, is that %0avery point the use of which is punishable by death (the Light's disappearance is %0aconsidered death). It is forbidden to use Malchut de Malchut until all the other %0aproperties of Malchut (KHB-ZA) have been fully corrected. Or rather, if man %0arefrains from using egoism (the point of Malchut de Malchut), and uses only %0ahis other altruistic desires, he gradually constructs a "non-reception" screen on %0aMalchut de Malchut. %0a%0aHaving filled all of his corrected desires with Light, man achieves the end %0aof correction— of what he could correct by himself. As soon as that happens, %0ai.e., as soon as one receives the Light in all of his soul's first nine Sefirot (KHB- %0aZA, excluding Malchut), the Light called Mashiach descends from Above, which %0aimparts Malchut de Malchut with the altruistic property of bestowal, of acting for %0athe Creator's sake. This concludes the entire correction process of man's soul, %0aand he attains complete unity with the Creator. The Creator's goal is for man %0ato attain this state while still living in our world and in his physical body, to %0acombine all the worlds, spiritual and material, within himself. %0a%0aAND THIS GATE LEADS TO ALL THE GOODNESS, for there is nothing %0abetter than the revelation of the Supernal wisdom in the world, included in %0athe Thought of Creation. And since fear of the Creator is the last gate to the %0aSupernal wisdom, it also constitutes the gate to all the goodness. %0a%0aTHESE TWO GATES ARE AS ONE refers to the two points, Bina and %0aMalchut, which are united in the letter Bet of the word BERESHEET (IN THE %0aBEGINNING), the first word in the Torah. And the two points are mentioned %0abecause they allude to the state following the correction, when these two points %0aare called "the two gates," for both turn out to be good and free from evil, %0athereby bringing man only perfect goodness. %0a%0aNevertheless, until the end of correction, one must strain to separate within %0ahim the desires that refer to the point of Bina from those that refer to the point %0aof Malchut, to reject the desires of Malchut, and, in defiance of egoism, use %0athe desires of Bina. During man's work on self-correction, called "6,000 years," %0athese two points are referred to as "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%0aRABBI YOSI SAID-Rabbi Yosi does not object to the words of Rabbi Chiya. %0aThey are talking about two different states: Rabbi Chiya alludes to a state past %0athe end of correction of Malchut, when both points become a gate, and there %0ais no more evil within them. And Rabbi Yosi explains a state in the correction %0a%0a%0a%0a278 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Zohar %0a%0a%0a%0aprocess, when the two points, Bina and Malchut, exist within us as our Tree of %0aKnowledge of Good and Evil. Hence, he tells us that ALL THE GOODNESS %0aIS (can only be found in) THE TREE OF LIFE. %0a%0aZA filled with the Light of Ima-Bina is called "The Tree of Life," for he %0apossesses only good properties. And the two points of good and evil, Bina and %0aMalchut, remain within Malchut until the end of correction; hence, Malchut is %0acalled "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%0a124. To all those who act, it is the faithful mercy of David that upholds the %0aTorah. Those who keep the Torah seemingly create it themselves. All those who %0astudy the Torah— there is no action in them as they study, but those who keep %0athe Torah— in them there is action. And the world exists by this force, eternal %0aare the wisdom and the Torah, and the throne stands just as it should stand. %0a%0aIt was previously said that fear of the Creator constitutes the last gate, though %0ait is the first gate to the Supernal wisdom. It turns out that ALL THOSE WHO %0aSTUDY THE TORAH have already corrected the last gate, and the two points %0abecome for them two entrances, all goodness without evil. Hence, it is said that %0aTHERE IS NO ACTION IN THEM, i.e., no analysis of good and evil, for they %0ahave already corrected everything. %0a%0aHowever, those who have not yet reached the end of correction are referred %0ato as those who keep the Torah. There is action in them, for they have not yet %0acorrected good and evil in everyone's Tree of Good and Evil— not everyone has %0arealized in one's inner tree (in all of one's properties) what is good and what is %0aevil with regard to the spiritual truth. %0a%0aIt is therefore said that THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH SEEMINGLY %0aCREATE IT THEMSELVES. As a result of man's effort to refrain from their %0ause, all the distracting and impeding forces (thoughts and desires) of the point %0aof Malchut become gates, all the locks become entrances, and all the entrances %0abecome chambers of wisdom filled with Ohr Hochma. %0a%0aIt follows that all the wisdom and the entire Torah become revealed only %0athrough the efforts of those who keep the Torah. Hence, they SEEMINGLY %0aCREATE IT THEMSELVES. The forces of good and evil are combined within %0athem, and they become those who keep the Torah, for the Torah is revealed %0athanks to their inner work of separating and correcting good and evil. %0a%0aSuch people are called "those who act," for they seemingly create the Torah %0aby themselves. After all, without perceiving the Creator (The Torah, Light) as %0aconcealed, and then overcoming this concealment, thereby turning it into gates, %0a%0a%0a%0aThe Two Points %0a%0a%0a%0a279 %0a%0a%0a%0aThe perfection of the Creator's actions lies in the fact that by creating man %0aso paltry (with such insignificant egoistic desires, completely opposite to the %0aCreator in his properties, and utterly powerless to change himself), the Creator %0agave man an opportunity to become like Him (in properties, greatness, and the %0asensation of creating himself), to create within and by himself all of the worlds %0aand the Torah. By revealing the Light, it is as though man actually creates it. %0a%0aThus, since these individuals reveal the Torah, they are regarded as its %0acreators. The word is SEEMINGLY used to indicate that the Torah was created %0abefore the creation of our world (Talmud, Pesachim, 54:1), and of course, it is the %0awork of the Creator Himself. Yet, without the good deeds of those who keep the %0aTorah, it would not have been revealed to the world. Hence, they are regarded %0aas the makers and creators of the Torah. %0a%0aThe wisdom and the Torah are eternal; that is, they exist even after the %0aend of correction, for fear of the Creator is needed even then. However, once %0athe entire egoism is corrected, there is no place from which to take this fear, %0afor the Tree of Good and Evil becomes only good, and can no longer furnish %0afear of the Creator. %0a%0aHowever, because they received fear in the past, they can continue using it %0ain the present, after the end of correction, when there is nothing left to fear, as %0athere are no restrictions in Malchut. And the only reason they can do so is that %0aduring the correction they worked on creating within them the sensation of the %0aCreator's absolute rule and the eternity of the Torah. And since this fear is never- %0aending, the Creator's throne remains forever standing in their attainment. %0a

Rabbi Chiya began and opened, "The beginning of Hochma (wisdom) is %0a%3c fear of the Creator, and those who observe this rule receive all the goodness." %0a%3c He asks, "The beginning of wisdom? One should rather say that the end of %0a%3c wisdom is the fear of the Creator, for fear of the Creator is the property %0a%3c of Malchut, which is at the end of Hochma (wisdom)." He replies, "Yet, %0a%3c M.alchut is the beginning of the entrance to the degrees of reception of the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom." Hence, it is written, "Open to me the gates of justice," %0a%3c meaning that the gates of M.alchut, called "justice," are the Creator's gates. %0a%3c And if man does not enter these gates he shall not reach the Supernal King %0a%3c through any other, for He is concealed and detached, and has erected many %0a%3c gates on the path to Him. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fear of the Creator is the Sefira Malchut. Yet, how can Malchut serve as an %0a%3c entrance if she is the last of the ten SefirotJ Indeed, she may be called the end of %0a%3c Hochma or of a Partzuf, but not the beginning. However, this is not an allegorical %0a%3c expression, but the essence itself, for HE IS CONCEALED AND DETACHED %0a%3c and no thought of man can attain Him. Hence, He has put up many gates %0a%3c ON THE PATH TO HIM, and thanks to these gates He grants sufferers the %0a%3c opportunity to draw closer to him, the opportunity for attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is precisely what the verse, "Open to me the gates of justice," (Tehilim, %0a%3c 118) alludes to; these are the very gates that the Creator made, through %0a%3c which people can come to Him. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF ALL THE %0a%3c GATES ERECTED A SPECIAL GATE WITH MANY LOCKS. This gate is %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut, the ultimate point of all creation, the ultimate point of %0a%3c all Supernal gates. %0a%3c %0a%3c And this last gate (from Above downwards) is the first gate to Supernal %0a%3c wisdom (from below upwards), for it is impossible to attain the Supernal Hochma %0a%3c %0a%3c 271 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c (wisdom) without attaining precisely this final gate, as it is the first gate with %0a%3c regard to attainment of the Supernal wisdom. It is therefore written (Tehilim, %0a%3c 111:10): "Fear of the Creator is the beginning of wisdom," as fear of the Creator %0a%3c is called the final gate, which stands first on the path to Supernal attainment. %0a%3c %0a%3c 121. And at the end of all the gates He erected a special gate with several %0a%3c locks, several entrances, and several chambers, one atop of the other. And He %0a%3c said, "Whoever wishes to reach Me, let this be the first gate on his way to Me. %0a%3c Whoever enters through this gate— will enter." Only this is the first gate to the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, the gate of fear of the Creator, Malchut, which is hence %0a%3c called "beginning." %0a%3c %0a%3c The locks, entrances, and chambers are three successive processes of %0a%3c attainment, of realizing the spiritual in one's inner sensation. The thought that %0a%3c created the world was the Creator's thought to make a creation (the human %0a%3c soul) in order to fill it with delight. However, it is impossible to feel delight as %0a%3c long as one is removed from the Creator, for He is the only One in existence. %0a%3c And He has created us in such a way that the nearer we come to Him, the greater %0a%3c delight we feel, whereas the farther we are from Him, the more we suffer. %0a%3c %0a%3c Those of us who live in and perceive only this world can only accept the above %0a%3c words on faith or reject them. However, Kabbalists, who ascend spiritually and %0a%3c draw closer to the Creator, make these assertions and describe their attainments %0a%3c for us. And as to how and when we shall travel the same path to the Creator and %0a%3c attain complete unity with Him, this depends on us alone. However, regardless %0a%3c of whether we want to or not, we will need to travel the entire path from our %0a%3c world to complete unity with the Creator while still existing in this body, during %0a%3c one of our lifetimes in this world. This is the purpose of creation, and until it is %0a%3c fulfilled, man must reincarnate and return to this world, as the sages said: "The %0a%3c Creator wished to dwell in the lower ones." %0a%3c %0a%3c Our world is built completely opposite from the Creator, as it was created %0a%3c in the property of egoistic will to receive pleasure, and this property is the exact %0a%3c antithesis to the Creator's property (desire) to delight us. Additionally, there is %0a%3c no trace of a will to receive pleasure in the Creator Himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is hence said about a person in our world: "Man is born akin to a wild ass" %0a%3c (lyov, 11:12). Therefore, to those who live in this world, the Creator's governance %0a%3c seems completely opposite to the purpose of creation— to delight the creatures. %0a%3c After all, that is how we perceive His rule over us, and feel the surrounding %0a%3c world in our egoistic sensations. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 273 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ding to the Creator's plan, one must correct his egoistic desires %0a%3c m altruistic, whereupon the Creator fulfills them with superr %0a%3c t (to the extent of their correction). Until one attains this stat %0a%3c esire to enjoy either this world or the spiritual. %0a%3c %0a%3c These sensations are called "gate locks," for all the numerous contradictior %0a%3c to the oneness of the Creator's actions that we feel in this world separate us %0a%3c from the Creator and prevent us from drawing closer to Him. However, when %0a%3c we exert to observe the To rah and Mitzvot with love, with our heart and soul, %0a%3c as devotedly as it was prescribed for us, with the sole intention of pleasing the %0a%3c eator and without any benefit for ourselves, all of the forces that separate %0a%3c Him and every contradiction that we overcome on our path to Him %0a%3c a gate of attainment of His Supernal wisdom, of Ohr Hochma. This is %0a%3c because every contradiction reveals its own uniqueness in the attainment of the %0a%3c Creator's governance. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, those very questions and contradictions, which initially seemed %0a%3c to prevent us from accepting the oneness of the Creator's governance, then %0a%3c turn into knowledge, thanks to which we come to understand and attain the %0a%3c oneness of His governance. %0a%3c %0a%3c And those who merit this transform darkness into Light (within themselves) %0a%3c and bitterness into sweetness. This is how they feel their attainments— in precisely %0a%3c those past sensations of darkness and bitterness. For the forces that repel us %0a%3c from the Creator, that form our minds and are perceived by the body as bitter %0a%3c turn into gates of attainment of Supernal Degrees. This way, darkness becomes %0a%3c Light and bitterness becomes sweetness. %0a%3c %0a%3c And the more negative the Creator's governance is first perceived, %0a%3c deeper man eventually comes to realize the perfection of His governance. At %0a%3c last, the entire world ends up on the scale of merit, for every force and insight %0a%3c now serve as SHAAREY TZEDEJC (the gates of truth), through which one can %0a%3c enter and receive from the Creator everything that He intended to bestow at the %0a%3c Thought of Creation. Thus, it is written about such contradictions that turn %0a%3c into realization of unity: "These are the gates to the Creator; the righteous shall %0a%3c %0a%3c Hence, until one merits turning his will "to receive for himself into the will %0a%3c "to receive for the Creator" with the help of the Torah and Mitzvot, all the gates %0a%3c to the Creator have sturdy locks (the sensation of imperfection in the Creator's %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ome %0a%3c , the %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 274 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c eator. And they are called locks, for they lock the gates of > %0a%3c •eator and distance us from %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ;fore we %0a%3c Creator's %0a%3c yeetness %0a%3c ; e goism %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c awever, if we make efforts to overcon %0a%3c ikening our love for the Creator, we %0a%3c entrances, darkness into Light, and bitterness into sweetness. This is because %0a%3c for every lock we receive a special degree of attainment of the Creator. These %0a%3c degrees become entrances that lead to the degrees of sensation of the Creator %0a%3c Himself. And the degrees themselves turn into halls or chambers of wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we see that locks, entrances, and chambers constitute the three types %0a%3c of perception of one material, our will to receive or egoism. Indeed, before we %0a%3c xe egoistic desire to receive into reception (of pleasure) for the Create %0a%3c ltruism, this material transforms Light into darkness and swe %0a%3c less, in accordance with our (egoistic) taste. In other words, %0a%3c finds suffering in the same types of influence that bring pleasure to altruism. %0a%3c Therefore, to perceive the Light (delight) that surrounds us, we only need %0a%3c to change our senses. But until we do, this Light will be perceived by us as %0a%3c darkness and suffering. %0a%3c %0a%3c Initially, whatever examples of the Creator's governance we see, they distance %0a%3c us from Him. This is because we perceive them negatively; at that very moment, %0a%3c our egoism (will to receive pleasure) begets locks. However, once we transform %0a%3c our desires to "reception for the Creator's sake," these locks become entrances, %0a%3c and entrances turn into chambers— vessels of wisdom, Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c As we already know, the end of all the degrees, i.e., the very last degree, %0a%3c below which nothing can possibly exist, is called Malchut de Malchut. To attain %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, one must first overcome this last gate, which turns into %0a%3c the first gate to ascend from below upwards, toward the chamber of Supernal %0a%3c wisdom, the Sefira Hochma. All gates become entrances and chambers of the %0a%3c Creator's wisdom. This is why it is written, IN THE BEGINNING (the first %0a%3c words in the Torah), for IN THE BEGINNING signifies fear of the Creator, %0a%3c the last gate (Malchut), which becomes the first on the path to attainment of the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom. %0a%3c %0a%3c 122. The letter Bet in the word BERESHEET (IN THE BEGINNING) %0a%3c indicates that the two are joined together in Malchut. Both are points: one %0a%3c is concealed, while the other is revealed. However, since there's no division %0a%3c between them, they are called THE BEGINNING, which signifies only one, %0a%3c rather than two, for he who takes one, takes the other as well, and all is one, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 275 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c for He and His Name are one, as it is written, "And you shall know that this %0a%3c is the Creator's only name." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Hebrew letter Bet has a numerical value of two, indicating two points. %0a%3c These two points symbolize the correction of the egoistic point of Malchut, %0a%3c onto which the point of mercy (Bina) imposes a restriction of use. Correction %0a%3c is achieved when Malchut (strictness) ascends to Bina (mercy), as it is written, %0a%3c "So they both walked" (Rut, 1:19), i.e., Bina and Malchut. Hence, the screen in %0a%3c Malchut consists of both points, and they are thereby joined together as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is explained in Megilat Rut (The Book of Ruth) how Malchut (Ruth) merges %0a%3c with Bina (Naomi), which then leads to the correction of Malchut and the %0a%3c birth of David, the first King (the word King (Melech) is derived from Malchut %0a%3c (kingdom) of Israel). %0a%3c %0a%3c HOWEVER, ONE IS CONCEALED, WHILE THE OTHER IS %0a%3c REVEALED, for the judgment in the point of Malchut is concealed, whereas %0a%3c only the property of mercy in the point of Bina is revealed. Otherwise, the world %0a%3c could not exist, as it is written, "In the beginning, He created the world with %0a%3c the property of judgment, but seeing that it cannot exist, He attached to it the %0a%3c property of mercy" (Beresheet Raba, item 1). %0a%3c %0a%3c Although the restriction is concealed, this does not mean that a Zivug is not %0a%3c made on it, since these two points merge into one, and the point of Malchut %0a%3c receives a Zivug together with the point of Bina, though it participates in it %0a%3c secretly. Therefore, it is written, IN THE BEGINNING, for the word "beginning" %0a%3c indicates one point, which includes two that are as one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Because Malchut participates with Bina in all the Zivugim that are made %0a%3c during the 6,000 years (albeit secretly), she corrects herself to such an extent that %0a%3c at the end of all the corrections, even her property of restriction is corrected, %0a%3c and she acquires the property of Bina. It is written of this state that on that day %0a%3c He and His Name will be one. %0a%3c %0a%3c Since the properly of restriction is also concealed within the letter Bet of %0a%3c the word BERESHEET (in the beginning), this property is called RESHEET %0a%3c (first) in Hochma (wisdom). However, the correction of this property occurs %0a%3c only at the end of corrections, when the Supernal wisdom is revealed, as the %0a%3c prophet said: "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Creator" %0a%3c (Yeshayahu, 11:9). This is because the last gate will become the first. Hence, it is %0a%3c written, "That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the Lord, the %0a%3c Most High over all the earth," (Tehilim, 83:19) for the Creator's wisdom will be %0a%3c revealed in our world to all. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 276 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 123. Why is Malchut called "fear of the Creator?" It is because Malchut is the %0a%3c Tree of Good and Evil: If man merits, it is good, but if he does not, it is evil. %0a%3c This is why fear dwells in that place. And this gate leads to all the goodness %0a%3c that exists in the world. ALL THE GOODNESS signifies two gates, two points %0a%3c that are as one. Rabbi Yosi said that ALL THE GOODNESS refers to the Tree %0a%3c of Life, for it is entirely good and completely without evil. And because it is %0a%3c without evil, it is entirely good, without evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is written of the last gate: THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS FEAR %0a%3c OF THE CREATOR. So why is it called "fear of the Creator?" Because this %0a%3c is the secret of the Tree of Knowledge, by which Adam sinned, for the use of %0a%3c that point (egoistic desires) is punishable by death (disappearance of the Light). %0a%3c And great fear is needed to refrain from touching (using) it before all the other %0a%3c desires have been corrected. Nevertheless, at the end of correction, when even %0a%3c this point is completely corrected, death will cease to exist for all eternity. That %0a%3c is why it is called "fear." %0a%3c %0a%3c The Creator created one creation— the egoistic Malchut. The goal of creation %0a%3c is to fill her with the Creator's Light using an altruistic intention. As a result, %0a%3c Malchut merges with the Creator and receives limitless delight. %0a%3c %0a%3c Malchut, the only creation, consists of five parts: KHB ZAM. Her parts %0a%3c KHB ZA, excluding Malchut de Malchut, have altruistic properties, which they %0a%3c received from the Light. %0a%3c %0a%3c As a result of her decision to refrain from receiving Light into egoistic %0a%3c desires, called T^imt^um Aleph (the first restriction), Malchut receives the Light %0a%3c only in her first four desires: KHB-ZA. Malchut de Malchut remains inaccessible %0a%3c to the Light. So how can she be corrected? %0a%3c %0a%3c To correct Malchut de Malchut's properties (desires), the Creator creates %0a%3c the conditions under which Bina and Malchut mix, and consequently, Malchut %0a%3c acquires the properties of Bina. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process needs to occur more than once, so that all of Malchut 's parts %0a%3c will be mixed with Bina. Every time it takes place in an increasingly deeper layer %0a%3c of Malchut, it is called the breaking of holiness, for Bina descends and passes %0a%3c her properties to Malchut, but she herself breaks during this mixing, as though %0a%3c losing her altruistic properties. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, we can conclude that all the shattering of vessels, the breaking of %0a%3c Adam's soul, the ruin of the First and Second Temples, and other spiritual %0a%3c disasters take place not as punishment, for punishment (as we understand it) %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 277 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c does not exist in the spiritual, but only so as to enable the altruistic desires of %0a%3c Bina penetrate deeper into the egoistic desires of Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c The last point of Malchut, the yet uncorrected Malchut de Malchut, is that %0a%3c very point the use of which is punishable by death (the Light's disappearance is %0a%3c considered death). It is forbidden to use Malchut de Malchut until all the other %0a%3c properties of Malchut (KHB-ZA) have been fully corrected. Or rather, if man %0a%3c refrains from using egoism (the point of Malchut de Malchut), and uses only %0a%3c his other altruistic desires, he gradually constructs a "non-reception" screen on %0a%3c Malchut de Malchut. %0a%3c %0a%3c Having filled all of his corrected desires with Light, man achieves the end %0a%3c of correction— of what he could correct by himself. As soon as that happens, %0a%3c i.e., as soon as one receives the Light in all of his soul's first nine Sefirot (KHB- %0a%3c ZA, excluding Malchut), the Light called Mashiach descends from Above, which %0a%3c imparts Malchut de Malchut with the altruistic property of bestowal, of acting for %0a%3c the Creator's sake. This concludes the entire correction process of man's soul, %0a%3c and he attains complete unity with the Creator. The Creator's goal is for man %0a%3c to attain this state while still living in our world and in his physical body, to %0a%3c combine all the worlds, spiritual and material, within himself. %0a%3c %0a%3c AND THIS GATE LEADS TO ALL THE GOODNESS, for there is nothing %0a%3c better than the revelation of the Supernal wisdom in the world, included in %0a%3c the Thought of Creation. And since fear of the Creator is the last gate to the %0a%3c Supernal wisdom, it also constitutes the gate to all the goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c THESE TWO GATES ARE AS ONE refers to the two points, Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, which are united in the letter Bet of the word BERESHEET (IN THE %0a%3c BEGINNING), the first word in the Torah. And the two points are mentioned %0a%3c because they allude to the state following the correction, when these two points %0a%3c are called "the two gates," for both turn out to be good and free from evil, %0a%3c thereby bringing man only perfect goodness. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nevertheless, until the end of correction, one must strain to separate within %0a%3c him the desires that refer to the point of Bina from those that refer to the point %0a%3c of Malchut, to reject the desires of Malchut, and, in defiance of egoism, use %0a%3c the desires of Bina. During man's work on self-correction, called "6,000 years," %0a%3c these two points are referred to as "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%3c %0a%3c RABBI YOSI SAID-Rabbi Yosi does not object to the words of Rabbi Chiya. %0a%3c They are talking about two different states: Rabbi Chiya alludes to a state past %0a%3c the end of correction of Malchut, when both points become a gate, and there %0a%3c is no more evil within them. And Rabbi Yosi explains a state in the correction %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 278 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Zohar %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c process, when the two points, Bina and Malchut, exist within us as our Tree of %0a%3c Knowledge of Good and Evil. Hence, he tells us that ALL THE GOODNESS %0a%3c IS (can only be found in) THE TREE OF LIFE. %0a%3c %0a%3c ZA filled with the Light of Ima-Bina is called "The Tree of Life," for he %0a%3c possesses only good properties. And the two points of good and evil, Bina and %0a%3c Malchut, remain within Malchut until the end of correction; hence, Malchut is %0a%3c called "The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil." %0a%3c %0a%3c 124. To all those who act, it is the faithful mercy of David that upholds the %0a%3c Torah. Those who keep the Torah seemingly create it themselves. All those who %0a%3c study the Torah— there is no action in them as they study, but those who keep %0a%3c the Torah— in them there is action. And the world exists by this force, eternal %0a%3c are the wisdom and the Torah, and the throne stands just as it should stand. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was previously said that fear of the Creator constitutes the last gate, though %0a%3c it is the first gate to the Supernal wisdom. It turns out that ALL THOSE WHO %0a%3c STUDY THE TORAH have already corrected the last gate, and the two points %0a%3c become for them two entrances, all goodness without evil. Hence, it is said that %0a%3c THERE IS NO ACTION IN THEM, i.e., no analysis of good and evil, for they %0a%3c have already corrected everything. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, those who have not yet reached the end of correction are referred %0a%3c to as those who keep the Torah. There is action in them, for they have not yet %0a%3c corrected good and evil in everyone's Tree of Good and Evil— not everyone has %0a%3c realized in one's inner tree (in all of one's properties) what is good and what is %0a%3c evil with regard to the spiritual truth. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is therefore said that THOSE WHO KEEP THE TORAH SEEMINGLY %0a%3c CREATE IT THEMSELVES. As a result of man's effort to refrain from their %0a%3c use, all the distracting and impeding forces (thoughts and desires) of the point %0a%3c of Malchut become gates, all the locks become entrances, and all the entrances %0a%3c become chambers of wisdom filled with Ohr Hochma. %0a%3c %0a%3c It follows that all the wisdom and the entire Torah become revealed only %0a%3c through the efforts of those who keep the Torah. Hence, they SEEMINGLY %0a%3c CREATE IT THEMSELVES. The forces of good and evil are combined within %0a%3c them, and they become those who keep the Torah, for the Torah is revealed %0a%3c thanks to their inner work of separating and correcting good and evil. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such people are called "those who act," for they seemingly create the Torah %0a%3c by themselves. After all, without perceiving the Creator (The Torah, Light) as %0a%3c concealed, and then overcoming this concealment, thereby turning it into gates, %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The Two Points %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 279 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c The perfection of the Creator's actions lies in the fact that by creating man %0a%3c so paltry (with such insignificant egoistic desires, completely opposite to the %0a%3c Creator in his properties, and utterly powerless to change himself), the Creator %0a%3c gave man an opportunity to become like Him (in properties, greatness, and the %0a%3c sensation of creating himself), to create within and by himself all of the worlds %0a%3c and the Torah. By revealing the Light, it is as though man actually creates it. %0a%3c %0a%3c Thus, since these individuals reveal the Torah, they are regarded as its %0a%3c creators. The word is SEEMINGLY used to indicate that the Torah was created %0a%3c before the creation of our world (Talmud, Pesachim, 54:1), and of course, it is the %0a%3c work of the Creator Himself. Yet, without the good deeds of those who keep the %0a%3c Torah, it would not have been revealed to the world. Hence, they are regarded %0a%3c as the makers and creators of the Torah. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wisdom and the Torah are eternal; that is, they exist even after the %0a%3c end of correction, for fear of the Creator is needed even then. However, once %0a%3c the entire egoism is corrected, there is no place from which to take this fear, %0a%3c for the Tree of Good and Evil becomes only good, and can no longer furnish %0a%3c fear of the Creator. %0a%3c %0a%3c However, because they received fear in the past, they can continue using it %0a%3c in the present, after the end of correction, when there is nothing left to fear, as %0a%3c there are no restrictions in Malchut. And the only reason they can do so is that %0a%3c during the correction they worked on creating within them the sensation of the %0a%3c Creator's absolute rule and the eternity of the Torah. And since this fear is never- %0a%3c ending, the Creator's throne remains forever standing in their attainment. %0a
