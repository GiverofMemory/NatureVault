(1.)-THE ORIGIN OF THE MEDICAL ART. %0a%0aThe nature and multiplicity of the various remedies already %0adescribed or which still remain to be enlarged upon, compel %0ame to enter upon some further details with reference to the %0aart of medicine itself: aware as I am, that no one 1 has hitherto %0atreated of this subject in the Latin tongue, and that if all new %0aenterprises are difficult or of doubtful success, it must be one in %0aparticular which is so barren of all charms to recommend it, %0aand accompanied with such difficulties of illustration. It will %0anot improbably suggest itself, however, to those who are fami¬ %0aliar with this subject, to make enquiry how it is that in the %0apractice of medicine the use of simples has been abandoned, %0aso convenient as they are and so ready prepared to our hand: %0aand they will be inclined to feel equal surprise and indignation %0awhen they are informed that no known art, lucrative as this is %0abeyond all the rest, has been more fluctuating, or subjected to %0amore frequent variations. %0a%0aCommencing by ranking its inventors in the number of the %0agods, 2 and consecrating for them a place in heaven, the art of me¬ %0adicine, at the present day even, teaches us in numerous instances %0ato have recourse to the oracles for aid. In more recent times %0aagain, the same art has augmented its celebrity', at the cost perhaps %0aof being charged with criminality, by devising the fable that %0aJUsculapius was struck by lightning for presuming to raise Tyn- %0adareus 3 to life. And this example notwithstanding, it has not %0ahesitated to relate how that others, through its agency, have %0asince been restored to life. Already enjoying celebrity in the days %0a%0a1 He must surely have forgotton Celsus ; unless, indeed, Pliny was un¬ %0aacquainted with his treatise “ De Medicina.” %0a%0a2 Apollo and JEsculapius, Agenor, Hercules, Chiron, and others. %0a%0a3 The husband of Leda, and the father of Castor, Timandra, Clytaem- %0anestra, and Phiionoe. Hippolytus also was fabled to have been raised from %0athe dead by JEsculapius. %0a%0a%0aCHRYSIPPITS. %0a%0a%0a371 %0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0aof the Trojan War, its traditions from that period have ac¬ %0aquired an additional degree of certainty; although in those %0atimes, we may remark, the healing art confined itself solely to %0athe treatment of wounds. %0a%0aCHAP. 2.—PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO HIPPOCRATES. DATE OF THE %0a%0aORIGIN OF CLINICAL PRACTICE AND OF THAT OF IATRALIPTICS. %0a%0aIts succeeding history, a fact that is truly marvellous, re¬ %0amains enveloped in the densest night, down to the time of %0athe Peloponnesian War ; 4 at which period it was restored to %0alight by the agency of Hippocrates, a native of Cos, an island %0aflourishing and powerful in the highest degree, and consecrated %0ato iEsculapius. It being the practice for persons tvho had re¬ %0acovered from a disease to describe in the temple of that god the %0aremedies to which they had owed their restoration to health, %0athat others might derive benefit therefrom in a similar emer¬ %0agency ; Hippocrates, it is said, copied out these prescriptions, %0aand, as our fellow-countryman Varro will have it, after burn¬ %0aing the temple to the ground, 4 * instituted that branch of medi¬ %0acal practice which is known as “Clinics.” 5 There was no %0alimit after this to the profits derived from the practice of medi¬ %0acine ; for Prodicus, 6 a native of Selymbria, one of his disciples, %0afounded the branch of it known as “ Iatraliptics,” 7 and so dis¬ %0acovered a means of enriching the very anointers even and the %0acommonest drudges 8 employed by the physicians. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. —-PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO CHRT8IPPUS AND ERASIS- %0aTltATUS. %0a%0aIn the rules laid down by these professors, changes were %0aeffected by Ckrysippus with a vast parade of words, and, after %0a%0a4 Hippocrates is generally supposed to have been born b.c. 460. %0a%0a4 * In order to destroy the medical books and prescriptions there.

Prodicus of Se- %0alymbria does not appear to be known. %0a%0a7 “Healing by ointments,” or, as we should call it at the present day, %0a%0a“The Friction cure.” “ “ Mediastiuis.” ' %0a%0a%0a372 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HI9T0ET.

THE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT HAVE %0a%0aBEEN MADE IN THE SYSTEM OF MEDICINE. %0a%0aThese several schools of medicine, long at variance among %0athemselves, were all of them condemned by Herophilus, 12 who %0aregulated the arterial pulsation according to the musical 13 %0ascale, correspondingly with the age of the patient. In suc¬ %0aceeding years again, the theories of this sect were abandoned, %0ait being found that to belong to it necessitated an acquaintance %0awith literature. Changes, too, were effected in the school, of %0awhich, as already 13 * stated, Asclepiades had become the founder. %0aHis disciple, Themison, 14 who at first in his writings implicitly %0afollowed him, soon afterwards, in compliance with the growing %0adegeneracy of the age, went so far as to modify his own me¬ %0athods of treatment; which, in their turn, were entirely dis¬ %0aplaced, with the authorization of the late Emperor Augustus, %0aby Antonius Musa, 15 a physician who had rescued that prince %0a%0a9 Pythias, the daughter of Aristotle, was his stepmother, and adopted %0ahim. His mother’s name was Cretoxena. %0a%0a10 Or “ Sect of Experimentalists.” They based their practice upon ex¬ %0aperience derived from the observation of facts. The word “ Empiric ” is %0aused only in a bad sense at the present day.

As for Q. Stertinius, he thought that he conferred %0aan obligation upon the emperors in being content with five %0ahundred thousand 16 sesterces per annum ; and indeed he proved, %0aby an enumeration of the several houses, that a city practice %0awould bring him in a yearly income of not less than six hun¬ %0adred thousand sesterces. %0a%0aFully equal to this was the sum lavished upon his brother %0aby Claudius Caesar ; and the two brothers, although they had %0adrawn largely upon their fortunes in beautifying the public %0abuildings at Neapolis, left to their heirs no less than thirty %0amillions of sesterces ! 17 such an estate as no physician but Ar- %0aruntius had till then possessed. %0a%0aNext in succession arose Yettius Yalens, rendered so noto¬ %0arious by his adulterous connection 18 with Messalina, the wife %0aot Claudius Caesar, and equally celebrated as a professor of %0aeloquence. When established in public favour, he became the %0afounder of a new sect; %0a%0a__ It was in the same age, too, during the reign of the Emperor %0aNero, that the destinies of the medical art passed into the %0ahands of Thessalus, 19 a man who swept away all the precepts %0aof his predecessors, and declaimed with a sort of frenzy against %0athe physicians of every age; but with what discretion and %0ain what spirit, we may abundantly conclude from a single trait %0apresented by his character—upon his tomb, which is still %0ato be seen on the Appian Way, he had his name inscribed as %0athe “ Iatronices ’’—the “ Conqueror of the Physicians.” No %0astage-player, no driver of a three-horse chariot, had a greater %0athrong attending him when he appeared in public: but he %0awas at last eclipsed in credit by Crinas, a native of Massilia, %0awho, to wear an appearance of greater discreetness and more %0adevoutness, united in himself the pursuit of two sciences, and %0a%0a%0a16 Rather more than £4400. 17 More than £265,000. %0a%0a16 For which he was put to death a.d. 48. %0a%0a19 A native of Tralles in Lydia, and the son of a weaver there. Galen %0amentions him in terras of contempt and ridicule. %0a%0a%0a/ %0a%0a%0a374 %0a%0a%0aPLINT’s NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX %0a%0a%0aprescribed diets to his patients in accordance with the move¬ %0aments of the heavenly bodies, as indicated by the almanacks %0aof the mathematicians, taking observations himself of the %0avarious times and seasons. It was but recently that he died, %0aleaving ten millions of sesterces, after having expended hardly %0aa less sum upon building the walls of his native place and %0aof other towns. %0a%0aIt was while these men were ruling our destinies, that %0aall at once, Charmis, a native also of Massilia, took 20 the %0aCity by surprise. Not content with condemning the practice %0aof preceding physicians, he proscribed the use of warm baths %0aas well, and persuaded people, in the very depth of winter %0aeven, to immerse themselves in cold water. His patients %0ahe used to plunge into large vessels filled with cold water, %0aand it was a common thing to see aged men of consular %0arank make it a matter of parade to freeze themselves; a %0amethod of treatment, in favour of which Annaeus 21 Seneca gives %0ahis personal testimony, in writings still extant. %0a%0aThere can be no doubt whatever, that all these men, in the %0apursuit of celebrity by the introduction of some novelty or other, %0amade purchase of it at the downright expense of human life. %0aHence those woeful discussions, those consultations at the bed¬ %0aside of the patient, where no one thinks fit to be of the same %0aopinion as another, lest he may have the appearance of being %0asubordinate to another; hence, too, that ominous inscription %0ato be read upon a tomb, “ It was the multitude of physicians %0athat killed me.” 22 %0a%0aThe medical art, so often modified and renewed as it has %0abeen, is still on the change from day to day, and still are we %0aimpelled onwards by the puffs 23 which emanate from the in¬ %0agenuity of the Greeks. It is quite evident too, that every %0aone among them that finds himself skilled in the art of speech, %0amay forthwith create himself the arbiter of our life and death: %0aas though, forsooth, there were not thousands 24 of nations who %0a%0a20 “Invasit.” %0a%0a21 Ep. 53 and 83. His “ adstipulatio ” is of a very equivocal character, %0ahowever. %0a%0an “ Turba medicorum perii.” This is supposed to be borrowed from a %0aline of Menander— %0a%0anoXXwv iaTfiwv tioodoQ n’ andtXtatv. %0a%0aM “Flatu.” %0a%0a34 Herodotus states this with reference to the Babylonians ; Strabo, the %0a%0a%0aChap. 7.] OPINIONS ON THE ANCIENT PHYSICIANS. 37.3 %0a%0alire without any physicians at all, though not, for all that, %0awithout the aid of medicine. Such, for instance, was the Ho- %0aman 25 people, for a period of more than six hundred years ; a %0apeople, too, which has never shown itself slow to adopt all %0auseful arts, and which even welcomed the medical art with %0aavidity, until, after a fair experience of it, there was found %0agood reason to condemn it. %0a%0aCHAP. 6.—WHO FIRST PRACTISED AS A PHYSICIAN AT ROME, AND %0aAT WHAT PERIOD. %0a%0aAnd, indeed, it appears to me not amiss to take the present %0aopportunity of reviewing some remarkable facts in the days of %0aour forefathers connected with this subject. Cassius Hemina, 26 %0aone of our most ancient writers, says that the first physician %0athat visited Rome was Archagathus, the son of Lysanias, who %0acame over from Peloponnesus, in the year of the City 535, L. %0aJEmilius and M. Livius being consuls. He states also, that the %0aright of free citizenship 27 was granted him, and that he had a %0ashop 28 provided for his practice at the public expense in the %0aAcilian Cross-way ; 29 that from his practice he received the %0aname of “ Vulnerarius ;” 80 that on his arrival he was greatly %0awelcomed at first, but that soon afterwards, from the cruelty %0adisplayed by him in cutting and searing his patients, he ac¬ %0aquired the new name of “ Carnifex,” 31 and brought his art and %0aphysicians in general into considerable disrepute. %0a%0aThat such was the fact, we may readily understand from the %0awords of M. Cato, a man whose authority stands so high of %0aitself, that but little weight is added to it by the triumph 32 %0awhich he gained, and the Censorship which he held. I shall, %0atherefore, give his own words in reference to this subject. %0a%0aCHAP. 7.—THE OPINIONS ENTERTAINED BY THE ROMANS ON THE %0a* ANCIENT PHYSICIANS. %0a%0a“ Concerning those Greeks, son Marcus, I will speak to you %0a%0aBastitani, a people of Spain; and Eusebius, the more ancient inhabitants %0aof Spain. « See B. xx. c. 33. %0a%0a26 See end of B. xii. 27 “Jus Quiritium.” %0a%0a29 “Tabernam.” A surgery, in fact, the same as the “ iatreion’’ of the %0aGreeks. %0a%0a29 Or “ carrefour ”—“ compitum.’’ The Acilian Gens pretended to be %0aunder the especial tutelage of the gods of medicine. %0a%0a30 The “ Wound-curer,’’ from “vulnus,” a wound. %0a%0a31 “Executioner,” or “hangman.” 32 For his conquests in Spain. %0a%0a%0a376 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0amore at length on the befitting occasion. I will show you the %0aresults of my own experience at Athens, and that, while it is a %0agood plan to dip into their literature, 33 it is not worth while to %0amake a thorough acquaintance with it. They are a most iniqui¬ %0atous and intractable race, and you may take my word as the word %0aof a prophet, when I tell you, that whenever that nation shall %0abestow itsliterature upon Rome it will mar everything; and that %0aall the sooner, if it sends its physicians among us. They have %0aconspired among themselves to murder all' barbarians with their %0amedicine; a profession which they exercise for lucre, in order %0athat they may win our confidence, 34 and dispatch us all the %0amore easily. They are in the common habit, too, of calling us %0abarbarians, and stigmatize us beyond all other nations, by %0agiving us the abominable appellation of Opici. 35 I forbid you %0ato have anything to do with physicians.” %0a%0aCHAP. 8.—EVILS ATTENDANT UPON THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%0aCato, who wrote to this effect, died in his eighty-fifth year, %0ain the year of the City 605 ; so that no one is to suppose that %0ahe had not sufficient time to form his experience, either with %0areference to the duration of the republic, or the length of his %0aown life. Well then—are we to conclude that he has stamped %0awith condemnation a thing that in itself is most useful ? Tar %0afrom it, by Hercules ! for he subjoins an account of the medical %0aprescriptions, by the aid of which he had ensured to himself %0aand to his wife a ripe old age; prescriptions 36 upon which we are %0anow about to enlarge. He asserts also that he has a book of %0arecipes in his possession, by the aid of which he treats the %0amaladies of his son, his servants, and his friends; a book from %0awhich we have extracted the various prescriptions according to %0athe several maladies for which they are employed. %0a%0aIt was not the thing itself that the ancients condemned, but %0ait was the art as then practised, and they were shocked, more %0aparticularly, that man should pay so dear for the enjoyment of %0alife. For this reason it was, they say, that the Temple of %0a%0a33 “ Illorum literas inspicere.” %0a%0a34 On the principle that that which costs money must be worth having. %0a%0a35 The Opici or Osci were an ancient tribe of Italy, settled in Campania, %0aLatiura, and Samnium. From their uncivilized habits the name was long %0aused as a reproachful epithet, equivalent to our words “ bumpkin,” “clod¬ %0ahopper,” or “ chawbacon.” %0a%0a36 Marked by their supereminent absurdity, as Fee remarks. %0a%0a%0a377 %0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] EVILS FROM THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%0a.ZEsculapius, even after he was received as a divinity, was built %0awithout the City, and afterwards on an island ; 37 for this rea¬ %0ason, too, it was, that when, long after the time of Cato, the %0aGreeks were expelled from Italy, the physicians were not 38 %0aexempted from the decree. And here I will 39 improve upon %0athe foresight displayed by them. Medicine is the- only one of %0athe arts of Greece, that, lucrative as it is, the Roman gravity %0ahas hitherto refused to cultivate. It is but very few of our %0afellow-citizens that have even attempted it, and so soon as ever %0athey have done so, they have become deserters to the Greeks %0aforthwith. 40 Nay, even more than this, if they attempt to treat %0aof it in any other language than Greek, they are sure to lose %0aall credit, with the most ignorant even, and those who do not %0aunderstand a word of Greek; there being all the less confidence %0afelt by our people in that which so nearly concerns their wel¬ %0afare, if it happens to be intelligible to them. In fact, this is %0athe only one of all the arts, by Hercules! in which the moment %0aa man declares 41 himself to be an adept, he is at once believed, %0athere being at the same time no imposture, the results of which %0aare more fraught with peril. To all this, however, we give %0ano attention, so seductive is the sweet influence of the hope %0aentertained of his ultimate recovery by each. %0a%0aAnd then besides, there is no law in existence whereby %0ato punish the ignorance of physicians, no instance before us %0aof capital punishment inflicted. It is at the expense of our %0aperils that they learn, and they experimentalize by putting us %0ato death, a physician being the only person that can kill an¬ %0aother with sovereign impunity. Nay, even more than this, all %0athe blame is thrown upon the sick man only; he is accused of %0adisobedience forthwith, and it is the person who is dead and %0agone that is put upon his trial. It is the usage at Rome for %0athe decuries 42 to pass examination under the censorship of the %0a%0a37 Formed by the river Tiber. See the Qusest. Rom. of Plutarch, ou %0athis subject. %0a%0a38 We have adopted Sillig’s suggestion, and read “nec” for 44 et” here. %0aThe meaning, however, is very doubtful. %0a%0a39 “ Augebo providentiam illorura.” The meaning of this passage also %0ais doubtful. %0a%0a40 By adopting that language instead of the Latin; Sextius Niger, for in¬ %0astance. %0a%0a41 Diplomas seem to have been less cared for in those times than at the %0apresent day even, when quackery has so free a range. %0a%0a42 See B. iii. c. 26, and B. xxxiii. cc. 7, 8. %0a%0a%0a378 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Rook XXIX. %0a%0a%0aemperor, and for inquisitions to be made at our party-walls 45 %0aeven: persons who are to sit in judgment on our monetary %0amatters are sent for to Gades 44 and the very Pillars of Hercules; %0awhile a question of exile is never entertained without a panel %0aof forty-five men selected for the purpose. 4j Put when it is %0athe judge’s own life that is at stake, who are the persons that %0aare to hold council upon it, but those who the very next moment %0aare about to take it! %0a%0aAnd yet so it is, that we only meet with our deserts, no %0aone of us feeling the least anxiety to know what is necessary %0afor his own welfare. We walk 46 with the feet of other people, %0awe see with the eyes of other people, trusting to the memory of %0aothers we salute one another, and it is by the aid of others that %0awe live. The most precious objects of existence, and the chief %0asupports 47 of life, are entirely lost to us, and we have nothing %0aleft but our pleasures to call our own. I will not leave Cato %0aexposed to the hatred of a profession so ambitious as this, nor %0ayet that senate which judged as he did, but at the same time %0aI will pursue my object without wresting to my purpose the %0acrimes practised by its adepts, as some might naturally expect. %0aFor what profession has there been more fruitful in poisonings, %0aor from which there have emanated more frauds upon wills ? %0aAnd then, too, what adulteries have been committed, in the %0avery houses of our princes even! the intrigue of Eudemus, 48 %0afor example, with Livia, the wife of Drusus Caesar, and that of %0aYalens with the royal lady previously mentioned. 49 Let us %0anot impute these evils, I say, to the art, but to the men who %0apractise it; for Cato, I verily believe, as little apprehended %0a%0a%0a« «Inquisitio per parietes.” The reading is doubtful, but he not im¬ %0aprobably alludes to the employment of spies. %0a%0a« Hardouin thinks that he alludes to Cornelius Balbus here, a native ot %0aGades. See B. v. c. 5, and B. vii. 44. , ,. . . %0a%0a45 “ Electis viris datur tabula.” He alludes to the three tablets de¬ %0alivered to the Judices, one of which had inscribed on it “ Acquitted,” an¬ %0aother “Not proven,” and a third “ Guilty ”— Absolvatur , Non liquet , and %0a%0aCondem-no. ^ caste th in the Romans’ teeth, their Lecticarii, Anaq- %0a%0anostee, and Nomenclatores.’’—Holland. Letter-bearers, readers, and promp¬ %0aters as to the names of the persons addressed. %0a%0a17 He alludes to the resources of medicine. %0a%0a18 A physician at Rome, who was afterwards put to the torture for tins %0acrime. Livia was the daughter of Drusus Nero, the brother of Tiberius. %0a%0a49 Messalina, mentioned in c. 5 of this Rook. %0a%0a%0a379 %0a%0a%0aChap 8.] EVILS FROM THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%0asuch practices as these in the City, as he did the presence of %0aroyal ladies 80 there. %0a%0aI ■vnll not accuse the medical art of the avarice even of its %0aprofessors, the rapacious bargains made with their patients while %0atheir fate is trembling in the balance, the tariffs framed upon %0atheir agonies, the monies taken as earnest for the dispatching %0aof patients, or the mysterious secrets of the craft. I will not %0amention how that cataract must be couched 51 only, in the eye, %0ain preference to extracting it at once—practices, all of them, %0awhich have resulted in one very great advantage, by alluring %0ahither such a multitude of adventurers; it being no mo¬ %0aderation on their part, but the rivalry existing between such %0anumbers of practitioners, that keeps their charges within mo¬ %0aderation. It is a well-known fact that Charmis, the phy¬ %0asician 82 already mentioned, made a bargain with a patient of %0ahis in the provinces, that he should have two hundred thousand %0asesterces for the cure; that the Emperor Claudius extorted %0afrom Alcon, the surgeon, 83 ten millions of sesterces by way of %0atine; and that the same man, after being recalled from his %0aexile in Gaul, acquired a sum equally large in the course of a %0afew years. %0a%0aThese are faults, however, which must be imputed to in¬ %0adividuals only; and it is not my intention to waste reproof %0aupon the dregs of the medical profession, or to call attention to %0athe ignorance , displayed by that crew, 54 the violation of all %0aregimen in their treatment of disease, the evasions practised in %0athe use of warm baths, the strict diet they imperiously pre¬ %0ascribe, the food that is crammed into these same patients, %0aexhausted as they are, several times a day; together with a %0athousand other methods of showing how quick they are to %0achange their mind, their precepts for the regulation of the %0akitchen, and their recipes for the composition of unguents, %0ait being one grand object with them to lose sight of none %0aof the usual incitements to sensuality. The importation of %0aforeign merchandize, and the introduction of tariffs settled by %0aforeigners, 85 would have been highly displeasing to our ances- %0a%0a50 Nothing could possibly be more remote from bis republican notious, %0athan “ regiuse ” at Rome. %0a%0a81 “Emovendam.” In order that a future job may be ensured. %0a%0a82 Inc. 5 of this Book. 53 “ Vulnerum medico.” %0a%0a“ “.Ejus tuibae.” 65 See B. xxiv. c. 1. %0a%0a%0a3B0 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0ators, I can readily imagine; but it was not these inconveni- %0aences that Cato had in view, when he spoke thus strongly in %0acondemnation of the medical art. %0a%0a“Theriace” 56 is the name given to a preparation devised by %0aluxury; a composition formed of six hundred 51 different in¬ %0agredients ; and this while Nature has bestowed upon us such %0anumbers of remedies, each of which would have fully answered %0athe purpose employed by itself! The Mithridatic 58 antidote %0ais composed of four and fifty ingredients, none of which are %0aused in exactly the same proportion, and the quantity pre¬ %0ascribed is in some cases so small as the sixtieth part of one %0adenarius! Which of the gods, pray, can have instructed man %0ain such trickery as this, a height to which the mere subtlety %0aof human invention could surely never have reached? It %0aclearly must emanate from a vain ostentation of scientific skill, %0aand must be set down as a monstrous system of puffing off the %0amedical art. %0a%0aAnd yet, after all, the physicians themselves do not under¬ %0astand this branch of their profession; and I have ascertained %0athat it is a common thing for them to put mineral vermilion" %0ain their medicines, a rank poison, as I shall have occasion 60 to %0ashow when I come to speak of the pigments, in place of Indian %0acinnabar, and all because they mistake the name of the one %0adrug for that of the other! These, however, are errors which %0aonly concern the health of individuals, while it is the practices %0awhich Cato foresaw and dreaded, less dangerous in themselves %0aand little regarded, practices, in fact, which the leading men %0ain the art do not hesitate to avow, that have wrought 61 the %0acorruption of the manners of our empire. %0a%0aThe practices I allude to are those to which, while enjoying %0arobust health, we submit: such, for instance, as rubbing the body %0awith wax and oil, 63 a preparation for a wrestling match, by %0arights, but which, these men pretend, was invented as a preser¬ %0avative of health; the use of hot baths, which are necessary, %0a%0a56 The origin of our word “ treacle.” See B. xx. c. 100, and Note 97. %0a%0a37 Used as a round number, like our expression “ ten thousand.” %0a%0a5S See B. xxiii. c. 77, and B. xxv. c. 26. %0a%0a59 “ Minium.” This red lead had the name of “ cinnabaris nativa,” %0awhence the error. 60 In B. xxxiii. c. 38. %0a%0a61 As tending to effeminacy, or undermining the constitution. %0a%0a42 See B. xxviii. c. 13. %0a%0a%0a%0a381 %0a%0a%0aOhap. 9.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOOL. %0a%0athey have persuaded us, for the proper digestion of the food, %0abaths which no one ever leaves without being all the weaker %0afor it, and from which the more submissive of their patients %0aare only carried to the tomb; potions taken fasting ; vomits to %0aclear the stomach, and then a series of fresh drenchiDgs with %0adrink; emasculation, self-inflicted by the use of pitch-plasters %0aas depilatories ; the public exposure, too, of even the most de¬ %0alicate parts of the female body for the prosecution of these %0apractices. Most assuredly so it is, the contagion which has %0aseized upon the public morals, has had no more fertile source %0athan the medical art, and it continues, day by day even, to %0ajustify the claims of Cato to be considered a prophet and an %0aoracle of wisdom, in that assertion of his, that it is quite suffi¬ %0acient to dip into the records of Greek genius, without becoming %0atborougidy acquainted with them. %0a%0aSuch then is what may be said in justification of the senate %0aand of the ltoman people, during that period of six hundred %0ayears in which they manifested such repugnance to an art, by %0athe most insidious terms of which, good men are made to lend %0atheir credit and authority to the very worst, and so strongly %0aentered their protest against the silly persuasions entertained by %0athose, who fancy that nothing can benefit them but what is %0acoupled with high price. * %0a%0aI entertain no doubt, too, that there will be found some to ex¬ %0apress their disgust at the particulars which I am about to give, in %0arelation to animals: and yet Virgil himself has not disdained %0a—when, too, there was no necessity for his doing so—to speak %0aof ants and weevils, %0a%0a“ And nests by beetles made that shun the light.” 63 %0a%0aHomer, 61 too, amid his description of the battles of the gods, %0ahas not disdained to remark upon the voracity of the common %0aHy; nor has Vature, she who engender^, man, thought it beneath %0aher to engender these insects as well. Let each then make it %0ahis care, not so much to regard the thing itself, as to rightly %0aappreciate in each case the cause and its effects. %0a%0aCHAP. 9. THIRTY-FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOOL. %0a%0aI shall begin then with some remedies that are well known, %0a%0an “ Lucifugis congesta cubilia blattis.” Georg I. 184, IV. 243. %0a%0a64 11. xvii. 570, et seq. %0a%0a%0a382 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0athose namely, which are derived from wool and from the eggs of %0abirds, thus giving due honour to those substances which hold %0athe principal place in the estimation of mankind; though at %0athe same time I shall be necessitated to speak of some others out %0aof their proper place, according as occasion may offer. I should %0anot have been at a loss for high-flown language with which to %0agrace my narrative, had I made it my design to regard any¬ %0athing else than what, as being strictly trustworthy, 65 becomes %0amy work : for among the very first remedies mentioned, we %0afind those said to be derived from the ashes and nest of the %0aphoenix, 66 as though, forsooth, its existence were a well ascer¬ %0atained fact, and not altogether a fable. And then besides, it %0awould be a mere mockery to describe remedies that can only %0areturn to us once in a thousand years. %0a%0a(2.) The ancient Romans attributed to wool a degree of reli¬ %0agious importance even, and it was in this spirit that they enjoined %0athat the bride should touch the door-posts of her husband’s %0ahouse with wool. In addition to dress and protection from the %0acold, wool, in an unwashed state, used in combination with oil, %0aand wine or vinegar, supplies us with numerous remedies, accord¬ %0aing as we stand in need of an emollient or an excitant, an astrin¬ %0agent or a laxative. "Wetted from time to time with these liquids, %0agreasy wool is applied to sprained limbs, and to sinews that are %0asuffering from pain. In the case of sprains, some persons are %0ain the habit of adding salt, while others, again, apply pounded %0arue and grease, in wool : the same, too, in the case of con¬ %0atusions or tumours. Wool will improve the breath, it is said, %0aif the teeth and gums are rubbed with it, mixed with honey; %0ait is very good, too, for phrenitis, 67 used as a fumigation. To %0aarrest bleeding at the nose, wool is introduced into the nostrils %0awith oil of roses; or it is used in another manner, the ears %0abeing well plugged with it. In the case of inveterate ulcers it is %0aapplied topically with honey : soaked in wine or vinegar, or %0ain cold water and oil, and then squeezed out, it is used for %0athe cure of wounds. %0a%0aRams’ wool, washed in cold water, and steeped in oil, is %0aused for female complaints, and to allay inflammations of the %0auterus. Procidence of the uterus is reduced by using this wool %0a%0a65 He certainly does not always keep this object in view. %0a%0a66 See B. x. c. 2, and B. xii. c. 42. %0a%0a67 A form of fever, Littre remarks, that is known by the moderns as %0a“ pseudo-continuous.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 10.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOOL-GREASE. 383 %0a%0ain the form of a fumigation. Greasy wool, used as a plaster %0aand as a pessary, brings away the dead foetus, and arrests %0auterine discharges. Bites inflicted by a mad dog are plugged %0awith unwashed wool, the application being removed at the end %0aof seven days. Applied with cold water, it is a cure for %0aagnails: steeped in a mixture of boiling nitre, sulphur, oil, %0av?negar, and tar, and applied twice a day, as warm as possible, %0ait allays pains in the loins. By making ligatures with un¬ %0awashed rams’ wool about the extremities of the limbs, bleed¬ %0aing is effectually stopped. ' %0a%0aIn all cases, the wool most esteemed is that from the neck of %0athe animal; the best kinds of wool being those of Galatia, %0aTarentum, Attica, and Miletus. For excoriations, blows, %0abruises, contusions, crushes, galls, falls, pains in the head and %0aother parts, and for inflammation of the stomach, unwashed %0awool is applied, with a mixture of vinegar and oil of roses. %0aReduced to ashes, it is applied to contusions, wounds, and %0aburns, and forms an ingredient in ophthalmic compositions. It %0ais employed, also, for fistulas and suppurations of the ears. %0aFor this last purpose, some persons take the wool as it is shorn, %0awhile others pluck it from the fleece; they then cut off the %0aends of it, and after drying and carding it, lay it in pots of %0aunbaked earth, steep it well in honey, and burn it. Others, %0aagain, arrange it in layers alternately with chips of torch- %0apine, 68 and, after sprinkling it with oil, set fire to it: they %0athen rub the ashes into small vessels with the hands, aDd let %0athem settle in water there. This operation is repeated and the %0awater changed several times, until at last the ashes are found %0ato be slightly astringent, without the slightest pungency; upon %0awhich, they are put by for use, being possessed of certain %0acaustic properties, 69 and extremely useful as a detergent for %0athe eyelids. %0a%0aCHAP. 10. “"THIRTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIYED FROM WOOL-GREASE. %0a%0aAnd not only this, but the filthy excretions even of sheep, %0athe sweat adhering to the wool of the flanks and of the %0aaxillary concavities—a substance known as “ oesypum ’' are %0a%0a6? “ Smectica ” is suggested by Gesner, Hist. Amm., as a better reading %0a%0a10 “ (Esypum ” is often mentioned by Ovid as a favourite cosmetic with %0athe Roman ladies. %0a%0a%0a384 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0aapplied to purposes almost innumerable; the grease produced %0aby the sheep of Attica being the most highly esteemed. There %0aare numerous ways of obtaining it, but the most approved %0amethod is to take the wool, fresh clipped from those parts of %0athe body, or else the sweat and grease collected from any part of %0athe fleece, and boil it gently in a copper vessel upon a slow fire: %0athis done, it is left to cool, and the fat which floats upon the %0asurface collected into an earthen vessel. The material originally %0aused is then subjected to another boiling, and the two results %0aare washed in cold water; after which, they are strained %0athrough a linen cloth and exposed to the sun till they become %0ableached and quite transparent, and are then put by in a pew¬ %0ater box for keeping. %0a%0aThe best proof of its genuineness is its retention of the %0astrong smell of the original grease, and its not melting when %0arubbed with water upon the hand, but turning white, like %0awhite-lead in appearance. This substance is extremely use¬ %0aful for inflammations of the eyes and indurations of the eye¬ %0alids. Some persons bake the wool in an earthen pot, until it %0ahas lost all its grease, and are of opinion that, prepared this %0away, it is a more useful remedy for excoriations and indurations %0aof the eyelids, for eruptions at the corners of the eyes, and for %0awatery eyes. And not only does this grease heal ulcerations %0aof the eyes, but, mixed with goose-grease, of the ears and %0agenerative organs as well; in combination also with melilote %0aand butter, it is a cure for inflammations of the uterus, and for %0aexcoriations of the rectum and condylomata. The other uses %0ato which it is applied, we shall detail on a more appropriate %0aoccasion. %0a%0aThe grease, too, of the wool about the tail is made up into %0apills, unmixed with any substance : these pills are dried and %0apulverized, being an excellent application for the teeth, when %0aloose even, and for the gums, when attacked by spreading ulcers %0aof a cancerous nature. Sheep’s wool, too, cleaned, is applied %0aby itself, or with the addition of sulphur, for dull, heavy pains, %0aand the ashes of it, burnt, are used for diseases of the genera¬ %0ative organs: indeed, this wool is possessed of such sovereign %0avirtues, that it is used as a covering for medicinal applications %0aeven. It is also an especial remedy for the sheep itself, when %0ait has lost its stomach, and refuses to feed ; for, upon plucking %0asome wool from the tail, and then tying the tail therewith, as %0a%0a%0aChap. 11.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM EGGS. 385 %0a%0atight as possible, the sheep will fall to feeding immediately. It %0ais said, however, that the part of the tail which lies beyond %0athe knot so made will quickly mortify and die. %0a%0aCHAP. 11. (3.)-TWENTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM EGGS. %0a%0aThere is a considerable affinity also between wool and eggs, %0awhich are applied together as a frontal to the forehead by way %0aof cure for defluxions of the eyes. Wool, however, is not %0arequired for this purpose to have been dressed with radicula, 11 %0athe only thing requisite to be combined with it being the %0awhite of an egg and powdered frankincense. The white of an %0aegg, also applied by itself, arrests defluxions of the eyes, and has %0aa cooling effect upon inflammations of those organs : some, how¬ %0aever, prefer mixing saffron with it, and employ it as an ingre¬ %0adient in eye-salves, in place of water. For ophthalmia in infants %0athere is hardly any remedy to be found, except white of egg %0amixed with fresh butter. Eggs beaten up with oil, are very %0asoothing for erysipelas, beet leaves being laid on the liniment. %0a%0aWhite of egg, mixed with pounded gum ammoniac, is used %0aas a bandoline for arranging the hairs of the eyelids ; and, in %0acombination with pine-nuts and a little honey, it forms a %0aliniment for the removal of pimples on the face. If the face %0ais well rubbed with it, it will never be sun-burnt. If, the %0amoment the flesh has been scalded, an egg is applied, no blis¬ %0aters will form : some persons, however, mix with it barley- %0ameal and a little salt. In cases of ulceration formed by burns, %0athere is nothing better than parched barley and hogs’ lard, %0amixed with the white of an egg. The same mixture is also %0aused as an application for diseases of the rectum, in infants %0aeven, and in cases, too, when there is procidence of those parts. %0aFor the cure of chaps upon the feet, white of eggs is boiled, %0awith two denarii of white lead, an equal quantity of litharge, %0aa little myrrh, and some wine. For the cure of erysipelas they %0ause the whites of three eggs with amylum: 72 it is said, too, %0athat white of egg has the effect of knitting wounds and of %0aexpelling urinary calculi. The yolk of eggs boiled hard, %0aapplied in woman’s milk with a little saffron and honey, has %0aa soothing effect upon pains in the eyes. The yolk is applied %0aalso to the eyes in wool, mixed with honied wine and oil of %0a%0a11 See B. xix. c. 1, B. xxiv. c 58, and B. xxv. c. 21. %0a%0a12 See B. xviii. c. 17. %0a%0aVOL. v. c C %0a%0a%0a386 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0aroses ; or else mixed with ground parsley-seed and polenta, and %0aapplied with honied wine. The yolk of a single egg, swallowed %0araw by itself without being allowed to touch the teeth, is %0aremarkably good for cough, defluxions of the chest, and irrita¬ %0ations of the fauces. It is used, too, both internally and ex¬ %0aternally, in a raw state, as a sovereign cure for the sting of the %0ahsemorrho'is ; 13 and it is highly beneficial for the kidneys, for %0airritations and ulcerations of the bladder, and for bloody expec¬ %0atorations. For dysentery, the yolks of five eggs are taken raw %0ain one semi-sextarius of wine, mixed with the ashes of the shells, %0apoppy-juice, and wine. %0a%0aFor cceliac fluxes, it is recommended to take the yolks of %0aeggs, with like proportions of pulpy raisins and pomegranate %0arind, in equal quantities, for three consecutive days; or else %0ato follow another method, and take the yolks of three eggs, %0awith three ounces of old bacon and honey, and three cyathi of %0aold wine; the whole being beaten up to the consistency of %0ahoney, and taken in water, when needed, in pieces the size of %0aa hazel nut. In some cases, too, the yolks of three eggs are %0afried in oil, the whole of the egg having been steeped a day %0apreviously in vinegar. It is in this way that eggs are used for %0athe treatment of spleen diseases; but for spitting of blood, they %0ashould be taken with three cyathi of must. Yolk of egg is used, %0atoo, for the cure of bruises of long standing, in combination %0awith bulbs and honey. Boiled and taken in wine, yolks of %0aeggs arrest menstruation : applied raw with oil or wine, they %0adispel inflations of the uterus. Mixed with goose-grease and %0aoil of roses, they are useful for crick in the neck; and they %0aare hardened over the fire, and applied warm, for the cure of %0amaladies of the rectum. For condylomata, eggs are used in %0acombination with oil of roses; and for the treatment of burns, %0athey are hardened in water, and set upon hot coals till the %0ashells are burnt, the yellow being used as a liniment with oil %0aof roses. %0a%0aEggs become entirely transformed into yolk, on being re¬ %0amoved after the hen has sat upon them for three days; in %0aw r hich state they are known by the name of “ sitista .” 71 The %0achicks that are found within the shell are used for strengthen- %0a%0a73 See B. xx. c. 23. %0a%0a74 Hermolaiis suggests “schista,” “divided,” and Dalechamps proposes %0a“synchyta,” “ mixed.” The reading is very doubtful. %0a%0a%0aChap. 11] %0a%0a%0aREMEDIES DEBITED FROM EGGS. %0a%0a%0a387 %0a%0a%0aing a disordered stomach, being eaten with half a nut-gall, %0aand no other food taken for the next two hours. They are %0agiven also for dysentery, boiled in the egg with one semi-sexta- %0ariuS of astringent wine, and an equal quantity of olive oil and %0apolenta. The pellicle that lines the shell is used, either raw %0aor boiled, for the.cure of cracked lips; and the shell itself, %0areduced to ashes, is taken in wine for discharges of blood : care %0amust be taken, however, to burn it without the pellicle. In %0athe same way, too, a dentifrice is prepared. The ashes of the %0ashell, applied topically with myrrh, arrest menstruation when %0ain excess. So remarkably strong is the shell of an egg, that %0aif it is set upright, no force or weight can break it, unless a %0aslight inclination be made to one side or other of the circum¬ %0aference. Eggs taken whole in wine, with rue, dill, and cum¬ %0amin, facilitate parturition. Used with oil and cedar-resin, %0athey remove itch and prurigo, and, applied in combination with %0acyclaminos , 75 they are remedial for running ulcers of the head. %0aTor purulent expectorations and spitting of blood, a raw egg %0ais taken, warmed with juice of cut-leek and an equal quantity %0aof Greek honey. For coughs, eggs are administered, boiled %0aand beaten up with honey, or else raw, with raisin wine and an %0aequal quantity of olive oil. For diseases of the male organs, %0aan injection is made, of an egg, three cyathi of raisin wine, %0aand half an ounce of amylum , 16 the mixture being used imme¬ %0adiately after the bath. Where injuries have been inflicted by %0aserpents, boiled eggs are used as a liniment, beaten up with %0anasturtium. %0a%0aIn what various ways eggs are used as food is well known %0ato all, passing downwards, however swollen the throat may %0abe, and warming the parts as they pass. Eggs, too, are the %0aonly diet which, while it affords nutriment in sickness, does %0anot load the stomach, possessing at the same moment all the %0aadvantages both of food and drink. We have already 77 stated, %0athat the shell of an egg becomes soft when steeped in vinegar : %0ait is by the aid of eggs thus prepared, and kneaded up with %0ameal, into bread, that patients suffering from the coeliac flux %0aare often restored to strength. Some, however, think it a better %0aplan to roast the eggs, when thus softened, in a shallow pan ; %0aa method, by the aid of which, they arrest not only looseness of. %0a%0a75 Or Sowbread. See B. xxv. c. 67. %0a%0a76 See B. xviii. c. 17. 77 In B. x. c. 80. %0a%0ac c 2 %0a%0a%0a388 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXJX %0a%0a%0athe bowels, but excessive menstruation as well. In cases, %0aagain, where the discharges are greatly in excess, eggs are %0ataken raw, with meal, in water. The yolks, too, are employed %0aalone, boiled hard in vinegar and roasted with ground pepper, %0awhen wanted to arrest diarrhoea. %0a%0aTor dysentery, there is a sovereign remedy, prepared in the %0afollowing manner: an egg is emptied into a new earthen vessel, %0awhich done, in order that all the proportions may be equal, %0afill the shell, first with honey, then with oil, and then with %0avinegar; beat them up together, and thoroughly incorporate %0athem : the better the quality of the several ingredients, the %0amore efficacious the mixture will be. Others, again, instead %0aof oil and vinegar, use the same proportions of red resin and %0awine. There is also another way of making up this prepara¬ %0ation : the proportion of oil, and of that only, remains the same, %0aand to it they add two sixtieth parts of a denarius of the %0avegetable which we have spoken of under the name of “rhus ,” 18 %0aand five oboli of honey. All these ingredients are boiled down %0atogether, and no food is eaten by the patient till the end of %0afour hours after taking the mixture. Many persons, too, have %0aa cure for griping pains in the bowels, by beating up two eggs %0awith four cloves of garlick, and administering them, warmed %0ain one semi-sextarius of wine. %0a%0aNot to omit anything in commendation of eggs, I would %0ahere add that glair of egg, mixed with quicklime, unites %0abroken 79 glass. Indeed, so great is the efficacy of the substance %0aof an egg, that wood dipped in it will not take fire, and cloth %0awith which it has come in contact will not ignite . 80 On this %0aoccasion, however, it is only of the eggs of poultry that I have %0abeen speaking, though those of the various other birds as well %0aare possessed of many useful properties, as I shall have to %0amention on the appropriate occasions. %0a%0aCHAP. 12. — SERPENTS* EGGS. %0a%0aIn addition to the above, there is another kind of egg , 81 held %0a%0a78 See B. xxiv. c. 54. %0a%0a79 This is the fact, and it is similarly used for mending china. White %0aof egg, mixed with whiskey or spirits of wine, will answer the purpose %0aequally well. %0a%0a80 Ajasson remarks that there is some slight truth in this assertion. %0a%0a81 Pliny alludes here to the beads or rings of glass which were used by %0athe Druids as charms to impose on the credulity of their devotees, under %0a%0a%0aChap. 12.] %0a%0a%0aSEHPEXTS’ EGGS. %0a%0a%0a389 %0a%0a%0ain high renown by the people of the Gallic provinces, but %0atotally omitted by the Greek writers. In summer 82 time, num¬ %0aberless snakes become artificially entwined together, and form %0arings around their bodies with the viscous slime which exudes %0afrom their mouths, and with the foam secreted by them : the %0aname given to this substance is “ anguinum .” 83 The Druids %0atell us, that the serpents eject these eggs into the air by their %0ahissing , 84 and that a person must be read)' to catch them in a %0acloak, so as not to let them touch the ground; they say also that he %0amust instantly take to flight on horseback, as the serpents will %0abe sure to pursue him, until some intervening river has placed %0aa barrier between them. The test of its genuineness, they say, %0ais its floating against the current of a stream, even though it %0abe set in gold. But, as it is the way with magicians to be %0adexterous and cunning in casting a veil about their frauds, they %0apretend that these eggs can only be taken on a certain day of %0athe moon; as though, forsooth, it depended entirely upon the %0ahuman will to make the moon and the serpents accord as to %0athe moment of this operation. %0a%0aI myself, however, have seen one of these eggs: it was %0around, and about as large as an apple of moderate size; the %0ashell 65 of it was formed of a cartilaginous substance, and it was %0asurrounded with numerous cupules, as it were, resembling %0athose upon the arms of the polypus : it is held in high estimation %0a%0atbe name of Glain naidr, or “ the Adder gem.” Mr. Luyd (in Rowland’s %0aMona Antiqua, p. 342) says that the genuine Ovum anguinum can be no %0aother than a shell of the kind called echinus marinus, and that Dr. Borlase %0aobserves that, instead of the natural anguinum , artificial rings of stone, %0aglass, and sometimes baked clay, were substituted as of equal validity. %0aThe belief in these charms very recently existed in Cornwall and Wales, if %0aindeed it does not at the present day. The subject is very fully discussed in %0aBrand’s Popular Antiquities, Vol. III. p. 286, et seq., and p. 369, et seq., %0aBohn's Edition. These gems and beads are not uncommonly found in tumuli %0aof the early British period. %0a%0a8 - A similar belief in its origin was prevalent in Cornwall and Wales, %0aand whoever found it was supposed to ensure success in all his undertakings. %0a%0a83 “The snake’s egg”— ovum being understood. %0a%0ael “ The vulgar opinion in Cornwall and most parts of Wales is that these %0aare produced through all Cornwall by snakes joining their heads together %0aand hissing, which forms a kind of bubble like a ring about the head of %0aone of them, which the rest, by continual hissing, blow on till it comes off %0aat the tail, when it immediately hardens and resembles a glass ring.”— %0aGough's Camden, Vol. II. p. 571, Ed. 1789. %0a%0a85 The shell of a sea urchin most probably.

The possession of it is marvellously vaunted %0aas ensuring success 86 in law-suits, and a favourable reception %0awith princes; a notion which has been so far belied, that a %0aKoman of equestrian rank, a native of the territory of the %0aVocontii , 87 who, during a trial, had one of these eggs in his %0abosom, was slain by the late Emperor Tiberius, and for uo %0aother reason, that I know of, but because he was in possession %0aof it. It is this entwining of serpents with one another, and %0athe fruitful results of this unison, that seem to me to have %0agiven rise to the usage among foreign nations, of surrounding %0athe caduceus 88 with representations of serpents, as so many %0asymbols of peace—it must be remembered, too, that on the %0acaduceus, serpents are never 89 represented as having crests. %0a%0aCHAP. 13 . —THE METHOD OF PREPARING COMMAGENUM. FODR %0aREMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. %0a%0aHaving to make mention, in the present Book, of the eggs %0aof the goose and the numerous uses to which they are applied, %0aas also of the bird itself, it is our duty to award the honour to %0aCommagene 90 of a most celebrated preparation there made. %0aThis composition is prepared from goose-grease, a substance %0aapplied to many other well-known uses as well; but in the %0acase of that which comes from Commagene, a part of Syria, the %0agrease is first incorporated with cinnamon, cassia , 91 white pep¬ %0aper, and the plant called “commagene ,” 92 and then placed in %0avessels and buried in the snow. The mixture has an agree¬ %0aable smell, and is found extremely useful for cold shiverings, %0aconvulsions, heavy or sudden pains, and all those affections, in %0afact, which are treated with the class of remedies known as %0a“ acopa ;” 93 being equally an unguent and a medicament. %0a%0aThere is another method, also, of preparing it in Syria: the %0afat of the bird is preserved in manner already 94 described, and %0a%0a86 See Note 82 above. %0a%0a87 A nation of Gaul.

There are nume¬ %0arous other remedies, also, derived from the goose, as well as %0afrom the raven a thing I am much surprised at, seeing that %0aboth the goose and the raven 99 are generally said to be in a %0adiseased state at the end of summer and the beginning of %0aautumn. %0a%0aCHAP. 14. (4.)—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE DOG. %0a%0aWe have already 1 spoken of the honours earned by the %0ageese, when the Gauls were detected in their attempt to scale %0athe Capitol. It is for a corresponding reason, also, that punish¬ %0ament is yearly inflicted upon the dogs, by crucifying them alive %0aupon a gibbet of elder, between the Temple of Juventas 2 and %0athat of Summanus . 3 %0a%0aIn reference to this last-mentioned animal, the usages of our %0aforefathers compel us to enter into some further details. They %0aconsidered the flesh of sucking whelps to be so pure a meat, %0athat they were in the habit of using them as victims even in %0atheir expiatory sacrifices. A young whelp, too, is sacrificed to %0aGenita Mana ; 4 and, at the repasts celebrated in honour of the %0agods, it is still the usage to set whelps’ flesh on table; at the %0ainaugural feasts, too, of the pontiffs, this dish was in com¬ %0amon use, as we learn from the Comedies 5 of Plautus. It is %0agenerally thought that for narcotic 6 poisons there is nothing %0abetter than dogs’ blood ; and it would appear that it was this %0aanimal that first taught man the use of emetics.

REMEDIES FOE INJURIES INFLICTED BY SERPENTS. %0a%0aREMEDIES DERIVED FROM MICE. %0a%0aWe will now resume the order originally proposed . 1 For %0astings inflicted by serpents fresh sheeps’-dung, boiled in wine, %0ais considered a very useful application: as also mice split %0aasunder and applied to the wound. Indeed, these last animals %0aare possessed of certain properties by no means to be despised, %0aat the ascension of the planets more particularly, as already” %0astated; the lobes increasing or decreasing in number, with the %0aage of the moon, as the case may be. The magicians have a %0astory that swine will follow any person who gives them a %0amouse’s liver to eat, enclosed in a fig: they say, too, that it %0ahas a similar effect upon man, but that the spell may be de¬ %0astroyed by swallowing a cyathus of oil. %0a%0aCHAP. 16.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE WEASEL. %0a%0aThere are two varieties of the weasel; the one, wild , 9 larger %0athan the other, and known to the Greeks as the “ ictis its %0agall is said to be very efficacious as an antidote to the sting of %0athe asp, but of a venomous nature in other respects. 9 * The %0aother kind , 10 which prowls about our houses, and is in the %0ahabit, Cicero tells us , 11 of removing its young ones, and %0achanging every day from place to place, is an enemy to ser¬ %0apents. The flesh of this last, preserved in salt, is given, in %0adoses of one denarius, in three cyathi of drink to persons who %0ahave been stung by serpents : or else the maw of the animal is %0astuffed with coriander seed and dried, to be taken for the same %0apurpose in wine. The young one of the weasel is still more %0aefficacious for these purposes. %0a%0aCHAP. 17.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM BUGS. %0a%0aThere are some things, of a most revolting nature, but which %0a%0a' Of remedies classified according to the different maladies. %0a%0a8 In B. xi. c. 76. 9 The ferret, most probably. %0a%0a9 * See c. 33 of this Book. 10 The common weasel. %0a%0a11 Probably in his work entitled “ Admiranda,” now lost. Holland says %0a“ some take these for our cats.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 17.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM BUGS. 393 %0a%0aare recommended by authors with such a degree of assurance, %0athat it would be improper to omit them, the more particularly %0aas it is to the sympathy or antipathy of objects that remedies %0aowe their existence. Thus the bug, for instance, a most filthy %0ainsect, and one the very name of which inspires us with loath¬ %0aing, is said to be a neutralizer of the venom of serpents, asps in %0aparticular, and to be a preservative against all kinds of poisons. %0aAs a proof of this, they tell us that the sting of an asp is never %0afatal to poultry, if they have eaten bugs that day; and that, %0aif such is the case, their flesh is remarkably beneficial to persons %0awho have been stung by serpents. Of the various recipes 12 %0agiven in reference to these insects, the least revolting are the %0aapplication of them externally to the wound, with the blood of %0aa tortoise ; the employment of them as a fumigation to make %0aleeches loose their hold; and the administering of them to ani¬ %0amals in drink when a leech has been accidentally swallowed. %0aSome persons, however, go so far as to crush bugs with salt %0aand woman’s milk, and anoint the eyes with the mixture ; in %0acombination, too, with honey and oil of roses, they use them %0aas an injection for the ears. Field-bugs, again, and those found %0aupon the mallow , 13 are burnt, and the ashes mixed with oil %0aof roses as an injection for the ears. %0a%0aAs to the other remedial virtues attributed to bugs, for the %0acure of vomiting, quartan fevers, and other diseases, although %0awe find recommendations given to swallow them in an egg, %0asome wax, or in a bean, I look upon them as utterly unfounded, %0aand not worthy of further notice. They are employed, how¬ %0aever, for the treatment of lethargy, and with some fair reason, %0aas they successfully neutralize the narcotic effects of the poison %0aof the asp : for this purpose seven of them are administered %0ain a cyathus of w r ater, but in the case of children only four. %0aIn cases, too, of strangury, they have been iujected into the %0aurinary channel : 14 so true it is that Nature, that universal %0aparent, has engendered nothing without some powerful reason %0aor other. In addition to these particulars, a couple of bugs, %0a%0a12 Guettard, a French commentator on Pliny, recommends bugs to be %0ataken internally for hysteria! %0a%0a13 Perhaps the Cimex pratensis is meant here. Neither this nor the %0aCimex juniperinus, the Cimex brassicae, or the Lygaeus hyoscami has the %0aoffensive smell of the house bug. %0a%0a14 An excellent method, Ajasson remarks, of adding to the tortures of %0athe patient. %0a%0a%0a394 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXTX. %0a%0a%0ait is said, attached to the left arm in some wool that has been %0astolen from the shepherds, will effectually cure nocturnal fevers; %0awhile those recurrent in the daytime may be treated with %0aequal success by enclosing the bugs in a piece of russet-coloured %0acloth. The scolopendra, on the other hand, is a great enemy %0ato these insects; used in the form of a fumigation, it kills %0athem. %0a%0aCHAP. 18.-PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE ASP. %0a%0aThe sting of the asp takes deadly effect by causing torpor %0aand drowsiness. Of all serpents, injuries inflicted by the asp %0aare the most incurable ; and their venom, if it comes in contact %0awith the blood or a recent wound, produces instantaneous death. %0aIf, on the other hand, it touches an old sore, its fatal effects %0aare not so immediate. Taken internally, in however large a %0aquantity, the venom is not injurious , 15 as it has no corrosive pro¬ %0aperties ; for which reason it is that the flesh of animals killed %0aby it may be eaten with impunity. %0a%0aI should hesitate in giving circulation to a prescription for %0ainjuries inflicted by the asp, were it not that M. Yarro, then %0ain the eighty-third year of his age, has left a statement to the %0aeffect that it is a most efficient remedy for wounds inflicted by %0athis reptile, for the person stung to drink his own urine. %0a%0aCHAP. 19. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE BASILISK. %0a%0aAs to the basilisk , 16 a creature which the very serpents fly %0afrom, which kills by its odour even, and which proves fatal to %0aman by only looking upon him, its blood has been marvel¬ %0alously extolled by the magicians . 17 This blood is thick and %0aadhesive, like pitch, which it resembles also in colour: dis¬ %0asolved in water, they say, it becomes of a brighter red than %0athat of cinnabar. They attribute to it also the property of %0aensuring success to petitions preferred to potentates, and to %0aprayers even offered to the gods; and they regard it as a %0aremedy for various diseases, and as an amulet preservative %0aagainst all noxious spells. Some give it the name of “ Saturn’s %0ablood.” %0a%0a15 This is the fact. 15 See B. viii. c. 33. %0a%0a17 The Magi of the East, probably. %0a%0a%0aCbap. 21.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM THE TIPER. 395 %0a%0aCHAP. 20.-RKME.DIES DERIVED FROM THE DRAGON. %0a%0aThe dragon 18 is a serpent destitute of venom. Its head, %0aplaced beneath the threshold of a door, the gods being duly- %0apropitiated by prayers, will ensure good fortune to the house, %0ait is said. Its eyes, dried and beaten up with honey, form a %0aliniment which is an effectual preservative against the terrors %0aof spectres by night, in the case of the most timorous even. %0aThe fat adhering to the heart, attached to the arm with a %0adeer’s sinews in the skin of a gazelle, will ensure success in %0alaw-suits, it is said; and the first joint of the vertebrae will %0asecure an easy access to persons high in office. The teeth, %0aattached to the body with a deer’s sinews in the skin of a roe¬ %0abuck, have the effect of rendering masters indulgent and poten¬ %0atates gracious, it is said. %0a%0aBut the most remarkable thing of all is a composition, by %0athe aid of which the lying magicians profess to render persons %0ainvincible. They take the tail and head of a dragon, the hairs %0aof a lion’s forehead with the marrow of that animal, the foam %0aof a horse that has won a race, and the claws of a dog’s feet: %0athese they tie up together in a deer’s skin, and fasten them %0aalternately with the sinews of a deer and a gazelle. It is, %0ahowever, no better worth our while to refute such pretensions %0aas these, than it would be to describe the alleged remedies for %0ainjuries inflicted by serpents, seeing that all these contrivances %0aare so many evil devices to poison 19 men’s morals. %0a%0aDragon’s fat will repel venomous creatures ; an effect which is %0aequally produced by burning the fat of the ichneumon . 20 They %0awill take to flight, also, at the approach of a person who has %0abeen rubbed with nettles bruised in vinegar. %0a%0aCHAP. 21.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VIPER. %0a%0aThe application of a viper’s head, even if it be not the one %0athat has inflicted the wound, is of infinite utility as a remedy". %0aIt is highly advantageous, too, to hold the viper that inflicted %0athe injury on the end of a stick, over the steam of boiling %0a%0a18 Some serpent of the boa species, probably. See B. viii. cc. 13, 14, %0a22. 41, and B. x. cc. 5, 92, 95, 96. %0a%0a18 By leading them to confound truth with fiction. %0a%0a28 See B. viii. c. 35. %0a%0a%0a396 %0a%0a%0aflint’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0awater, for it will quite undo 21 the mischief, they say. The %0aashes, also, of the viper, are considered very useful, employed as %0aa liniment for the wound. According to what Xigidius tells %0aus, serpents are compelled, by a sort of natural instinct, to %0areturn to the person who has been stung by them. The people %0aof Scythia split the viper’s head between the ears, in order to %0aextract a small stone , 22 which it swallows in its alarm, th**y %0asay : others, again, use the head entire. %0a%0aFrom the viper are prepared those tablets which are known %0aas “ theriaci ” 24 to the Greeks : for this purpose the animal is %0acut away three fingers’ length from both the head and the tail, %0aafter which the intestines are removed and the livid vein ad¬ %0ahering to the back-bone. The rest of the body is then boiled %0ain a shallow pan, in water seasoned with dill, and the bones are %0ataken out, and fine wheaten flour added; after which the %0apreparation is made up into tablets , 24 which are dried in the %0ashade and are employed as an ingredient in numerous medica¬ %0aments. I should remark, however, that this preparation, it %0awould appear, can only be made from the viper. Some per¬ %0asons, after cleansing the viper in manner above described, boil %0adown the fat, with one sextarius of olive oil, to one half. Of %0athis preparation, when needed, three drops are added to some %0aoil, with which mixture the body is rubbed, to repel the %0aapproach of all kinds of noxious animals. %0a%0aCHAP. 22 . —REMEDIES DERIVED PROM THE ofHER SERPENTS. %0a%0aIn addition to these particulars, it is a well-known fact that %0afor all injuries inflicted by serpents, and those even of an %0aotherwise incurable nature, it is an excellent remedy to apply %0athe entrails of the serpent itself to the wound ; as also, that %0apersons who have once swallowed a viper’s liver, boiled, will %0anever afterwards be attacked by serpents. The snake, too, %0ais not venomous, except, indeed, upon certain days of the %0amonth when it is irritated by the action of the moon: it is a %0avery useful plan to take it alive, and pound it in water, the %0awound inflicted by it being fomented with the preparation. %0aIndeed, it is generally supposed that this reptile is possessed of %0a%0a21 This is perhaps the meaning of “ praecanere.” Sillig suggests “re- %0acanere.” %0a%0a22 Which was said to act as an antidote to the poison, applied to the %0awound. %0a%0a23 “ Antidotes to serpents’poison.” 21 “Pastilli.” %0a%0a%0aChap. 23.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM TIIE SALAMANDER. 397 %0a%0anumerous other remedial properties, as we shall have occasion %0amore fully to mention from time to time: hence it is that the %0asnake is consecrated to JEsculapius . 25 As for Democritus, he %0ahas given some monstrous preparations from snakes, by the aid %0aof which the language of birds, he says, may be understood . 26 %0a%0aThe iEsculapian snake was first brought to Rome from %0aEpidaurus,*' but at the present day it is very commonly reared %0ain our houses 28 even ; so much so, indeed, that if the breed %0awere not kept down by the frequent conflagrations, it would %0abe impossible to make head against the rapid increase of them. %0aBut the most beautiful of all the snakes are those which are %0aof an amphibious nature. These snakes are known as %0a“ hydri ,” 29 or water-snakes: in virulence their venom is in¬ %0aferior to that of no other class of serpents, and their liver is %0apreserved as a remedy for the ill effects of their sting. %0a%0aA pounded scorpion neutralizes the venom of the spotted %0alizard . 30 From this last animal, too, there is a noxious preparation %0amade; for it has been found that wine in which it has been %0adrowned, covers the face of those who drink it with morphew. %0aHence it is that females, when jealous of a rival’s beauty, are %0ain the habit of stifling a spotted lizard in the unguents which %0athey use. In such a case, the proper remedy is yolk of egg, %0ahoney, and nitre. The gall of a spotted lizard, beaten up in %0awater, attracts weasels, they say. %0a%0aCHAP. 23.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM TOE SALAMANDER. %0a%0aBut of all venomous animals it is the salamander 31 that is %0a%0aM The god of Medicine. %0a%0a25 A favourite reverie with the learned of the East. Dupont de Ne¬ %0amours, Ajasson informs us, has left several Essays on this subject. %0a%0a21 In Peloponnesus, the principal seat of his worship. A very full %0aaccount of his introduction, under the form of a huge serpent, into the %0acity of Home, is given by Ovid, Met. B. xv. 1. 544, et seq. This took %0aplace b.c. 293. %0a%0a58 Among the snakes that are tamed, Ajasson enumerates the Coluber %0aflagelliformis of Dandin, or American coach-whip snake; the Coluber con¬ %0astructor of Linnseus, or Black snake; and the Coluber viridiflavus of %0aLacepede. The ADsculapian serpent is still found in Italy. %0a%0a29 Or “chersydri,” “amphibious.” %0a%0a30 Or “ starred lizard ”—“stellio.” In reality it is not poisonous. %0a%0aS1 See B. x. c. 86. Some kind of starred lizard, or an eft or newt per- %0a“ a ps, was thus called : but in most respects it appears to be entirely a %0afabulous animal. %0a%0a%0a398 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0aby far the most dangerous; for while other reptiles attack %0aindividuals only, and never kill many persons at a time—not %0ato mention the fact that after stinging a human being they %0aare said to die of remorse, and the earth refuses to harbour 31 %0athem—the salamander is able to destroy whole nations at once, %0aunless they take the proper precautions against it. For if this %0areptile happens to crawl up a tree, it infects all the fruit with %0aits poison, and kills those who eat thereof by the chilling pro¬ %0aperties of its venom, which in its effects is in no way different %0afrom aconite. Nay, even more than this, if it only touches %0awith its foot the wood upon which bread is baked, or if it %0ahappens to fall into a well, the same fatal effects will be sure %0ato ensue. The saliva, too, of this reptile, if it comes in contact %0awith any part of the body, the sole of the foot even, will %0acause the hair to fall off from the whole of the body. And yet %0athe salamander, highly venomous as it is, is eaten by certain %0aanimals, swine for example ; owing, no doubt, to that antipathy %0awhich prevails in the natural world. %0a%0aFrom what we find stated, it is most probable, that, next %0ato the animals which eat it, the best neutralizers of the poison %0aof this reptile, are, cantharides taken in drink, or a lizard eaten %0awith the food ; other antidotes we have already mentioned, or %0ashall notice in the appropriate place. As to what the ma¬ %0agicians 33 say, that it is proof against fire, being, as they tell us, %0athe only animal that has the property of extinguishing fire, if it %0ahad been true, it would have been made trial of at Rome long %0abefore this. Sextius says that the salamander, preserved in %0ahoney and taken with the food, after removing the intestines, %0ahead, and feet, acts as an aphrodisiac: he denies also that it %0ahas the property of extinguishing fire. %0a%0achap. 24. —remedies derived from birds for injuries ix- %0a%0aFLICTED BY SERPENTS. REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VCLTURE. %0a%0aAmong the birds that afford us remedies against serpents, it %0ais the vulture that occupies the highest rank; the black vulture, %0ait has been remarked, being less efficacious than the others. %0aThe smell of their feathers, burnt, will repel serpents, they say; %0aand it has been asserted that persons who carry the heart of %0a%0a32 See B ii. c. 63. %0a%0a33 He probably alludes to tbe Magi of Persia here, as most of the stories %0aabout tbe salamander appear to bear the aspect of an Eastern origin. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 25.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM POULTRY. 399 %0a%0athis bird about them will be safe, not only from serpents, but %0afrom wild beasts as well, and will have nothing to fear from %0athe attacks of robbers or from the wrath of kings. %0a%0aCHAP. 25.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM POULTRY. %0a%0aThe flesh of cocks and capons, applied warm the moment it %0ahas been plucked from the bones, neutralizes the venom of %0aserpents; and the brains, taken in wine, are productive of a %0asimilar effect. The people of Parthia, however, prefer apply¬ %0aing a hen’s brains to the wound. Poultry broth, too, is highly %0acelebrated as a cure, and is found marvellously useful in many %0aother cases. Panthers and lions will never touch persons who %0ahave been rubbed with it, more particularly if it has been %0aflavoured with garlic. The broth that is made of an old cock %0ais more relaxing to the bowels; it is very good also for chronic %0afevers, numbness of the limbs, cold shiverings and maladies of %0athe joints, pains also in the head, defluxions of the eyes, %0aflatulency, sickness at stomach, incipient tenesmus, liver %0acomplaints, diseases of the kidneys, affections of the bladder, %0aindigestion, and asthma. Hence there are several recipes for %0apreparing this broth ; it being most efficacious when boiled up %0awith sea-cabbage , 34 salted tunny , 35 capers, parsley, the plant %0amercurialis , 36 polypodium , 37 or dill. The best plan, however, %0ais to boil the cock or capon with the plants above-mentioned in %0athree congii of water, down to three semi-sextarii; after which %0ait should be left to cool in the open air, and given at the proper %0amoment, just after an emetic has been administered. %0a%0aAnd here I must not omit to mention one marvellous fact, %0aeven though it bears no reference to medicine: if the flesh of %0apoultry is mingled with gold 38 in a state of fusion, it will %0aabsorb the metal and consume it, thus showing that it acts %0aas a poison upon gold. If young twigs are made up into a %0acollar and put round a cock’s neck, it will never crow. %0a%0a31 See B. xxii. c. 33. %0a%0a56 “Cybium.” See B. ix. c. 18.

They say, also, in addition to this, thatpersonswhohave %0ait about them in battle will be sure to display valour. They %0adescribe, too, certain remedies made from the egg of this bird for %0athe hair. But who, pray, has ever had the opportunity of %0aseeing the egg of a horned owl, considering that it is so highly %0aominous to see the bird itsdlf ? 41 And then besides, who has %0aever thought proper to make the experiment, and upon his hair %0amore particularly ? In addition to all this, the magicians go %0aso far as to engage to make the hair curl by using the blood of %0athe young of the horned owl. %0a%0aWhat they tell us, too, about the bat, appears to belong to %0apretty much the same class of stories : if one of these animals is %0acarried alive, three times round a house, they say, and then %0anailed outside of the window with the head downwards, it will %0ahave all the effects of a countercharm : they assert, also, that the %0abat is a most excellent preservative for sheepfolds, being first %0acarried three times round them, and then hung up by the foot %0aover the lintel of the door . 42 The blood of the bat is also %0arecommended by them as a sovereign remedy, in combination %0awith a thistle , 43 for injuries inflicted by serpents. %0a%0aCHAP. 27.-REMEDIES FOR THE BITE OF THE PHALANGIDM.

Its sting is much more %0aacute than that of the wasp, and it lives mostly in the vicinity %0aof ovens and mills. The proper remedy is, to present before %0athe eyes of the person stung another insect of the same de¬ %0ascription, a purpose for which they are preserved when found %0adead. Their husks also, found in a dry state, are beaten up %0aand taken in drink for a similar purpose. The young of the %0aweasel, too, as already 45 stated, are possessed of a similar pro¬ %0aperty. The Greeks give the name of “ phalangion” also to a %0akind of spider, but they generally distinguish it by the surname %0aof the “wolf .” 46 A third kind, also known as the “phalan- %0agium,” is a spider with a hairy 47 body, and a head of enormous %0asize. When opened, there are found in it two small worms, %0athey say: these, attached in a piece of deer’s skin, before sun¬ %0arise, to a woman’s body, will prevent conception, according to %0awhat Cmcilius, in his Commentaries, says. This property lasts, %0ahowever, for a year only ; and, indeed, it is the only one of all %0athe anti-conceptives 48 that I feel myself at liberty to mention, %0ain favour of some women whose fecundity, quite teeming with %0achildren , 48 stands in need of some such respite. %0a%0aThere is another kind again, called “ rhagion ,” 50 similar to %0aa black grape in appearance, with a very diminutive mouth, %0asituate beneath the abdomen, and extremely short legs, which %0ahave all the appearance of not being fully developed. The bite %0aof this last insect causes fully as much pain as the sting of the %0ascorpion, and the urine of persons who are injured by it, pre¬ %0asents filmy appearances like cobwebs. The asterion 61 would be %0aidentical with it, were it not distinguished by white streaks %0aupon the body : its bite causes failing in the knees. But %0aworse than either of these last, is a blue spider, covered with %0ablack hair, and causing dimness of the sight and vomiting of %0aa matter like cobwebs in appearance.

The myrroecion 52 in the head %0aresembles the ant, has a black body spotted with white, and %0acauses by its bite a pain like that attendant upon the stiDg of %0athe wasp. Of the tetragnathius 43 there are two varieties, the %0amore noxious of which has two white streaks crossing each %0aother on the middle of the head; its bite causes the mouth %0ato swell. The other one is of an ashy colour, whitish on tho %0aposterior part of the body, and not so ready to bite. %0a%0aThe least noxious of all is the spider that is seen extending %0aits web along the walls, and lying in wait for flies; it is of the %0asame ashy colour as the last. %0a%0aFor the bite of all spiders, the best remedies are : a cock’s %0abrains, taken in oxycrate with a little pepper; five ants, swal¬ %0alowed in drink ; sheep’s dung, applied in vinegar ; and spiders %0aof any kind, left to putrefy in oil. The bite of the shrew- %0amouse is cured by taking lamb’s rennet in wine ; the ashes of a %0aram’s foot with honey ; or a young weasel, prepared in manner %0aalready 54 mentioned by us when speaking of serpents. In %0acases where a shrewmouse has bitten beasts of burden, a mouse, %0afresh caught, is applied to the wound with oil, or a bat’s gall %0awith vinegar. The shrew-mouse itself too, split asunder and %0aapplied to the wound, is a cure for its bite; indeed, if the %0aanimal is with young when the injury is inflicted, it will %0ainstantly burst asunder. The best plan is to apply the mouse %0aitself which has inflicted the bite, but others are commonly %0akept for this purpose, either steeped in oil or coated with clay. %0aAnother remedy, again, for its bite is the earth taken from the %0arut made by a cart-wheel; for this animal, it is said, owing %0ato a certain torpor which is natural to it, will never cross 54 %0aa rut made by a wheel. %0a%0aCHAP. 28 . -BEMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE STELLIO OR SPOTTED %0a%0aLIZARD. %0a%0aThe stellio, in its turn, is said to have the greatest antipathy %0ato the scorpion ; 46 so much so indeed, that the very sight of it %0astrikes terror in that reptile, and a torpor attended with cold %0asweats; hence it is that this lizard is left to putrefy in oil, as %0a%0a52 From fivpfir)!-, “an ant.” 53 The “four-jawed” spider. %0a%0a54 In c. 16 of this Book. 55 See B. viii. e. 83. %0a%0a56 See B. six. c. 22.

Any kind of pebble, applied to the wound %0aon the side which has lain next to the ground, will alleviate the %0apain. A potsherd too, covered with earth on any part of it, and %0aapplied just as it is found, will effect a cure, it is said—the %0aperson, however, who applies it must not look behind him, %0aand must be equally careful that the sun does not shine upon %0ahim. Earth-worms also, are pounded and applied to the %0awound; in addition to which, they form ingredients in numerous %0aother medicaments, being kept in honey for the purpose. %0a%0aFor injuries inflicted by bees, wasps, hornets, and leeches, %0athe owlet is considered a very useful remedy ; persons, too, who %0acarry about them the beak of the woodpecker 88 of Mars are %0anever injured by any of these creatures. The smaller kinds %0aof locusts also, destitute of wings and known as “ attelebi,” %0aare a good remedy for the sting of the scorpion. %0a%0aThere is a kind of venomous ant, by no means common in %0aItaly; Cicero calls it “solipuga,” and in Baetica it is known %0aas “ salpuga .” 49 The proper remedy for its venom and that %0aof all kinds of ants is a bat’s heart. We have already 60 stated %0athat cantharides are an antidote to the salamander. %0a%0aCHAP. 30.- REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CANTHARIDES. %0a%0aBut with reference to cantharides, there has been considerable %0a%0a47 This is probably an error; see the Note to B. xi. c. 31. %0a%0aM See B. x. cc. 18, 41, 44, and 50. %0a%0a59 See B. viii. c. 43.

There is no doubt, %0ahowever, that applied externally they are useful, in combina¬ %0ation with juice of Taminian 62 grapes, and the suet of a sheep %0aor she-goat. As to the part of the body in which the poison %0aof the insect is situate, authors are by no means agreed. Some %0afancy that it exists in the feet and head, while others, again, %0adeny it; indeed the only point that has been well ascertained is, %0athat the wings 63 are the only antidote to their venom, wherever %0ait may be situate. %0a%0aCantharides are produced from a small grub, found more %0aparticularly in the spongy excrescences which grow on the %0astem of the dog-rose , 64 and still more abundantly upon the %0aash. Other kinds, again, are found upon the white rose, but %0athey are by no means so efficacious. The most active of all %0ain their properties, are those which are spotted with yellow %0astreaks running transversely across the wings, and are plump %0aand well-filled. Those which are small, broad, and hairy, %0aare not so powerful in their operation, and the least useful of all %0aare those which are thin and shrivelled, and present one uniform %0acolour. They are put in a small earthen pot, not coated with %0apitch, and stopped at the mouth with a linen cloth, a layer of %0afull-blown roses being placed upon them ; they are then sus¬ %0apended over vinegar boiled with salt, until the steam has pene¬ %0atrated the cloth and stifled them, after which they are put by %0afor use. They have a caustic effect upon the skin, and cover %0athe ulcerations with a crust; a property which belongs also %0ato the pine-caterpillar 65 found upon the pitch-tree, and to the %0abuprestis , 66 both of which are prepared in a similar manner. %0a%0aAll these insects are extremely efficacious for the cure of %0a%0a61 See B. xxvi. c. 2. 62 See B. xxiii. c. 14. %0a%0a63 It has been ascertained by experiment that the vesicatory principle %0aresides in the wings more particularly.

This honey, too, taken in wine, is a %0aremedy for indispositions caused by eating fish. %0a%0aCHAP. 32. — KEMEDIES FOB THE BITE OF THE MAD DOG. %0a%0aWhen a person has been bitten by a mad dog, he may be %0apreserved from hydrophobia by applying the ashes of a dog's %0ahead to the wound. All ashes of this description, we may %0ahere remark once for all, are prepared in the same method; %0athe substance being placed in a new earthen vessel well covered %0awith potter’s clay, and put into a furnace. These ashes, too, %0aare very good, taken in drink, and hence some recommend the %0ahead itself to be eaten in such cases. Others, again, attach to the %0abody of the patient a maggot, taken from the carcase of a dead %0adog; or else place the menstruous blood of a bitch, in a linen %0acloth, beneath his cup, or insert in the wound ashes of hairs %0afrom the tail of the dog that inflicted the bite. Dogs will fly %0afrom any one who has a dog’s heart about him, and they will %0anever bark at a person who carries a dog’s tongue in his shoe, %0abeneath the great toe, or the tail of a weasel which has been %0aset at liberty after being deprived of it. There is beneath the %0atongue of a mad dog a certain slimy spittle, which, taken in %0adrink, is a preventive of hydrophobia: but much the most %0auseful plan is, to take the liver of the dog that has inflicted %0athe injury, and eat it raw, if possible; should that not be the %0acase, it must be cooked in some way or other, or else a broth %0amust be taken, prepared from the flesh. %0a%0a41 At the sale, under liis supervision, of the property of Ptolemy, king %0aof Cyprus. 68 In ®. c - 34 - %0a%0a%0a%0a406 %0a%0a%0apliny’s natural history. %0a%0a%0a[Book XXIX. %0a%0a%0aThere is a small worm 69 in a dog’s tongue, known as “ lytta’’ ,# %0ato the Greeks: if this is removed from the animal while a %0apup, it will never become mad or lose its appetite. This worm, %0aafter being carried thrice round a tire, is given to persons who %0ahave been bitten by a mad dog, to prevent them from becom¬ %0aing mad. This madness, too, is prevented by eating a cock’s %0abrains ; but the virtue of these brains lasts for one year only, %0aand no more. They say, too, that a cock’s comb, pounded, is %0ahighly efficacious as an application to the wound; as also, %0agoose-grease, mixed with honey. The flesh also of a mad %0adog is sometimes salted, and taken with the food, as a remedy %0afor this disease. In addition to this, young puppies of the %0asame sex as the dog that has inflicted the injury, are drowned %0ain water, and the person who has been bitten eats their liver %0araw.The dung of poultry, provided it is of a red colour, is %0aver} r useful, applied with vinegar; the ashes, too, of the tail %0aof a shrew-mouse, if the animal has survived and been set at %0aliberty; a clod from a swallow’s nest, applied with vinegar; %0athe young of a swallow, reduced to ashes; or the skin or old %0aslough of a serpent that has been cast in spring, beaten up %0awith a male crab in wine : this slough, I would remark, put %0aaway by itself in chests and drawers, destroys moths. %0a%0aSo virulent is the poison of the mad dog, that its very urine %0aeven, if trod upon, is injurious, more particularly if the person %0ahas any ulcerous sores about him. The proper remedy in such %0acase is to apply horse-dung, sprinkled with vinegar, and warmed %0ain a fig. These marvellous properties of the poison will occa¬ %0asion the less surprise, when we remember that, “ a stone bitten %0aby a dog ” has become a proverbial expression for discord and %0avariance. 71 Whoever makes water where a dog has previ¬ %0aously watered, will be sensible of numbness in the loins, they %0asay. %0a%0a69 This is still the vulgar notion ; but in reality there is no worm, but %0acertain white pustules beneath the tongue, which break spontaneously at %0athe end of twelve days after birth. Puppies are still “ wormed,” as it is %0acalled, as a preventive of hydrophobia, it is said, and of a propensity to %0agnaw objects which come in their way. The “ worming ” consists in the %0abreaking of these pustules. 70 “ Rage ” or “ madness.” %0a%0a71 “ For the manner of a dog is to bee angrie with the stone that is %0athrown at him, without regard to the partie that flung it, whereupon grew %0athe proverb in Greeke, kvo>v tov \i0ov liyavaKrouaci (‘ A dog ventiug %0ahis rage upon a stone.’)”— Holland. %0a%0a%0aChap. 33.] REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER POISONS. 407 %0a%0aThe lizard known by some persons as the “ seps,” 72 and by %0aothers as the “ chalcidice,” taken in wine, is a cure for its %0aown bite. %0a%0aCHAP. 33.- REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER TOISONS. %0a%0aWhere persons have been poisoned by noxious preparations %0afrom the wild weasel, 73 the proper remedy is the broth of an %0aold cock, taken in considerable quantities. This broth, too, %0ais particularly good, taken as a counter-poison for aconite, in %0acombination with a little salt. Poultry dung—but the white %0apart only—boiled with hyssop, or with honied wine, is an ex¬ %0acellent antidote to the poison of fungi and of mushrooms : it is %0aa cure also for flatulency and suffocations ; a thing the more to %0abe wondered at, seeing that if any other living creature only %0atastes this dung, it is immediately attacked with griping pains %0aand flatulency. Goose blood, taken with an equal quantity of %0aolive oil, is an excellent neutralizer of the venom of the sea- %0ahare : it is kept also as an antidote for all kinds of noxious %0adrugs,made up into lozenges with red earth of Lemnos and juice %0aof white-thorn, five drachmae of the lozenges being taken in %0athree cyathi of water. The same property belongs also to the %0ayoung of the weasel, prepared in manner already 74 mentioned. %0a%0aLambs’ rennet is an excellent antidote to all noxious pre¬ %0aparations ; the blood, also, of ducks from Pontus ; 75 for which %0areason it is preserved in a dry state, and dissolved in wine when %0awanted, some persons being of opinion that the blood of the %0afemale bird is the most efficacious. In a similar manner, the %0acrop of a stork acts as an universal counter-poison ; and so does %0asheep’s rennet. A broth made from ram’s flesh is particu¬ %0alarly good as a remedy for cantharides: sheep’s milk also, taken %0awarm; this last being very useful in cases where persons %0ahave drunk an infusion of aconite, or have swallowed the %0abuprestis in drink. The dung of wood -pigeons is particularly %0agood taken internally as an antidote to quicksilver; and for %0a%0a,J Sec B. xx. cc. 6, 20.

(6.)-REMEDIES FOR ALOPECY. %0a%0aWhere the hair has been lost through alopecy, 76 it is made %0ato grow again by using ashes of burnt sheep’s dung, with oil of %0aCyprus 77 and honey ; or else the hoof of a mule of either sex, %0aburnt to ashes and mixed with oil of myrtle. In addition to these %0asubstances, we find our own writer, Yarro, mentioning mouse- %0adung, which he calls “ muscerda,” 78 and the heads of flies, %0aapplied fresh, the part being first rubbed with a fig-leaf. %0aSome recommend the blood of flies, while others, again, apply %0aashes of burnt flies for ten days, in the proportion of one part %0aof the ashes to two of ashes of papyrus or of nuts. In other %0acases, again, we find ashes of burnt flies kneaded up with %0awoman’s milk and cabbage, or, in some instances, with honey %0aonly. It is generally believed that there is no creature less %0adocile or less intelligent than the fly; a circumstance which %0amakes it all the more marvellous that at the sacred games at %0aOlympia, immediately after the immolation of the bull in %0ahonour of the god called ** Myiodes,” 79 whole clouds of them %0atake their departure from that territory. A mouse’s head or %0atail, or, indeed, the whole of the body, reduced to ashes, is a %0acure for alopecy, more particularly when the loss of the hair has %0abeen the result of some noxious preparation. The ashes of a %0ahedge-hog, mixed with honey, or of its skin, applied with tar, %0aare productive of a similar effect. The head, too, of this last %0aanimal, reduced to ashes, restores the hair to scars upon the %0abody ; the place being first prepared, when this cure is made %0ause of, with a razor and an application of mustard: some %0apersons, however, prefer vinegar for the purpose. All the %0aproperties attributed to the hedge-hog are found in the por¬ %0acupine in a still higher degree. 80 %0a%0aA lizard burnt, as already 81 mentioned, with the fresh root %0aof a reed, cut as fine as possible, to facilitate its being re- %0a%0a76 So called from a\ivn “ a fox,” an animal very subject to the loss %0aof its hair. 17 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%0a78 So swine’s dung was called “ sucerda,” and cowdung “ bucerda." %0a%0a79 Or Maagrus, the “fly catcher,” the name of a hero, invoked at Ali- %0aphera, at the festivals of Athena, as the protector against flies.

For all these purposes %0agreen lizards are still more efficacious, and the remedy is ren¬ %0adered most effectual, when salt is added, bears’ grease, and %0apounded onions. Some persons boil ten green lizards in ten %0a6extarii of oil, and content themselves with rubbing the place %0awith the mixture once a month. Alopecy is also cured very %0aspeedily with the ashes of a viper’s skin, or by an application %0aof fresh poultry dung. A raven’s egg, beaten up in a copper %0avessel and applied to the head, previously shaved, imparts a %0ablack colour to the hair ; care must be taken, however, to keep %0asome oil in the mouth till the application is quite dry, or else %0athe teeth will turn black as well. The operation must be per¬ %0aformed also in the shade, and the liniment must not be washed %0aoff before the end of three days. Some persons employ the %0ablood and brains of a raven, in combination with red wine; %0awhile others, again, boil down the bird, and put it, at bedtime, %0ain a vessel made of lead. With some it is the practice, for %0athe cure of alopecy, to apply bruised cantharides with tar, the %0askin being first prepared with an application of nitre :—it %0ashould be remembered, however, that cantharides are possessed %0aof caustic properties, and due care must be taken not to let %0athem eat too deep into the skin. For the ulcerations thus pro¬ %0aduced, it is recommended to use applications made of the heads, %0agall, and dung of mice, mixed with hellebore and pepper. %0a%0aCHAP. 35. -EEMEDIES FOE LICE AND FOE PORKIGO. %0a%0aNits are destroyed by using dogs’ fat, eating serpents cooked 62 %0alike eels, or else taking their sloughs in drink.

The brains of a crow or owlet, are boiled and taken %0awith the food : or a cock is put into a coop, and kept without %0afood a day and a night, the patient submitting to a similar %0aabstinence, and attaching to his head some feathers plucked %0afrom the neck or the comb of the fowl. The ashes, too, of a %0aweasel are applied in the form of a liniment; a twig is taken %0afrom a kite’s nest, and laid beneath the patient’s pillow; or a %0amouse’s skin is burnt, and the ashes applied with vinegar: %0asometimes, also, the small bone is extracted from the head of %0aa snail that has been found between two cart ruts, and after %0abeing passed through a gold ring, with a piece of ivory, is %0aattached to the patient in a piece of dog’s skin ; a remedy %0awell known to most persons, and always used with success.®* %0a%0aFor fractures of the cranium, cobwebs are applied, with oil %0aand vinegar; the application never coming away till a cure %0ahas been effected.

The %0ahead of a snail cut off with a reed, while feeding in the %0amorning, at full moon more particularly, is attached to the %0ahead in a linen cloth, with an old thrum, for the cure of head¬ %0aache ; or else a liniment is made of it, and applied with white %0awax to the forehead. Dogs’ hairs are worn also, attached to %0athe forehead in a cloth. %0a%0aCHAP. 37.-REMEDIES FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE EYELIDS. %0a%0aA crow 8 brains, taken with the food, they say, will make %0athe eyelashes grow ; or else wool-grease, applied with warmed %0amyrrh, by the aid of a fine probe.

For the same purpose, also, the young ones %0aof a mouse are beaten up, in old wine, to the consistency of the %0aBtrengthening preparations known as “ acopa.” 86 When eye¬ %0alashes are plucked out that are productive of inconvenience, they %0aare prevented from growing again by using a hedge-hog’s gall; %0athe liquid portion, also, of a spotted lizard’s eggs; the ashes %0aof a burnt salamander; the gall of a green lizard, mixed with %0awhite wine, and left to thicken to the consistency of honey in . %0aa copper vessel in the sun ; the ashes of a swallow’s young, %0amixed with the milky juice of tithymalos j 87 or else the slime %0aof 6nails. %0a%0aCHAP. 38. -REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE EYES. %0a%0aAccording to what the magicians say, glaucoma 88 may be %0acured by using the brains of a puppy seven days old; the probe %0abeing inserted in the right side [of the eye], if it is the right %0aeye that is being operated on, and in the left side, if it is the %0aleft. The fresh gall, too, of the asio 89 is used, a bird belonging %0ato the owlet tribe, with feathers standing erect like ears. %0aApollonius of Pitanae used to prefer dog’s gall, in combina¬ %0ation with honey, to that of the hyaena, for the cure of cataract, %0aas also of albugo. The heads and tails of mice, reduced to %0aashes and applied to the eyes, improve the sight, it is said ; a %0aresult which is ensured with even greater certainty by using the %0aashes of a dormouse or wild mouse, or else the brains or gall %0aof an eagle. The ashes and fat of a field-mouse, beaten up %0awith Attic honey and antimony, are remarkably useful for %0awatery eyes—what this antimony 90 is, we shall have occasion %0ato say when speaking of metals. %0a%0aFor the cure of cataract, the ashes of a weasel are used, as %0aalso the brains of a lizard or swallow. Weasels, boiled and %0apounded, and so applied to the forehead, allay defluxions of the %0aeyes, either used alone, or else with fine flour or with frankin¬ %0acense. Employed in a similar manner, they are very good for %0asun-stroke, or in other words, for injuries inflicted by the sun. %0a%0aIt is a remarkably good plan, too, to burn these animals alive, %0aand to use their ashes, with Cretan honey, as a liniment for %0a%0a>6 See c. 13 of this Book. 87 See B. xxvi. c. 39. %0a%0aA disease of the crystalline humours of the eye. %0a%0aw See B. x. c. 33. 90 “ Stibium.” See B. xxxiii. c. 33. %0a%0a%0a412 %0a%0a%0aPLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a[Hook XXIX. %0a%0a%0afilms upon the eyes. The cast-off 91 slough of the asp, with %0athe fat of that reptile, forms an excellent ointment for im¬ %0aproving the sight in beasts of burden. To burn a viper alive %0ain a new earthen vessel, with one cyathus of fennel juice, %0aand a single grain of frankincense, and then to anoint the eyes %0awith the mixture, is remarkably good for cataract and films %0aupon the eyes; the preparation being generally known as %0a“echeon.” 91 * An eye-salve, too, is prepared, by leaving a %0aviper to putrefy in an earthen pot, and bruising the maggots %0athat breed in it with saffron. A viper, too, is burnt in a %0avessel with salt, and the preparation is applied to the tip of %0athe tongue, to improve the eyesight, and to act generally as a %0acorrective of the stomach and other parts of the body. This %0asalt is given also to sheep, to preserve them in health, and is %0aused as an ingredient in antidotes to the venom of serpents. %0a%0aSome persons, again, use vipers as an article of food: when %0athis is done, it is recommended, the moment they are killed, %0ato put some salt in the mouth and let it melt there; after %0awhich, the body must be cut away to the length of four fingers %0aat each extremity, and, the intestines being first removed, the %0aremainder boiled in a mixture of water, oil, salt, and dill. %0aWhen thus prepared, they are either eaten at once, or else %0akneaded in a loaf, and taken from time to time as wanted. %0aIn addition to the above-mentioned properties, viper-broth %0acleanses all parts of the body of lice, 92 and removes itching %0asensations as well upon the surface of the skin. The ashes, %0aalso, of a viper’s head, used by themselves, are evidently pro¬ %0aductive of considerable effects; they are employed very advan¬ %0atageously in the form of a liniment for the eyes; and so, too, is %0aviper’s fat. I would not make so bold ae to advise what is %0astrongly recommended by some, the use, namely, of vipers’ %0agall; for that, as already stated 93 on a more appropriate occa¬ %0asion, is nothing else but the venom of the serpent. The fat of %0asnakes, mixed with verdigrease, 94 heals ruptures of the cuticle %0aof the eyes; and the skin or slough that is cast off in spring, %0aemployed as a friction for the eyes, improves the sight. The %0a%0a31 “ Exuta vere,” as suggested by Sillig, would appear a better reading %0athan “ ex utero,” which can have no meaning here. %0a%0a91 * “ Viper mixture.” %0a%0a92 See c. 35 of this Book. 92 In B. xi c. 62. %0a%0a94 As Ajasson remarks, this would be very likely to gangrene thewouud. %0a%0a%0aChap. 38.] BEMF.DIES FOB DISEASES OF THE EYES. 413 %0a%0agall of the boa 95 is highly vaunted for the cure of albugo, cata¬ %0aract, and films upon the eyes, and the fat is thought to improve %0athe sight. %0a%0aThe gall of the eagle, which tests its young, as already %0astated, 96 by making them look upon the sun, forms, with Attic %0ahoney, an eye-salve which is very good for the cure of webs, %0afilms, and cataracts of the eye. A vulture’s gall, too, mixed %0awith leek-juice and a little honey, is possessed of similar pro¬ %0aperties ; and the gall of a cock, dissolved in water, is employed %0afor the cure of argema and albugo : the gall, too, of a white %0acock, in particular, is recommended for cataract^For short¬ %0asighted persons, the dung of poultry is recommended as a lini¬ %0ament, care being taken to use that of a reddish colour only. %0aA hen’s gall, too, is highly spoken of, and the fat in particular, %0afor the cure of pustules upon the pupils, a purpose for which %0ahens are expressly fattened. This last substance is marvel¬ %0alously useful for ruptures of the coats of the eyes, incorporated %0awith the stones known as schistos 91 and haematites. Hens’ %0adung, too, but only the white part of it, is kept with old oil %0ain boxes made of horn, for the cure of white specks upon the %0apupil of the eye. While mentioning this subject, it is worthy %0aof remark, that peacocks 98 swallow their dung, it is said, as %0athough they envied man the various uses of it. A hawk, %0aboiled in oil of roses, is considered extremely efficacious as a lini¬ %0ament for all affections of the eyes, and so are the ashes of its %0adung, mixed with Attic honey. A kite’s liver, too, is highly %0aesteemed; and pigeons’ dung, diluted with vinegar, is used as %0aan application for fistulas of the eye, as also for albugo and %0amarks upon that organ. Goose gall and duck’s blood are very %0auseful for contusions of the eyes, care being taken, immediately %0aafter the application, to anoint them with a mixture of wool- %0agrease and honey. In similar cases, too, gall of partridges is %0aused, with an equal quantity of honey; but where it is only %0awanted to improve the sight, the gall is used alone. It is %0agenerally thought, too, upou the authority of Hippocrates, 99 %0a%0a15 See B. viii. c. 14. Not the Boa constrictor of modern Natural History. %0a%0a%25 In B x. c. 3. %0a%0a* See B. xxxiii. c. 25, and B. xxxvi. cc. 37, 38. %0a%0a* The toneues of peacocks and larks are recommended for epilepsy, by %0a%0aLampridius, in his Life of the Emperor Elagabalus.

For the %0atreatment of blood-shot eyes, the blood of pigeons, ring-doves, %0aturtle-doves, and partridges is remarkably useful; but that %0aof the male pigeon is generally looked upon as the most effica¬ %0acious. For this purpose, a vein is opened beneath the wing, %0ait being warmer than the rest of the blood, and consequently %0amore 1 beneficial. After it is applied, a compress, boiled in %0ahoney, should be laid upon it, and some greasy wool, boiled in %0aoil and wine. Xyctalopy, 2 too, is cured by using the blood of %0athese birds, or the liver of a sheep —the most efficacious %0abeing that of a tawny sheep — as already 3 stated by us %0awhen speaking of goats. A decoction, too, of the liver is %0arecommended as a wash for the eyes, and, for pains and swell¬ %0aings in those organs, the marrow, used as a liniment. The eyes %0aof a horned owl, it is strongly asserted, reduced to ashes and %0amixed in an eye-salve, will improve the sight. Albugo is made %0ato disappear by using the dung of turtle-doves, snails burnt to %0aashes, and the dung of the cenchris, a kind of hawk, according %0ato the Greeks. 4 All the substances above mentioned, used in %0acombination with honey, are curative of argema : honey, too, %0ain which the bees have died, is remarkably good for the eyes. %0a%0aA person who has eaten the young of the stork will never %0asuffer from ophthalmia for many years to come, it is said; and %0athe same when a person carries about him the head of a %0adragon : 5 it is stated, too, that the fat of this last-named %0aanimal, applied with honey and old oil, will disperse incipient %0afilms of the eyes. The young of the swallow are blinded at %0alull moon, and the moment their sight is restored, 6 their heads %0aare burnt, and the ashes are employed, with honey, to improve %0athe sight, and for the cure of pains, ophthalmia, and contu¬ %0asions of the eyes. %0a%0aLizards, also, are employed in numerous ways as a remedy %0a%0a1 A puerile reason, Ajasson remarks.

Some persons enclose a green lizard %0am a new earthen vessel, together with nine of the small stones %0aknown as “ cintedia,” 7 which are usually attached to the body %0afor tumours in the groin. Upon each of these stones they %0amake nine 8 marks, and remove one from the vessel daily, %0ataking care, when the ninth day is come, to let the lizard go’ %0athe stones being kept as a remedy for affections of the eyes! %0aOthers, again, blind a green lizard, and after putting some %0aearth beneath it, enclose it in a glass vessel, with some small %0arings of solid iron or gold. When they find, by looking %0athrough the glass, that the lizard has recovered its sight, 9 they %0aset it at liberty, and keep the rings as a preservative against %0aophthalmia. Others employ the ashes of a lizard’s head as %0aa substitute for antimony, for the treatment of eruptions of the %0aeyes. Some recommend the ashes of the green lizard wdth a long %0aneck that is usually found in sandy soils, as an application for %0aincipient defluxions of the eyes, and for glaucoma. They say, %0atoo, that if the eyes of a -weasel are extracted with a pointed %0ainstrument, its sight will return; the same use being made of it %0aas of the lizards and rings above mentioned. The right eye %0aof a serpent, worn as an amulet, is very good, it is said, for %0adefluxions of the eyes, due care being taken to set the serpent %0aat liberty after extracting the eye. For continuous watering 10 %0aof the eyes, the ashes of a spotted lizard’s head, applied with %0aantimony, are remarkably efficacious. %0a%0aThe cobweb of the common fly-spider, that which lines its %0ahole more particularly, applied to the forehead across the %0atemples, in a compress of some kind or other, is said to be %0amarvellously useful for the cure of defluxions of the eyes : the %0aweb must be taken, however, and applied by the hands of a %0aboy who has not arrived at the years of puberty; the bov, %0atoo, must not show himself to the patient for three days, and %0aduring those three days neither of them must touch the %0aground with his feet uncovered.

The green %0ascarabaeus has the property of rendering the sight more %0apiercing 12 of those who gaze upon it: hence it is that tbe %0aengravers of precious stones use these insects to steady their %0asight. %0a%0achap. 39.—remedies for pains and diseases of the ears. %0a%0aA sheep’s gall, mixed with honey, is a good detergent of the %0aears. Pains in those organs are allayed by injecting a bitch’s %0amilk ; and hardness of hearing is removed by using dogs’ fat, %0awith wormwood and old oil, or else goose-grease. Some per¬ %0asons add juice of onions and of garlic, 12 * in equal proportions. %0aThe eggs, too, of ants are used, by themselves, for this purpose; %0athese insects being possessed, in fact, of certain medicinal pro¬ %0aperties, and bears, it is well known, curing themselves when %0asick, by eating 13 them as food. Goose-grease, and indeed that %0aof all birds, is prepared by removing all the veins and leaving %0athe fat, in a new, shallow, earthen vessel, well covered, to melt %0ain the sun, some boiling water being placed beneath it; which %0adone, it is passed through linen strainers, and is then put by %0ain a cool spot, in a new earthen vessel, for keeping: with the %0aaddition of honey it is less liable to turn rancid. Ashes of %0aburnt mice, injected with honey or boiled with oil of roses, %0aallay pains in the ears. In cases where an insect has got into %0athe ears, a most excellent remedy is found in an injection of %0amouse gall, diluted with vinegar; where, too, water has made %0aits way into the passages of the ear, goose-grease is used, in com¬ %0abination with juice of onions. Some persons skin a dormouse, %0aand after removing the intestines boil the body in a new vessel %0awith honey. Medical men, however, prefer boiling it down %0ato one-third with nard, and recommend it to be kept in that %0astate, and to be warmed when wanted, and injected with a %0asyringe. It is a well-known fact, that this preparation is an %0a%0a12 Green is universally the colour least fatiguing to the eye %0a%0a12 ‘ See B. xx. c. 23. %0a%0a13 See B. vii. c. 27, and B. viii. c. 41.

The red worms, also, that are found upon trees, %0abeaten up with oil, are a most excellent remedy for ulcerations %0aand ruptures of the ears. Lizards, which have been suspended %0afor some time and dried, with salt in the mouth, are curative %0aof contusions of the ears, and of injuries inflicted by blows : %0athe most efficacious for this purpose are those which have iron- %0acoloured spots upon the skin, 14 and are streaked with lines %0aalong the tail. %0a%0aMillepedes, known also as “centipedes” or “multipedes,” %0aare insects belonging to the earth-worm genus, hairy, with %0anumerous feet, forming curves as they crawl, and contracting %0athemselves when touched : the Greeks give to this insect the %0aname of “ouiscos,” 13 others, again, that of “tylos.” Boiled %0awith leek-juice in a pomegranate rind, it is highly efficacious, %0athey say, for pains in the ears; oil of roses being added to %0athe preparation, and the mixture injected into the ear opposite %0ato the one affected. As for that kind which does not describe a %0acurve when moving, the Greeks give it the name of “seps,” %0awhile others, again, call it “ scolopendrait is smaller than the %0aformer one, and is injurious. 16 The snails which are commonly %0aused as food, are applied to the ears with myrrh or powdered %0afrankincense; and those with a small, broad, shell are employed %0awith honey as a liniment for fractured ears. Old sloughs of %0aserpents, burnt in a heated potsherd and mixed with oil ot %0aroses, are used as an injection for the ears, which is considered %0ahighly efficacious for all affections of those organs, and for %0aoffensive odours arising therefrom in particular. In cases %0awhere there is suppuration of the ears, vinegar is used, and it %0ais still better if goat’s gall, ox-gall, or that of the sea tortoise, is %0aadded. This slough, however, is good for nothing when more %0athan a year old; tfye same, too, when it has been drenched with %0a%0a»■» Aiasson suggests that this may be the Lacerta ccepium of Daudin, ol %0aa reddish brown colour, with two blackish lines running longitudinally %0a%0aalong the back. , , , %0a%0a14 This insect in reality is a woodlouse, whereas the millepedes previously %0adescribed are evidently caterpillars. Woodlice are still swallowed alive by %0aschoolboys, and old women are to be found who recommend them tor con¬ %0asumption.

The thick pulp of a spider’s body, mixed %0awith oil of roses, is also used for the ears; or else the pulp applied %0aby itself with saffron or in wool: a cricket, too, is dug up with %0asome of its earth, and applied. Nigidius attributes great 17 %0avirtues to this insect, and the magicians still greater, and all %0abecause it walks backwards, pierces the earth, and chirrups hy %0anight! The mode of catching it is by throwing an ant, 18 made %0afast with a hair, into its hole, the dust being first blown away %0ato prevent it from concealing itself: the moment it seizes the %0aant, it is drawn out. %0a%0aThe dried craw of poultry, a part that is generally thrown %0aaway, is beaten up in wine, and injected warm, for suppura¬ %0ations of the ears; the same, too, with the grease of poultry. %0a%0aOn pulling off the head of a black beetle, 19 it yields a sort %0aof greasy substance, which, beaten up with rose oil, is marvel¬ %0alously good, they say, for affections of the ears: care must be %0ataken, however, to remove the wool very soon, or else this sub¬ %0astance will be speedily transformed into an animal, in the %0ashape of a small grub. Some writers assert that two or three %0aof these insects, boiled in oil, are extremely efficacious for the %0aears ; and that they are good, beaten up and applied in linen, %0afor contusions of those organs. %0a%0aThis insect, also, is one of those that are of a disgusting %0acharacter; but I am obliged, by the admiration which I feel for %0athe operations of Nature, and for the careful researches, of the %0aancients, to enter somewhat more at large upon it on the pre¬ %0asent occasion. Their writers have described several varieties %0aof it; the soft beetle, for instance, which, boiled in oil, has %0abeen found by experience to be a very useful liniment for %0awarts. Another kind, to which they have given the name of %0a“ mylcecon,” 20 is generally found in the vicinity of mills: de¬ %0aprived of the head, it has been found to be curative of leprosy %0a—at least Musa 21 and Picton 22 have cited instances to that effect. %0a%0a17 _ In the middle ages there were many superstitions with reference to %0athis insect, some of which have survived to the present day. %0a%0a^ Ajasson seems to think that this passage means that the ant itself %0aadopts this plan of catching the cricket. If so, he is certainly in error, %0aand his attack upon Pliny’s credulity is, in this instance at least, misplaced. %0a%0a19 See B. xi. c. 34. and B. xxv. c. 60. %0a%0a20 “ Inhabiting mills.” %0a%0a21 See B. xix. c. 38, and B. xxv. c. 38. %0a%0a22 Of this writer nothing is known. %0a%0a%0aChap 39.] %0a%0a%0aSUMMART. %0a%0a%0a419 %0a%0a%0aThere is a third kind, again, odious for its abominable smell, %0aand tapering at the posterior extremities. Used in combina¬ %0ation with pisselaeon, 23 it is curative, they say, of ulcers of u %0adesperate nature, and, if kept applied for one-and-twenty days, %0afor scrofulous sores and inflamed tumours. The legs and wings %0abeing first removed, it is employed for the cure of bruises, contu¬ %0asions, cancerous sores, itch-scabs, and boils—remedies, all of %0athem, quite disgusting even to hear of. And yet, by Hercules ! %0aDiodorus 24 tells us that he has administered this remedy inter¬ %0anally, with resin and honey, for jaundice and hardness of %0abreathing; such unlimited power has the medical art to pre¬ %0ascribe as a remedy whatever it thinks fit! %0a%0aPhysicians who keep more within bounds, recommend the %0aashes of these insects to be kept for these various purposes in a %0abox made of horn; or else that they should be bruised and injected %0ain a lavement for hardness of breathing and catarrhs. At all %0aevents, that, applied externally, they extract foreign substances %0aadhering to the flesh, is a fact well known. %0a%0aHoney, too, in which the bees have died, is remarkably use¬ %0aful for affections of the ears. Pigeons’ dung, applied by itself, %0aor with barley-meal or oat-meal, reduces imposthumes of the %0aparotid glands ; a result which is equally obtained by injecting %0ainto the ear an owlet’s brains or liver, mixed with oil, or by %0aapplying the mixture to the parotid glands; also, by applying %0amillepedes with one-third part of resin ; by using crickets in the %0aform of a liniment; or by wearing crickets attached to the body %0aas an amulet.

The other was a native %0aof Cnidos, and, according to Suidas, a slave of the philosopher Chry- %0asippus. Galen, however, says that he was a pupil of the physician of that %0aname, and afterwards became physician to Antigonus Gonatas, king of %0aMacedonia, b c. 283—239.

(1.)-THE ORIGIN OF THE MEDICAL ART. %0a%3c %0a%3c The nature and multiplicity of the various remedies already %0a%3c described or which still remain to be enlarged upon, compel %0a%3c me to enter upon some further details with reference to the %0a%3c art of medicine itself: aware as I am, that no one 1 has hitherto %0a%3c treated of this subject in the Latin tongue, and that if all new %0a%3c enterprises are difficult or of doubtful success, it must be one in %0a%3c particular which is so barren of all charms to recommend it, %0a%3c and accompanied with such difficulties of illustration. It will %0a%3c not improbably suggest itself, however, to those who are fami¬ %0a%3c liar with this subject, to make enquiry how it is that in the %0a%3c practice of medicine the use of simples has been abandoned, %0a%3c so convenient as they are and so ready prepared to our hand: %0a%3c and they will be inclined to feel equal surprise and indignation %0a%3c when they are informed that no known art, lucrative as this is %0a%3c beyond all the rest, has been more fluctuating, or subjected to %0a%3c more frequent variations. %0a%3c %0a%3c Commencing by ranking its inventors in the number of the %0a%3c gods, 2 and consecrating for them a place in heaven, the art of me¬ %0a%3c dicine, at the present day even, teaches us in numerous instances %0a%3c to have recourse to the oracles for aid. In more recent times %0a%3c again, the same art has augmented its celebrity', at the cost perhaps %0a%3c of being charged with criminality, by devising the fable that %0a%3c JUsculapius was struck by lightning for presuming to raise Tyn- %0a%3c dareus 3 to life. And this example notwithstanding, it has not %0a%3c hesitated to relate how that others, through its agency, have %0a%3c since been restored to life.

DATE OF THE %0a%3c %0a%3c ORIGIN OF CLINICAL PRACTICE AND OF THAT OF IATRALIPTICS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Its succeeding history, a fact that is truly marvellous, re¬ %0a%3c mains enveloped in the densest night, down to the time of %0a%3c the Peloponnesian War ; 4 at which period it was restored to %0a%3c light by the agency of Hippocrates, a native of Cos, an island %0a%3c flourishing and powerful in the highest degree, and consecrated %0a%3c to iEsculapius. It being the practice for persons tvho had re¬ %0a%3c covered from a disease to describe in the temple of that god the %0a%3c remedies to which they had owed their restoration to health, %0a%3c that others might derive benefit therefrom in a similar emer¬ %0a%3c gency ; Hippocrates, it is said, copied out these prescriptions, %0a%3c and, as our fellow-countryman Varro will have it, after burn¬ %0a%3c ing the temple to the ground, 4 * instituted that branch of medi¬ %0a%3c cal practice which is known as “Clinics.” 5 There was no %0a%3c limit after this to the profits derived from the practice of medi¬ %0a%3c cine ; for Prodicus, 6 a native of Selymbria, one of his disciples, %0a%3c founded the branch of it known as “ Iatraliptics,” 7 and so dis¬ %0a%3c covered a means of enriching the very anointers even and the %0a%3c commonest drudges 8 employed by the physicians. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 3. —-PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO CHRT8IPPUS AND ERASIS- %0a%3c TltATUS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the rules laid down by these professors, changes were %0a%3c effected by Ckrysippus with a vast parade of words, and, after %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 Hippocrates is generally supposed to have been born b.c. 460. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 * In order to destroy the medical books and prescriptions there.

THE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT HAVE %0a%3c %0a%3c BEEN MADE IN THE SYSTEM OF MEDICINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c These several schools of medicine, long at variance among %0a%3c themselves, were all of them condemned by Herophilus, 12 who %0a%3c regulated the arterial pulsation according to the musical 13 %0a%3c scale, correspondingly with the age of the patient. In suc¬ %0a%3c ceeding years again, the theories of this sect were abandoned, %0a%3c it being found that to belong to it necessitated an acquaintance %0a%3c with literature. Changes, too, were effected in the school, of %0a%3c which, as already 13 * stated, Asclepiades had become the founder. %0a%3c His disciple, Themison, 14 who at first in his writings implicitly %0a%3c followed him, soon afterwards, in compliance with the growing %0a%3c degeneracy of the age, went so far as to modify his own me¬ %0a%3c thods of treatment; which, in their turn, were entirely dis¬ %0a%3c placed, with the authorization of the late Emperor Augustus, %0a%3c by Antonius Musa, 15 a physician who had rescued that prince %0a%3c %0a%3c 9 Pythias, the daughter of Aristotle, was his stepmother, and adopted %0a%3c him. His mother’s name was Cretoxena. %0a%3c %0a%3c 10 Or “ Sect of Experimentalists.” They based their practice upon ex¬ %0a%3c perience derived from the observation of facts.

As for Q. Stertinius, he thought that he conferred %0a%3c an obligation upon the emperors in being content with five %0a%3c hundred thousand 16 sesterces per annum ; and indeed he proved, %0a%3c by an enumeration of the several houses, that a city practice %0a%3c would bring him in a yearly income of not less than six hun¬ %0a%3c dred thousand sesterces. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fully equal to this was the sum lavished upon his brother %0a%3c by Claudius Caesar ; and the two brothers, although they had %0a%3c drawn largely upon their fortunes in beautifying the public %0a%3c buildings at Neapolis, left to their heirs no less than thirty %0a%3c millions of sesterces ! 17 such an estate as no physician but Ar- %0a%3c runtius had till then possessed. %0a%3c %0a%3c Next in succession arose Yettius Yalens, rendered so noto¬ %0a%3c rious by his adulterous connection 18 with Messalina, the wife %0a%3c ot Claudius Caesar, and equally celebrated as a professor of %0a%3c eloquence. When established in public favour, he became the %0a%3c founder of a new sect; %0a%3c %0a%3c __ It was in the same age, too, during the reign of the Emperor %0a%3c Nero, that the destinies of the medical art passed into the %0a%3c hands of Thessalus, 19 a man who swept away all the precepts %0a%3c of his predecessors, and declaimed with a sort of frenzy against %0a%3c the physicians of every age; but with what discretion and %0a%3c in what spirit, we may abundantly conclude from a single trait %0a%3c presented by his character—upon his tomb, which is still %0a%3c to be seen on the Appian Way, he had his name inscribed as %0a%3c the “ Iatronices ’’—the “ Conqueror of the Physicians.” No %0a%3c stage-player, no driver of a three-horse chariot, had a greater %0a%3c throng attending him when he appeared in public: but he %0a%3c was at last eclipsed in credit by Crinas, a native of Massilia, %0a%3c who, to wear an appearance of greater discreetness and more %0a%3c devoutness, united in himself the pursuit of two sciences, and %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 Rather more than £4400. 17 More than £265,000. %0a%3c %0a%3c 16 For which he was put to death a.d. 48. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 A native of Tralles in Lydia, and the son of a weaver there.

It was but recently that he died, %0a%3c leaving ten millions of sesterces, after having expended hardly %0a%3c a less sum upon building the walls of his native place and %0a%3c of other towns. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was while these men were ruling our destinies, that %0a%3c all at once, Charmis, a native also of Massilia, took 20 the %0a%3c City by surprise. Not content with condemning the practice %0a%3c of preceding physicians, he proscribed the use of warm baths %0a%3c as well, and persuaded people, in the very depth of winter %0a%3c even, to immerse themselves in cold water. His patients %0a%3c he used to plunge into large vessels filled with cold water, %0a%3c and it was a common thing to see aged men of consular %0a%3c rank make it a matter of parade to freeze themselves; a %0a%3c method of treatment, in favour of which Annaeus 21 Seneca gives %0a%3c his personal testimony, in writings still extant. %0a%3c %0a%3c There can be no doubt whatever, that all these men, in the %0a%3c pursuit of celebrity by the introduction of some novelty or other, %0a%3c made purchase of it at the downright expense of human life. %0a%3c Hence those woeful discussions, those consultations at the bed¬ %0a%3c side of the patient, where no one thinks fit to be of the same %0a%3c opinion as another, lest he may have the appearance of being %0a%3c subordinate to another; hence, too, that ominous inscription %0a%3c to be read upon a tomb, “ It was the multitude of physicians %0a%3c that killed me.” 22 %0a%3c %0a%3c The medical art, so often modified and renewed as it has %0a%3c been, is still on the change from day to day, and still are we %0a%3c impelled onwards by the puffs 23 which emanate from the in¬ %0a%3c genuity of the Greeks. It is quite evident too, that every %0a%3c one among them that finds himself skilled in the art of speech, %0a%3c may forthwith create himself the arbiter of our life and death: %0a%3c as though, forsooth, there were not thousands 24 of nations who %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 “Invasit.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 Ep. 53 and 83.

Cassius Hemina, 26 %0a%3c one of our most ancient writers, says that the first physician %0a%3c that visited Rome was Archagathus, the son of Lysanias, who %0a%3c came over from Peloponnesus, in the year of the City 535, L. %0a%3c JEmilius and M. Livius being consuls. He states also, that the %0a%3c right of free citizenship 27 was granted him, and that he had a %0a%3c shop 28 provided for his practice at the public expense in the %0a%3c Acilian Cross-way ; 29 that from his practice he received the %0a%3c name of “ Vulnerarius ;” 80 that on his arrival he was greatly %0a%3c welcomed at first, but that soon afterwards, from the cruelty %0a%3c displayed by him in cutting and searing his patients, he ac¬ %0a%3c quired the new name of “ Carnifex,” 31 and brought his art and %0a%3c physicians in general into considerable disrepute. %0a%3c %0a%3c That such was the fact, we may readily understand from the %0a%3c words of M. Cato, a man whose authority stands so high of %0a%3c itself, that but little weight is added to it by the triumph 32 %0a%3c which he gained, and the Censorship which he held. I shall, %0a%3c therefore, give his own words in reference to this subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 7.—THE OPINIONS ENTERTAINED BY THE ROMANS ON THE %0a%3c * ANCIENT PHYSICIANS. %0a%3c %0a%3c “ Concerning those Greeks, son Marcus, I will speak to you %0a%3c %0a%3c Bastitani, a people of Spain; and Eusebius, the more ancient inhabitants %0a%3c of Spain. « See B. xx. c. 33. %0a%3c %0a%3c 26 See end of B. xii. 27 “Jus Quiritium.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 “Tabernam.” A surgery, in fact, the same as the “ iatreion’’ of the %0a%3c Greeks. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 Or “ carrefour ”—“ compitum.’’ The Acilian Gens pretended to be %0a%3c under the especial tutelage of the gods of medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 The “ Wound-curer,’’ from “vulnus,” a wound. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 “Executioner,” or “hangman.” 32 For his conquests in Spain. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 376 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c more at length on the befitting occasion.

They are a most iniqui¬ %0a%3c tous and intractable race, and you may take my word as the word %0a%3c of a prophet, when I tell you, that whenever that nation shall %0a%3c bestow itsliterature upon Rome it will mar everything; and that %0a%3c all the sooner, if it sends its physicians among us. They have %0a%3c conspired among themselves to murder all' barbarians with their %0a%3c medicine; a profession which they exercise for lucre, in order %0a%3c that they may win our confidence, 34 and dispatch us all the %0a%3c more easily. They are in the common habit, too, of calling us %0a%3c barbarians, and stigmatize us beyond all other nations, by %0a%3c giving us the abominable appellation of Opici. 35 I forbid you %0a%3c to have anything to do with physicians.” %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8.—EVILS ATTENDANT UPON THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato, who wrote to this effect, died in his eighty-fifth year, %0a%3c in the year of the City 605 ; so that no one is to suppose that %0a%3c he had not sufficient time to form his experience, either with %0a%3c reference to the duration of the republic, or the length of his %0a%3c own life. Well then—are we to conclude that he has stamped %0a%3c with condemnation a thing that in itself is most useful ? Tar %0a%3c from it, by Hercules ! for he subjoins an account of the medical %0a%3c prescriptions, by the aid of which he had ensured to himself %0a%3c and to his wife a ripe old age; prescriptions 36 upon which we are %0a%3c now about to enlarge. He asserts also that he has a book of %0a%3c recipes in his possession, by the aid of which he treats the %0a%3c maladies of his son, his servants, and his friends; a book from %0a%3c which we have extracted the various prescriptions according to %0a%3c the several maladies for which they are employed. %0a%3c %0a%3c It was not the thing itself that the ancients condemned, but %0a%3c it was the art as then practised, and they were shocked, more %0a%3c particularly, that man should pay so dear for the enjoyment of %0a%3c life. For this reason it was, they say, that the Temple of %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 “ Illorum literas inspicere.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 34 On the principle that that which costs money must be worth having. %0a%3c %0a%3c 35 The Opici or Osci were an ancient tribe of Italy, settled in Campania, %0a%3c Latiura, and Samnium. From their uncivilized habits the name was long %0a%3c used as a reproachful epithet, equivalent to our words “ bumpkin,” “clod¬ %0a%3c hopper,” or “ chawbacon.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 36 Marked by their supereminent absurdity, as Fee remarks. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 377 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 8.] EVILS FROM THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. %0a%3c %0a%3c .ZEsculapius, even after he was received as a divinity, was built %0a%3c without the City, and afterwards on an island ; 37 for this rea¬ %0a%3c son, too, it was, that when, long after the time of Cato, the %0a%3c Greeks were expelled from Italy, the physicians were not 38 %0a%3c exempted from the decree. And here I will 39 improve upon %0a%3c the foresight displayed by them. Medicine is the- only one of %0a%3c the arts of Greece, that, lucrative as it is, the Roman gravity %0a%3c has hitherto refused to cultivate. It is but very few of our %0a%3c fellow-citizens that have even attempted it, and so soon as ever %0a%3c they have done so, they have become deserters to the Greeks %0a%3c forthwith. 40 Nay, even more than this, if they attempt to treat %0a%3c of it in any other language than Greek, they are sure to lose %0a%3c all credit, with the most ignorant even, and those who do not %0a%3c understand a word of Greek; there being all the less confidence %0a%3c felt by our people in that which so nearly concerns their wel¬ %0a%3c fare, if it happens to be intelligible to them. In fact, this is %0a%3c the only one of all the arts, by Hercules! in which the moment %0a%3c a man declares 41 himself to be an adept, he is at once believed, %0a%3c there being at the same time no imposture, the results of which %0a%3c are more fraught with peril. To all this, however, we give %0a%3c no attention, so seductive is the sweet influence of the hope %0a%3c entertained of his ultimate recovery by each. %0a%3c %0a%3c And then besides, there is no law in existence whereby %0a%3c to punish the ignorance of physicians, no instance before us %0a%3c of capital punishment inflicted. It is at the expense of our %0a%3c perils that they learn, and they experimentalize by putting us %0a%3c to death, a physician being the only person that can kill an¬ %0a%3c other with sovereign impunity. Nay, even more than this, all %0a%3c the blame is thrown upon the sick man only; he is accused of %0a%3c disobedience forthwith, and it is the person who is dead and %0a%3c gone that is put upon his trial. It is the usage at Rome for %0a%3c the decuries 42 to pass examination under the censorship of the %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Formed by the river Tiber. See the Qusest.

We walk 46 with the feet of other people, %0a%3c we see with the eyes of other people, trusting to the memory of %0a%3c others we salute one another, and it is by the aid of others that %0a%3c we live. The most precious objects of existence, and the chief %0a%3c supports 47 of life, are entirely lost to us, and we have nothing %0a%3c left but our pleasures to call our own. I will not leave Cato %0a%3c exposed to the hatred of a profession so ambitious as this, nor %0a%3c yet that senate which judged as he did, but at the same time %0a%3c I will pursue my object without wresting to my purpose the %0a%3c crimes practised by its adepts, as some might naturally expect. %0a%3c For what profession has there been more fruitful in poisonings, %0a%3c or from which there have emanated more frauds upon wills ? %0a%3c And then, too, what adulteries have been committed, in the %0a%3c very houses of our princes even! the intrigue of Eudemus, 48 %0a%3c for example, with Livia, the wife of Drusus Caesar, and that of %0a%3c Yalens with the royal lady previously mentioned. 49 Let us %0a%3c not impute these evils, I say, to the art, but to the men who %0a%3c practise it; for Cato, I verily believe, as little apprehended %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c « «Inquisitio per parietes.” The reading is doubtful, but he not im¬ %0a%3c probably alludes to the employment of spies. %0a%3c %0a%3c « Hardouin thinks that he alludes to Cornelius Balbus here, a native ot %0a%3c Gades.

I will not %0a%3c mention how that cataract must be couched 51 only, in the eye, %0a%3c in preference to extracting it at once—practices, all of them, %0a%3c which have resulted in one very great advantage, by alluring %0a%3c hither such a multitude of adventurers; it being no mo¬ %0a%3c deration on their part, but the rivalry existing between such %0a%3c numbers of practitioners, that keeps their charges within mo¬ %0a%3c deration. It is a well-known fact that Charmis, the phy¬ %0a%3c sician 82 already mentioned, made a bargain with a patient of %0a%3c his in the provinces, that he should have two hundred thousand %0a%3c sesterces for the cure; that the Emperor Claudius extorted %0a%3c from Alcon, the surgeon, 83 ten millions of sesterces by way of %0a%3c tine; and that the same man, after being recalled from his %0a%3c exile in Gaul, acquired a sum equally large in the course of a %0a%3c few years. %0a%3c %0a%3c These are faults, however, which must be imputed to in¬ %0a%3c dividuals only; and it is not my intention to waste reproof %0a%3c upon the dregs of the medical profession, or to call attention to %0a%3c the ignorance , displayed by that crew, 54 the violation of all %0a%3c regimen in their treatment of disease, the evasions practised in %0a%3c the use of warm baths, the strict diet they imperiously pre¬ %0a%3c scribe, the food that is crammed into these same patients, %0a%3c exhausted as they are, several times a day; together with a %0a%3c thousand other methods of showing how quick they are to %0a%3c change their mind, their precepts for the regulation of the %0a%3c kitchen, and their recipes for the composition of unguents, %0a%3c it being one grand object with them to lose sight of none %0a%3c of the usual incitements to sensuality. The importation of %0a%3c foreign merchandize, and the introduction of tariffs settled by %0a%3c foreigners, 85 would have been highly displeasing to our ances- %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Nothing could possibly be more remote from bis republican notious, %0a%3c than “ regiuse ” at Rome. %0a%3c %0a%3c 81 “Emovendam.” In order that a future job may be ensured. %0a%3c %0a%3c 82 Inc. 5 of this Book. 53 “ Vulnerum medico.” %0a%3c %0a%3c “ “.Ejus tuibae.” 65 See B. xxiv. c. 1. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 3B0 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c tors, I can readily imagine; but it was not these inconveni- %0a%3c ences that Cato had in view, when he spoke thus strongly in %0a%3c condemnation of the medical art. %0a%3c %0a%3c “Theriace” 56 is the name given to a preparation devised by %0a%3c luxury; a composition formed of six hundred 51 different in¬ %0a%3c gredients ; and this while Nature has bestowed upon us such %0a%3c numbers of remedies, each of which would have fully answered %0a%3c the purpose employed by itself! The Mithridatic 58 antidote %0a%3c is composed of four and fifty ingredients, none of which are %0a%3c used in exactly the same proportion, and the quantity pre¬ %0a%3c scribed is in some cases so small as the sixtieth part of one %0a%3c denarius! Which of the gods, pray, can have instructed man %0a%3c in such trickery as this, a height to which the mere subtlety %0a%3c of human invention could surely never have reached? It %0a%3c clearly must emanate from a vain ostentation of scientific skill, %0a%3c and must be set down as a monstrous system of puffing off the %0a%3c medical art. %0a%3c %0a%3c And yet, after all, the physicians themselves do not under¬ %0a%3c stand this branch of their profession; and I have ascertained %0a%3c that it is a common thing for them to put mineral vermilion" %0a%3c in their medicines, a rank poison, as I shall have occasion 60 to %0a%3c show when I come to speak of the pigments, in place of Indian %0a%3c cinnabar, and all because they mistake the name of the one %0a%3c drug for that of the other! These, however, are errors which %0a%3c only concern the health of individuals, while it is the practices %0a%3c which Cato foresaw and dreaded, less dangerous in themselves %0a%3c and little regarded, practices, in fact, which the leading men %0a%3c in the art do not hesitate to avow, that have wrought 61 the %0a%3c corruption of the manners of our empire. %0a%3c %0a%3c The practices I allude to are those to which, while enjoying %0a%3c robust health, we submit: such, for instance, as rubbing the body %0a%3c with wax and oil, 63 a preparation for a wrestling match, by %0a%3c rights, but which, these men pretend, was invented as a preser¬ %0a%3c vative of health; the use of hot baths, which are necessary, %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 The origin of our word “ treacle.” See B. xx. c. 100, and Note 97. %0a%3c %0a%3c 37 Used as a round number, like our expression “ ten thousand.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 5S See B. xxiii. c. 77, and B. xxv. c. 26. %0a%3c %0a%3c 59 “ Minium.” This red lead had the name of “ cinnabaris nativa,” %0a%3c whence the error. 60 In B. xxxiii. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 As tending to effeminacy, or undermining the constitution. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 See B. xxviii. c. 13. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 381 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Ohap. 9.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOOL. %0a%3c %0a%3c they have persuaded us, for the proper digestion of the food, %0a%3c baths which no one ever leaves without being all the weaker %0a%3c for it, and from which the more submissive of their patients %0a%3c are only carried to the tomb; potions taken fasting ; vomits to %0a%3c clear the stomach, and then a series of fresh drenchiDgs with %0a%3c drink; emasculation, self-inflicted by the use of pitch-plasters %0a%3c as depilatories ; the public exposure, too, of even the most de¬ %0a%3c licate parts of the female body for the prosecution of these %0a%3c practices. Most assuredly so it is, the contagion which has %0a%3c seized upon the public morals, has had no more fertile source %0a%3c than the medical art, and it continues, day by day even, to %0a%3c justify the claims of Cato to be considered a prophet and an %0a%3c oracle of wisdom, in that assertion of his, that it is quite suffi¬ %0a%3c cient to dip into the records of Greek genius, without becoming %0a%3c tborougidy acquainted with them. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such then is what may be said in justification of the senate %0a%3c and of the ltoman people, during that period of six hundred %0a%3c years in which they manifested such repugnance to an art, by %0a%3c the most insidious terms of which, good men are made to lend %0a%3c their credit and authority to the very worst, and so strongly %0a%3c entered their protest against the silly persuasions entertained by %0a%3c those, who fancy that nothing can benefit them but what is %0a%3c coupled with high price. * %0a%3c %0a%3c I entertain no doubt, too, that there will be found some to ex¬ %0a%3c press their disgust at the particulars which I am about to give, in %0a%3c relation to animals: and yet Virgil himself has not disdained %0a%3c —when, too, there was no necessity for his doing so—to speak %0a%3c of ants and weevils, %0a%3c %0a%3c “ And nests by beetles made that shun the light.” 63 %0a%3c %0a%3c Homer, 61 too, amid his description of the battles of the gods, %0a%3c has not disdained to remark upon the voracity of the common %0a%3c Hy; nor has Vature, she who engender^, man, thought it beneath %0a%3c her to engender these insects as well. Let each then make it %0a%3c his care, not so much to regard the thing itself, as to rightly %0a%3c appreciate in each case the cause and its effects. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 9.

I should %0a%3c not have been at a loss for high-flown language with which to %0a%3c grace my narrative, had I made it my design to regard any¬ %0a%3c thing else than what, as being strictly trustworthy, 65 becomes %0a%3c my work : for among the very first remedies mentioned, we %0a%3c find those said to be derived from the ashes and nest of the %0a%3c phoenix, 66 as though, forsooth, its existence were a well ascer¬ %0a%3c tained fact, and not altogether a fable. And then besides, it %0a%3c would be a mere mockery to describe remedies that can only %0a%3c return to us once in a thousand years. %0a%3c %0a%3c (2.) The ancient Romans attributed to wool a degree of reli¬ %0a%3c gious importance even, and it was in this spirit that they enjoined %0a%3c that the bride should touch the door-posts of her husband’s %0a%3c house with wool. In addition to dress and protection from the %0a%3c cold, wool, in an unwashed state, used in combination with oil, %0a%3c and wine or vinegar, supplies us with numerous remedies, accord¬ %0a%3c ing as we stand in need of an emollient or an excitant, an astrin¬ %0a%3c gent or a laxative. "Wetted from time to time with these liquids, %0a%3c greasy wool is applied to sprained limbs, and to sinews that are %0a%3c suffering from pain. In the case of sprains, some persons are %0a%3c in the habit of adding salt, while others, again, apply pounded %0a%3c rue and grease, in wool : the same, too, in the case of con¬ %0a%3c tusions or tumours. Wool will improve the breath, it is said, %0a%3c if the teeth and gums are rubbed with it, mixed with honey; %0a%3c it is very good, too, for phrenitis, 67 used as a fumigation. To %0a%3c arrest bleeding at the nose, wool is introduced into the nostrils %0a%3c with oil of roses; or it is used in another manner, the ears %0a%3c being well plugged with it. In the case of inveterate ulcers it is %0a%3c applied topically with honey : soaked in wine or vinegar, or %0a%3c in cold water and oil, and then squeezed out, it is used for %0a%3c the cure of wounds. %0a%3c %0a%3c Rams’ wool, washed in cold water, and steeped in oil, is %0a%3c used for female complaints, and to allay inflammations of the %0a%3c uterus. Procidence of the uterus is reduced by using this wool %0a%3c %0a%3c 65 He certainly does not always keep this object in view. %0a%3c %0a%3c 66 See B. x. c. 2, and B. xii. c. 42. %0a%3c %0a%3c 67 A form of fever, Littre remarks, that is known by the moderns as %0a%3c “ pseudo-continuous.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 10.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM WOOL-GREASE. 383 %0a%3c %0a%3c in the form of a fumigation. Greasy wool, used as a plaster %0a%3c and as a pessary, brings away the dead foetus, and arrests %0a%3c uterine discharges. Bites inflicted by a mad dog are plugged %0a%3c with unwashed wool, the application being removed at the end %0a%3c of seven days. Applied with cold water, it is a cure for %0a%3c agnails: steeped in a mixture of boiling nitre, sulphur, oil, %0a%3c v?negar, and tar, and applied twice a day, as warm as possible, %0a%3c it allays pains in the loins. By making ligatures with un¬ %0a%3c washed rams’ wool about the extremities of the limbs, bleed¬ %0a%3c ing is effectually stopped. ' %0a%3c %0a%3c In all cases, the wool most esteemed is that from the neck of %0a%3c the animal; the best kinds of wool being those of Galatia, %0a%3c Tarentum, Attica, and Miletus. For excoriations, blows, %0a%3c bruises, contusions, crushes, galls, falls, pains in the head and %0a%3c other parts, and for inflammation of the stomach, unwashed %0a%3c wool is applied, with a mixture of vinegar and oil of roses. %0a%3c Reduced to ashes, it is applied to contusions, wounds, and %0a%3c burns, and forms an ingredient in ophthalmic compositions. It %0a%3c is employed, also, for fistulas and suppurations of the ears. %0a%3c For this last purpose, some persons take the wool as it is shorn, %0a%3c while others pluck it from the fleece; they then cut off the %0a%3c ends of it, and after drying and carding it, lay it in pots of %0a%3c unbaked earth, steep it well in honey, and burn it. Others, %0a%3c again, arrange it in layers alternately with chips of torch- %0a%3c pine, 68 and, after sprinkling it with oil, set fire to it: they %0a%3c then rub the ashes into small vessels with the hands, aDd let %0a%3c them settle in water there. This operation is repeated and the %0a%3c water changed several times, until at last the ashes are found %0a%3c to be slightly astringent, without the slightest pungency; upon %0a%3c which, they are put by for use, being possessed of certain %0a%3c caustic properties, 69 and extremely useful as a detergent for %0a%3c the eyelids. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. “"THIRTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIYED FROM WOOL-GREASE. %0a%3c %0a%3c And not only this, but the filthy excretions even of sheep, %0a%3c the sweat adhering to the wool of the flanks and of the %0a%3c axillary concavities—a substance known as “ oesypum ’' are %0a%3c %0a%3c 6? “ Smectica ” is suggested by Gesner, Hist.

There %0a%3c are numerous ways of obtaining it, but the most approved %0a%3c method is to take the wool, fresh clipped from those parts of %0a%3c the body, or else the sweat and grease collected from any part of %0a%3c the fleece, and boil it gently in a copper vessel upon a slow fire: %0a%3c this done, it is left to cool, and the fat which floats upon the %0a%3c surface collected into an earthen vessel. The material originally %0a%3c used is then subjected to another boiling, and the two results %0a%3c are washed in cold water; after which, they are strained %0a%3c through a linen cloth and exposed to the sun till they become %0a%3c bleached and quite transparent, and are then put by in a pew¬ %0a%3c ter box for keeping. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best proof of its genuineness is its retention of the %0a%3c strong smell of the original grease, and its not melting when %0a%3c rubbed with water upon the hand, but turning white, like %0a%3c white-lead in appearance. This substance is extremely use¬ %0a%3c ful for inflammations of the eyes and indurations of the eye¬ %0a%3c lids. Some persons bake the wool in an earthen pot, until it %0a%3c has lost all its grease, and are of opinion that, prepared this %0a%3c way, it is a more useful remedy for excoriations and indurations %0a%3c of the eyelids, for eruptions at the corners of the eyes, and for %0a%3c watery eyes. And not only does this grease heal ulcerations %0a%3c of the eyes, but, mixed with goose-grease, of the ears and %0a%3c generative organs as well; in combination also with melilote %0a%3c and butter, it is a cure for inflammations of the uterus, and for %0a%3c excoriations of the rectum and condylomata. The other uses %0a%3c to which it is applied, we shall detail on a more appropriate %0a%3c occasion. %0a%3c %0a%3c The grease, too, of the wool about the tail is made up into %0a%3c pills, unmixed with any substance : these pills are dried and %0a%3c pulverized, being an excellent application for the teeth, when %0a%3c loose even, and for the gums, when attacked by spreading ulcers %0a%3c of a cancerous nature. Sheep’s wool, too, cleaned, is applied %0a%3c by itself, or with the addition of sulphur, for dull, heavy pains, %0a%3c and the ashes of it, burnt, are used for diseases of the genera¬ %0a%3c tive organs: indeed, this wool is possessed of such sovereign %0a%3c virtues, that it is used as a covering for medicinal applications %0a%3c even. It is also an especial remedy for the sheep itself, when %0a%3c it has lost its stomach, and refuses to feed ; for, upon plucking %0a%3c some wool from the tail, and then tying the tail therewith, as %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM EGGS. 385 %0a%3c %0a%3c tight as possible, the sheep will fall to feeding immediately.

(3.)-TWENTY-TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM EGGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a considerable affinity also between wool and eggs, %0a%3c which are applied together as a frontal to the forehead by way %0a%3c of cure for defluxions of the eyes. Wool, however, is not %0a%3c required for this purpose to have been dressed with radicula, 11 %0a%3c the only thing requisite to be combined with it being the %0a%3c white of an egg and powdered frankincense. The white of an %0a%3c egg, also applied by itself, arrests defluxions of the eyes, and has %0a%3c a cooling effect upon inflammations of those organs : some, how¬ %0a%3c ever, prefer mixing saffron with it, and employ it as an ingre¬ %0a%3c dient in eye-salves, in place of water. For ophthalmia in infants %0a%3c there is hardly any remedy to be found, except white of egg %0a%3c mixed with fresh butter. Eggs beaten up with oil, are very %0a%3c soothing for erysipelas, beet leaves being laid on the liniment. %0a%3c %0a%3c White of egg, mixed with pounded gum ammoniac, is used %0a%3c as a bandoline for arranging the hairs of the eyelids ; and, in %0a%3c combination with pine-nuts and a little honey, it forms a %0a%3c liniment for the removal of pimples on the face. If the face %0a%3c is well rubbed with it, it will never be sun-burnt. If, the %0a%3c moment the flesh has been scalded, an egg is applied, no blis¬ %0a%3c ters will form : some persons, however, mix with it barley- %0a%3c meal and a little salt. In cases of ulceration formed by burns, %0a%3c there is nothing better than parched barley and hogs’ lard, %0a%3c mixed with the white of an egg. The same mixture is also %0a%3c used as an application for diseases of the rectum, in infants %0a%3c even, and in cases, too, when there is procidence of those parts. %0a%3c For the cure of chaps upon the feet, white of eggs is boiled, %0a%3c with two denarii of white lead, an equal quantity of litharge, %0a%3c a little myrrh, and some wine. For the cure of erysipelas they %0a%3c use the whites of three eggs with amylum: 72 it is said, too, %0a%3c that white of egg has the effect of knitting wounds and of %0a%3c expelling urinary calculi. The yolk of eggs boiled hard, %0a%3c applied in woman’s milk with a little saffron and honey, has %0a%3c a soothing effect upon pains in the eyes. The yolk is applied %0a%3c also to the eyes in wool, mixed with honied wine and oil of %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 See B. xix. c. 1, B. xxiv. c 58, and B. xxv. c. 21. %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 See B. xviii. c. 17. %0a%3c %0a%3c VOL. v. c C %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 386 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c roses ; or else mixed with ground parsley-seed and polenta, and %0a%3c applied with honied wine.

It is used, too, both internally and ex¬ %0a%3c ternally, in a raw state, as a sovereign cure for the sting of the %0a%3c hsemorrho'is ; 13 and it is highly beneficial for the kidneys, for %0a%3c irritations and ulcerations of the bladder, and for bloody expec¬ %0a%3c torations. For dysentery, the yolks of five eggs are taken raw %0a%3c in one semi-sextarius of wine, mixed with the ashes of the shells, %0a%3c poppy-juice, and wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c For cceliac fluxes, it is recommended to take the yolks of %0a%3c eggs, with like proportions of pulpy raisins and pomegranate %0a%3c rind, in equal quantities, for three consecutive days; or else %0a%3c to follow another method, and take the yolks of three eggs, %0a%3c with three ounces of old bacon and honey, and three cyathi of %0a%3c old wine; the whole being beaten up to the consistency of %0a%3c honey, and taken in water, when needed, in pieces the size of %0a%3c a hazel nut. In some cases, too, the yolks of three eggs are %0a%3c fried in oil, the whole of the egg having been steeped a day %0a%3c previously in vinegar. It is in this way that eggs are used for %0a%3c the treatment of spleen diseases; but for spitting of blood, they %0a%3c should be taken with three cyathi of must. Yolk of egg is used, %0a%3c too, for the cure of bruises of long standing, in combination %0a%3c with bulbs and honey. Boiled and taken in wine, yolks of %0a%3c eggs arrest menstruation : applied raw with oil or wine, they %0a%3c dispel inflations of the uterus. Mixed with goose-grease and %0a%3c oil of roses, they are useful for crick in the neck; and they %0a%3c are hardened over the fire, and applied warm, for the cure of %0a%3c maladies of the rectum. For condylomata, eggs are used in %0a%3c combination with oil of roses; and for the treatment of burns, %0a%3c they are hardened in water, and set upon hot coals till the %0a%3c shells are burnt, the yellow being used as a liniment with oil %0a%3c of roses. %0a%3c %0a%3c Eggs become entirely transformed into yolk, on being re¬ %0a%3c moved after the hen has sat upon them for three days; in %0a%3c w r hich state they are known by the name of “ sitista .” 71 The %0a%3c chicks that are found within the shell are used for strengthen- %0a%3c %0a%3c 73 See B. xx. c. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c 74 Hermolaiis suggests “schista,” “divided,” and Dalechamps proposes %0a%3c “synchyta,” “ mixed.” The reading is very doubtful. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 11] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c REMEDIES DEBITED FROM EGGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 387 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ing a disordered stomach, being eaten with half a nut-gall, %0a%3c and no other food taken for the next two hours. They are %0a%3c given also for dysentery, boiled in the egg with one semi-sexta- %0a%3c riuS of astringent wine, and an equal quantity of olive oil and %0a%3c polenta. The pellicle that lines the shell is used, either raw %0a%3c or boiled, for the.cure of cracked lips; and the shell itself, %0a%3c reduced to ashes, is taken in wine for discharges of blood : care %0a%3c must be taken, however, to burn it without the pellicle. In %0a%3c the same way, too, a dentifrice is prepared. The ashes of the %0a%3c shell, applied topically with myrrh, arrest menstruation when %0a%3c in excess. So remarkably strong is the shell of an egg, that %0a%3c if it is set upright, no force or weight can break it, unless a %0a%3c slight inclination be made to one side or other of the circum¬ %0a%3c ference. Eggs taken whole in wine, with rue, dill, and cum¬ %0a%3c min, facilitate parturition. Used with oil and cedar-resin, %0a%3c they remove itch and prurigo, and, applied in combination with %0a%3c cyclaminos , 75 they are remedial for running ulcers of the head. %0a%3c Tor purulent expectorations and spitting of blood, a raw egg %0a%3c is taken, warmed with juice of cut-leek and an equal quantity %0a%3c of Greek honey. For coughs, eggs are administered, boiled %0a%3c and beaten up with honey, or else raw, with raisin wine and an %0a%3c equal quantity of olive oil. For diseases of the male organs, %0a%3c an injection is made, of an egg, three cyathi of raisin wine, %0a%3c and half an ounce of amylum , 16 the mixture being used imme¬ %0a%3c diately after the bath. Where injuries have been inflicted by %0a%3c serpents, boiled eggs are used as a liniment, beaten up with %0a%3c nasturtium. %0a%3c %0a%3c In what various ways eggs are used as food is well known %0a%3c to all, passing downwards, however swollen the throat may %0a%3c be, and warming the parts as they pass. Eggs, too, are the %0a%3c only diet which, while it affords nutriment in sickness, does %0a%3c not load the stomach, possessing at the same moment all the %0a%3c advantages both of food and drink. We have already 77 stated, %0a%3c that the shell of an egg becomes soft when steeped in vinegar : %0a%3c it is by the aid of eggs thus prepared, and kneaded up with %0a%3c meal, into bread, that patients suffering from the coeliac flux %0a%3c are often restored to strength. Some, however, think it a better %0a%3c plan to roast the eggs, when thus softened, in a shallow pan ; %0a%3c a method, by the aid of which, they arrest not only looseness of. %0a%3c %0a%3c 75 Or Sowbread.

In cases, %0a%3c again, where the discharges are greatly in excess, eggs are %0a%3c taken raw, with meal, in water. The yolks, too, are employed %0a%3c alone, boiled hard in vinegar and roasted with ground pepper, %0a%3c when wanted to arrest diarrhoea. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tor dysentery, there is a sovereign remedy, prepared in the %0a%3c following manner: an egg is emptied into a new earthen vessel, %0a%3c which done, in order that all the proportions may be equal, %0a%3c fill the shell, first with honey, then with oil, and then with %0a%3c vinegar; beat them up together, and thoroughly incorporate %0a%3c them : the better the quality of the several ingredients, the %0a%3c more efficacious the mixture will be. Others, again, instead %0a%3c of oil and vinegar, use the same proportions of red resin and %0a%3c wine. There is also another way of making up this prepara¬ %0a%3c tion : the proportion of oil, and of that only, remains the same, %0a%3c and to it they add two sixtieth parts of a denarius of the %0a%3c vegetable which we have spoken of under the name of “rhus ,” 18 %0a%3c and five oboli of honey. All these ingredients are boiled down %0a%3c together, and no food is eaten by the patient till the end of %0a%3c four hours after taking the mixture. Many persons, too, have %0a%3c a cure for griping pains in the bowels, by beating up two eggs %0a%3c with four cloves of garlick, and administering them, warmed %0a%3c in one semi-sextarius of wine. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not to omit anything in commendation of eggs, I would %0a%3c here add that glair of egg, mixed with quicklime, unites %0a%3c broken 79 glass. Indeed, so great is the efficacy of the substance %0a%3c of an egg, that wood dipped in it will not take fire, and cloth %0a%3c with which it has come in contact will not ignite . 80 On this %0a%3c occasion, however, it is only of the eggs of poultry that I have %0a%3c been speaking, though those of the various other birds as well %0a%3c are possessed of many useful properties, as I shall have to %0a%3c mention on the appropriate occasions. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 12. — SERPENTS* EGGS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to the above, there is another kind of egg , 81 held %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 See B. xxiv. c. 54. %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 This is the fact, and it is similarly used for mending china.

In summer 82 time, num¬ %0a%3c berless snakes become artificially entwined together, and form %0a%3c rings around their bodies with the viscous slime which exudes %0a%3c from their mouths, and with the foam secreted by them : the %0a%3c name given to this substance is “ anguinum .” 83 The Druids %0a%3c tell us, that the serpents eject these eggs into the air by their %0a%3c hissing , 84 and that a person must be read)' to catch them in a %0a%3c cloak, so as not to let them touch the ground; they say also that he %0a%3c must instantly take to flight on horseback, as the serpents will %0a%3c be sure to pursue him, until some intervening river has placed %0a%3c a barrier between them. The test of its genuineness, they say, %0a%3c is its floating against the current of a stream, even though it %0a%3c be set in gold. But, as it is the way with magicians to be %0a%3c dexterous and cunning in casting a veil about their frauds, they %0a%3c pretend that these eggs can only be taken on a certain day of %0a%3c the moon; as though, forsooth, it depended entirely upon the %0a%3c human will to make the moon and the serpents accord as to %0a%3c the moment of this operation. %0a%3c %0a%3c I myself, however, have seen one of these eggs: it was %0a%3c round, and about as large as an apple of moderate size; the %0a%3c shell 65 of it was formed of a cartilaginous substance, and it was %0a%3c surrounded with numerous cupules, as it were, resembling %0a%3c those upon the arms of the polypus : it is held in high estimation %0a%3c %0a%3c tbe name of Glain naidr, or “ the Adder gem.” Mr. Luyd (in Rowland’s %0a%3c Mona Antiqua, p. 342) says that the genuine Ovum anguinum can be no %0a%3c other than a shell of the kind called echinus marinus, and that Dr. Borlase %0a%3c observes that, instead of the natural anguinum , artificial rings of stone, %0a%3c glass, and sometimes baked clay, were substituted as of equal validity. %0a%3c The belief in these charms very recently existed in Cornwall and Wales, if %0a%3c indeed it does not at the present day. The subject is very fully discussed in %0a%3c Brand’s Popular Antiquities, Vol. III. p. 286, et seq., and p. 369, et seq., %0a%3c Bohn's Edition. These gems and beads are not uncommonly found in tumuli %0a%3c of the early British period. %0a%3c %0a%3c 8 - A similar belief in its origin was prevalent in Cornwall and Wales, %0a%3c and whoever found it was supposed to ensure success in all his undertakings. %0a%3c %0a%3c 83 “The snake’s egg”— ovum being understood. %0a%3c %0a%3c el “ The vulgar opinion in Cornwall and most parts of Wales is that these %0a%3c are produced through all Cornwall by snakes joining their heads together %0a%3c and hissing, which forms a kind of bubble like a ring about the head of %0a%3c one of them, which the rest, by continual hissing, blow on till it comes off %0a%3c at the tail, when it immediately hardens and resembles a glass ring.”— %0a%3c Gough's Camden, Vol. II. p. 571, Ed. 1789. %0a%3c %0a%3c 85 The shell of a sea urchin most probably.

It is this entwining of serpents with one another, and %0a%3c the fruitful results of this unison, that seem to me to have %0a%3c given rise to the usage among foreign nations, of surrounding %0a%3c the caduceus 88 with representations of serpents, as so many %0a%3c symbols of peace—it must be remembered, too, that on the %0a%3c caduceus, serpents are never 89 represented as having crests. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 13 . —THE METHOD OF PREPARING COMMAGENUM.

A young whelp, too, is sacrificed to %0a%3c Genita Mana ; 4 and, at the repasts celebrated in honour of the %0a%3c gods, it is still the usage to set whelps’ flesh on table; at the %0a%3c inaugural feasts, too, of the pontiffs, this dish was in com¬ %0a%3c mon use, as we learn from the Comedies 5 of Plautus.

The flesh of this last, preserved in salt, is given, in %0a%3c doses of one denarius, in three cyathi of drink to persons who %0a%3c have been stung by serpents : or else the maw of the animal is %0a%3c stuffed with coriander seed and dried, to be taken for the same %0a%3c purpose in wine.

Thus the bug, for instance, a most filthy %0a%3c insect, and one the very name of which inspires us with loath¬ %0a%3c ing, is said to be a neutralizer of the venom of serpents, asps in %0a%3c particular, and to be a preservative against all kinds of poisons. %0a%3c As a proof of this, they tell us that the sting of an asp is never %0a%3c fatal to poultry, if they have eaten bugs that day; and that, %0a%3c if such is the case, their flesh is remarkably beneficial to persons %0a%3c who have been stung by serpents. Of the various recipes 12 %0a%3c given in reference to these insects, the least revolting are the %0a%3c application of them externally to the wound, with the blood of %0a%3c a tortoise ; the employment of them as a fumigation to make %0a%3c leeches loose their hold; and the administering of them to ani¬ %0a%3c mals in drink when a leech has been accidentally swallowed. %0a%3c Some persons, however, go so far as to crush bugs with salt %0a%3c and woman’s milk, and anoint the eyes with the mixture ; in %0a%3c combination, too, with honey and oil of roses, they use them %0a%3c as an injection for the ears. Field-bugs, again, and those found %0a%3c upon the mallow , 13 are burnt, and the ashes mixed with oil %0a%3c of roses as an injection for the ears. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the other remedial virtues attributed to bugs, for the %0a%3c cure of vomiting, quartan fevers, and other diseases, although %0a%3c we find recommendations given to swallow them in an egg, %0a%3c some wax, or in a bean, I look upon them as utterly unfounded, %0a%3c and not worthy of further notice. They are employed, how¬ %0a%3c ever, for the treatment of lethargy, and with some fair reason, %0a%3c as they successfully neutralize the narcotic effects of the poison %0a%3c of the asp : for this purpose seven of them are administered %0a%3c in a cyathus of w r ater, but in the case of children only four. %0a%3c In cases, too, of strangury, they have been iujected into the %0a%3c urinary channel : 14 so true it is that Nature, that universal %0a%3c parent, has engendered nothing without some powerful reason %0a%3c or other. In addition to these particulars, a couple of bugs, %0a%3c %0a%3c 12 Guettard, a French commentator on Pliny, recommends bugs to be %0a%3c taken internally for hysteria! %0a%3c %0a%3c 13 Perhaps the Cimex pratensis is meant here. Neither this nor the %0a%3c Cimex juniperinus, the Cimex brassicae, or the Lygaeus hyoscami has the %0a%3c offensive smell of the house bug. %0a%3c %0a%3c 14 An excellent method, Ajasson remarks, of adding to the tortures of %0a%3c the patient. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 394 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXTX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c it is said, attached to the left arm in some wool that has been %0a%3c stolen from the shepherds, will effectually cure nocturnal fevers; %0a%3c while those recurrent in the daytime may be treated with %0a%3c equal success by enclosing the bugs in a piece of russet-coloured %0a%3c cloth. The scolopendra, on the other hand, is a great enemy %0a%3c to these insects; used in the form of a fumigation, it kills %0a%3c them. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18.-PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE ASP. %0a%3c %0a%3c The sting of the asp takes deadly effect by causing torpor %0a%3c and drowsiness. Of all serpents, injuries inflicted by the asp %0a%3c are the most incurable ; and their venom, if it comes in contact %0a%3c with the blood or a recent wound, produces instantaneous death. %0a%3c If, on the other hand, it touches an old sore, its fatal effects %0a%3c are not so immediate. Taken internally, in however large a %0a%3c quantity, the venom is not injurious , 15 as it has no corrosive pro¬ %0a%3c perties ; for which reason it is that the flesh of animals killed %0a%3c by it may be eaten with impunity. %0a%3c %0a%3c I should hesitate in giving circulation to a prescription for %0a%3c injuries inflicted by the asp, were it not that M. Yarro, then %0a%3c in the eighty-third year of his age, has left a statement to the %0a%3c effect that it is a most efficient remedy for wounds inflicted by %0a%3c this reptile, for the person stung to drink his own urine. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 19. -REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE BASILISK. %0a%3c %0a%3c As to the basilisk , 16 a creature which the very serpents fly %0a%3c from, which kills by its odour even, and which proves fatal to %0a%3c man by only looking upon him, its blood has been marvel¬ %0a%3c lously extolled by the magicians . 17 This blood is thick and %0a%3c adhesive, like pitch, which it resembles also in colour: dis¬ %0a%3c solved in water, they say, it becomes of a brighter red than %0a%3c that of cinnabar. They attribute to it also the property of %0a%3c ensuring success to petitions preferred to potentates, and to %0a%3c prayers even offered to the gods; and they regard it as a %0a%3c remedy for various diseases, and as an amulet preservative %0a%3c against all noxious spells. Some give it the name of “ Saturn’s %0a%3c blood.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 This is the fact. 15 See B. viii. c. 33. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 The Magi of the East, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Cbap. 21.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM THE TIPER. 395 %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20.-RKME.DIES DERIVED FROM THE DRAGON. %0a%3c %0a%3c The dragon 18 is a serpent destitute of venom. Its head, %0a%3c placed beneath the threshold of a door, the gods being duly- %0a%3c propitiated by prayers, will ensure good fortune to the house, %0a%3c it is said. Its eyes, dried and beaten up with honey, form a %0a%3c liniment which is an effectual preservative against the terrors %0a%3c of spectres by night, in the case of the most timorous even. %0a%3c The fat adhering to the heart, attached to the arm with a %0a%3c deer’s sinews in the skin of a gazelle, will ensure success in %0a%3c law-suits, it is said; and the first joint of the vertebrae will %0a%3c secure an easy access to persons high in office. The teeth, %0a%3c attached to the body with a deer’s sinews in the skin of a roe¬ %0a%3c buck, have the effect of rendering masters indulgent and poten¬ %0a%3c tates gracious, it is said. %0a%3c %0a%3c But the most remarkable thing of all is a composition, by %0a%3c the aid of which the lying magicians profess to render persons %0a%3c invincible. They take the tail and head of a dragon, the hairs %0a%3c of a lion’s forehead with the marrow of that animal, the foam %0a%3c of a horse that has won a race, and the claws of a dog’s feet: %0a%3c these they tie up together in a deer’s skin, and fasten them %0a%3c alternately with the sinews of a deer and a gazelle. It is, %0a%3c however, no better worth our while to refute such pretensions %0a%3c as these, than it would be to describe the alleged remedies for %0a%3c injuries inflicted by serpents, seeing that all these contrivances %0a%3c are so many evil devices to poison 19 men’s morals. %0a%3c %0a%3c Dragon’s fat will repel venomous creatures ; an effect which is %0a%3c equally produced by burning the fat of the ichneumon . 20 They %0a%3c will take to flight, also, at the approach of a person who has %0a%3c been rubbed with nettles bruised in vinegar. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 21.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VIPER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The application of a viper’s head, even if it be not the one %0a%3c that has inflicted the wound, is of infinite utility as a remedy". %0a%3c It is highly advantageous, too, to hold the viper that inflicted %0a%3c the injury on the end of a stick, over the steam of boiling %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 Some serpent of the boa species, probably.

The %0a%3c ashes, also, of the viper, are considered very useful, employed as %0a%3c a liniment for the wound. According to what Xigidius tells %0a%3c us, serpents are compelled, by a sort of natural instinct, to %0a%3c return to the person who has been stung by them. The people %0a%3c of Scythia split the viper’s head between the ears, in order to %0a%3c extract a small stone , 22 which it swallows in its alarm, th**y %0a%3c say : others, again, use the head entire. %0a%3c %0a%3c From the viper are prepared those tablets which are known %0a%3c as “ theriaci ” 24 to the Greeks : for this purpose the animal is %0a%3c cut away three fingers’ length from both the head and the tail, %0a%3c after which the intestines are removed and the livid vein ad¬ %0a%3c hering to the back-bone. The rest of the body is then boiled %0a%3c in a shallow pan, in water seasoned with dill, and the bones are %0a%3c taken out, and fine wheaten flour added; after which the %0a%3c preparation is made up into tablets , 24 which are dried in the %0a%3c shade and are employed as an ingredient in numerous medica¬ %0a%3c ments. I should remark, however, that this preparation, it %0a%3c would appear, can only be made from the viper. Some per¬ %0a%3c sons, after cleansing the viper in manner above described, boil %0a%3c down the fat, with one sextarius of olive oil, to one half. Of %0a%3c this preparation, when needed, three drops are added to some %0a%3c oil, with which mixture the body is rubbed, to repel the %0a%3c approach of all kinds of noxious animals. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22 . —REMEDIES DERIVED PROM THE ofHER SERPENTS. %0a%3c %0a%3c In addition to these particulars, it is a well-known fact that %0a%3c for all injuries inflicted by serpents, and those even of an %0a%3c otherwise incurable nature, it is an excellent remedy to apply %0a%3c the entrails of the serpent itself to the wound ; as also, that %0a%3c persons who have once swallowed a viper’s liver, boiled, will %0a%3c never afterwards be attacked by serpents. The snake, too, %0a%3c is not venomous, except, indeed, upon certain days of the %0a%3c month when it is irritated by the action of the moon: it is a %0a%3c very useful plan to take it alive, and pound it in water, the %0a%3c wound inflicted by it being fomented with the preparation. %0a%3c Indeed, it is generally supposed that this reptile is possessed of %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 This is perhaps the meaning of “ praecanere.” Sillig suggests “re- %0a%3c canere.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 Which was said to act as an antidote to the poison, applied to the %0a%3c wound. %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 “ Antidotes to serpents’poison.” 21 “Pastilli.” %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 23.] REMEDIES DEBITED FROM TIIE SALAMANDER. 397 %0a%3c %0a%3c numerous other remedial properties, as we shall have occasion %0a%3c more fully to mention from time to time: hence it is that the %0a%3c snake is consecrated to JEsculapius . 25 As for Democritus, he %0a%3c has given some monstrous preparations from snakes, by the aid %0a%3c of which the language of birds, he says, may be understood . 26 %0a%3c %0a%3c The iEsculapian snake was first brought to Rome from %0a%3c Epidaurus,*' but at the present day it is very commonly reared %0a%3c in our houses 28 even ; so much so, indeed, that if the breed %0a%3c were not kept down by the frequent conflagrations, it would %0a%3c be impossible to make head against the rapid increase of them. %0a%3c But the most beautiful of all the snakes are those which are %0a%3c of an amphibious nature. These snakes are known as %0a%3c “ hydri ,” 29 or water-snakes: in virulence their venom is in¬ %0a%3c ferior to that of no other class of serpents, and their liver is %0a%3c preserved as a remedy for the ill effects of their sting. %0a%3c %0a%3c A pounded scorpion neutralizes the venom of the spotted %0a%3c lizard . 30 From this last animal, too, there is a noxious preparation %0a%3c made; for it has been found that wine in which it has been %0a%3c drowned, covers the face of those who drink it with morphew. %0a%3c Hence it is that females, when jealous of a rival’s beauty, are %0a%3c in the habit of stifling a spotted lizard in the unguents which %0a%3c they use. In such a case, the proper remedy is yolk of egg, %0a%3c honey, and nitre. The gall of a spotted lizard, beaten up in %0a%3c water, attracts weasels, they say. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 23.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM TOE SALAMANDER. %0a%3c %0a%3c But of all venomous animals it is the salamander 31 that is %0a%3c %0a%3c M The god of Medicine. %0a%3c %0a%3c 25 A favourite reverie with the learned of the East. Dupont de Ne¬ %0a%3c mours, Ajasson informs us, has left several Essays on this subject. %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 In Peloponnesus, the principal seat of his worship. A very full %0a%3c account of his introduction, under the form of a huge serpent, into the %0a%3c city of Home, is given by Ovid, Met. B. xv. 1. 544, et seq. This took %0a%3c place b.c. 293. %0a%3c %0a%3c 58 Among the snakes that are tamed, Ajasson enumerates the Coluber %0a%3c flagelliformis of Dandin, or American coach-whip snake; the Coluber con¬ %0a%3c structor of Linnseus, or Black snake; and the Coluber viridiflavus of %0a%3c Lacepede. The ADsculapian serpent is still found in Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 Or “chersydri,” “amphibious.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 Or “ starred lizard ”—“stellio.” In reality it is not poisonous. %0a%3c %0a%3c S1 See B. x. c. 86. Some kind of starred lizard, or an eft or newt per- %0a%3c “ a ps, was thus called : but in most respects it appears to be entirely a %0a%3c fabulous animal. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 398 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c by far the most dangerous; for while other reptiles attack %0a%3c individuals only, and never kill many persons at a time—not %0a%3c to mention the fact that after stinging a human being they %0a%3c are said to die of remorse, and the earth refuses to harbour 31 %0a%3c them—the salamander is able to destroy whole nations at once, %0a%3c unless they take the proper precautions against it. For if this %0a%3c reptile happens to crawl up a tree, it infects all the fruit with %0a%3c its poison, and kills those who eat thereof by the chilling pro¬ %0a%3c perties of its venom, which in its effects is in no way different %0a%3c from aconite. Nay, even more than this, if it only touches %0a%3c with its foot the wood upon which bread is baked, or if it %0a%3c happens to fall into a well, the same fatal effects will be sure %0a%3c to ensue. The saliva, too, of this reptile, if it comes in contact %0a%3c with any part of the body, the sole of the foot even, will %0a%3c cause the hair to fall off from the whole of the body. And yet %0a%3c the salamander, highly venomous as it is, is eaten by certain %0a%3c animals, swine for example ; owing, no doubt, to that antipathy %0a%3c which prevails in the natural world. %0a%3c %0a%3c From what we find stated, it is most probable, that, next %0a%3c to the animals which eat it, the best neutralizers of the poison %0a%3c of this reptile, are, cantharides taken in drink, or a lizard eaten %0a%3c with the food ; other antidotes we have already mentioned, or %0a%3c shall notice in the appropriate place. As to what the ma¬ %0a%3c gicians 33 say, that it is proof against fire, being, as they tell us, %0a%3c the only animal that has the property of extinguishing fire, if it %0a%3c had been true, it would have been made trial of at Rome long %0a%3c before this. Sextius says that the salamander, preserved in %0a%3c honey and taken with the food, after removing the intestines, %0a%3c head, and feet, acts as an aphrodisiac: he denies also that it %0a%3c has the property of extinguishing fire. %0a%3c %0a%3c chap. 24. —remedies derived from birds for injuries ix- %0a%3c %0a%3c FLICTED BY SERPENTS. REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE VCLTURE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Among the birds that afford us remedies against serpents, it %0a%3c is the vulture that occupies the highest rank; the black vulture, %0a%3c it has been remarked, being less efficacious than the others. %0a%3c The smell of their feathers, burnt, will repel serpents, they say; %0a%3c and it has been asserted that persons who carry the heart of %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 See B ii. c. 63. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 He probably alludes to tbe Magi of Persia here, as most of the stories %0a%3c about tbe salamander appear to bear the aspect of an Eastern origin. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 25.] REMEDIES DERIVED FROM POULTRY. 399 %0a%3c %0a%3c this bird about them will be safe, not only from serpents, but %0a%3c from wild beasts as well, and will have nothing to fear from %0a%3c the attacks of robbers or from the wrath of kings. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25.-REMEDIES DERIVED FROM POULTRY. %0a%3c %0a%3c The flesh of cocks and capons, applied warm the moment it %0a%3c has been plucked from the bones, neutralizes the venom of %0a%3c serpents; and the brains, taken in wine, are productive of a %0a%3c similar effect. The people of Parthia, however, prefer apply¬ %0a%3c ing a hen’s brains to the wound. Poultry broth, too, is highly %0a%3c celebrated as a cure, and is found marvellously useful in many %0a%3c other cases. Panthers and lions will never touch persons who %0a%3c have been rubbed with it, more particularly if it has been %0a%3c flavoured with garlic. The broth that is made of an old cock %0a%3c is more relaxing to the bowels; it is very good also for chronic %0a%3c fevers, numbness of the limbs, cold shiverings and maladies of %0a%3c the joints, pains also in the head, defluxions of the eyes, %0a%3c flatulency, sickness at stomach, incipient tenesmus, liver %0a%3c complaints, diseases of the kidneys, affections of the bladder, %0a%3c indigestion, and asthma. Hence there are several recipes for %0a%3c preparing this broth ; it being most efficacious when boiled up %0a%3c with sea-cabbage , 34 salted tunny , 35 capers, parsley, the plant %0a%3c mercurialis , 36 polypodium , 37 or dill. The best plan, however, %0a%3c is to boil the cock or capon with the plants above-mentioned in %0a%3c three congii of water, down to three semi-sextarii; after which %0a%3c it should be left to cool in the open air, and given at the proper %0a%3c moment, just after an emetic has been administered. %0a%3c %0a%3c And here I must not omit to mention one marvellous fact, %0a%3c even though it bears no reference to medicine: if the flesh of %0a%3c poultry is mingled with gold 38 in a state of fusion, it will %0a%3c absorb the metal and consume it, thus showing that it acts %0a%3c as a poison upon gold. If young twigs are made up into a %0a%3c collar and put round a cock’s neck, it will never crow. %0a%3c %0a%3c 31 See B. xxii. c. 33. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 “Cybium.” See B. ix. c. 18.

They say, also, in addition to this, thatpersonswhohave %0a%3c it about them in battle will be sure to display valour. They %0a%3c describe, too, certain remedies made from the egg of this bird for %0a%3c the hair. But who, pray, has ever had the opportunity of %0a%3c seeing the egg of a horned owl, considering that it is so highly %0a%3c ominous to see the bird itsdlf ? 41 And then besides, who has %0a%3c ever thought proper to make the experiment, and upon his hair %0a%3c more particularly ? In addition to all this, the magicians go %0a%3c so far as to engage to make the hair curl by using the blood of %0a%3c the young of the horned owl. %0a%3c %0a%3c What they tell us, too, about the bat, appears to belong to %0a%3c pretty much the same class of stories : if one of these animals is %0a%3c carried alive, three times round a house, they say, and then %0a%3c nailed outside of the window with the head downwards, it will %0a%3c have all the effects of a countercharm : they assert, also, that the %0a%3c bat is a most excellent preservative for sheepfolds, being first %0a%3c carried three times round them, and then hung up by the foot %0a%3c over the lintel of the door . 42 The blood of the bat is also %0a%3c recommended by them as a sovereign remedy, in combination %0a%3c with a thistle , 43 for injuries inflicted by serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27.-REMEDIES FOR THE BITE OF THE PHALANGIDM.

Its sting is much more %0a%3c acute than that of the wasp, and it lives mostly in the vicinity %0a%3c of ovens and mills. The proper remedy is, to present before %0a%3c the eyes of the person stung another insect of the same de¬ %0a%3c scription, a purpose for which they are preserved when found %0a%3c dead. Their husks also, found in a dry state, are beaten up %0a%3c and taken in drink for a similar purpose. The young of the %0a%3c weasel, too, as already 45 stated, are possessed of a similar pro¬ %0a%3c perty. The Greeks give the name of “ phalangion” also to a %0a%3c kind of spider, but they generally distinguish it by the surname %0a%3c of the “wolf .” 46 A third kind, also known as the “phalan- %0a%3c gium,” is a spider with a hairy 47 body, and a head of enormous %0a%3c size. When opened, there are found in it two small worms, %0a%3c they say: these, attached in a piece of deer’s skin, before sun¬ %0a%3c rise, to a woman’s body, will prevent conception, according to %0a%3c what Cmcilius, in his Commentaries, says. This property lasts, %0a%3c however, for a year only ; and, indeed, it is the only one of all %0a%3c the anti-conceptives 48 that I feel myself at liberty to mention, %0a%3c in favour of some women whose fecundity, quite teeming with %0a%3c children , 48 stands in need of some such respite. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is another kind again, called “ rhagion ,” 50 similar to %0a%3c a black grape in appearance, with a very diminutive mouth, %0a%3c situate beneath the abdomen, and extremely short legs, which %0a%3c have all the appearance of not being fully developed. The bite %0a%3c of this last insect causes fully as much pain as the sting of the %0a%3c scorpion, and the urine of persons who are injured by it, pre¬ %0a%3c sents filmy appearances like cobwebs. The asterion 61 would be %0a%3c identical with it, were it not distinguished by white streaks %0a%3c upon the body : its bite causes failing in the knees. But %0a%3c worse than either of these last, is a blue spider, covered with %0a%3c black hair, and causing dimness of the sight and vomiting of %0a%3c a matter like cobwebs in appearance. A still more dangerous %0a%3c kind is one which differs only from the hornet, in form, in %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 In c. 16 of this Book. 46 44 Lupus.” See B. xi. c. 28. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4; The Tarantula has been suggested, but that is a native of Italy. %0a%3c %0a%3c 48 “ Atocium.” 49 “ Plena liberis." %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 From ’pa$, a “ grape.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 Or “starred ” spider.

The myrroecion 52 in the head %0a%3c resembles the ant, has a black body spotted with white, and %0a%3c causes by its bite a pain like that attendant upon the stiDg of %0a%3c the wasp. Of the tetragnathius 43 there are two varieties, the %0a%3c more noxious of which has two white streaks crossing each %0a%3c other on the middle of the head; its bite causes the mouth %0a%3c to swell. The other one is of an ashy colour, whitish on tho %0a%3c posterior part of the body, and not so ready to bite. %0a%3c %0a%3c The least noxious of all is the spider that is seen extending %0a%3c its web along the walls, and lying in wait for flies; it is of the %0a%3c same ashy colour as the last. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the bite of all spiders, the best remedies are : a cock’s %0a%3c brains, taken in oxycrate with a little pepper; five ants, swal¬ %0a%3c lowed in drink ; sheep’s dung, applied in vinegar ; and spiders %0a%3c of any kind, left to putrefy in oil. The bite of the shrew- %0a%3c mouse is cured by taking lamb’s rennet in wine ; the ashes of a %0a%3c ram’s foot with honey ; or a young weasel, prepared in manner %0a%3c already 54 mentioned by us when speaking of serpents. In %0a%3c cases where a shrewmouse has bitten beasts of burden, a mouse, %0a%3c fresh caught, is applied to the wound with oil, or a bat’s gall %0a%3c with vinegar. The shrew-mouse itself too, split asunder and %0a%3c applied to the wound, is a cure for its bite; indeed, if the %0a%3c animal is with young when the injury is inflicted, it will %0a%3c instantly burst asunder. The best plan is to apply the mouse %0a%3c itself which has inflicted the bite, but others are commonly %0a%3c kept for this purpose, either steeped in oil or coated with clay. %0a%3c Another remedy, again, for its bite is the earth taken from the %0a%3c rut made by a cart-wheel; for this animal, it is said, owing %0a%3c to a certain torpor which is natural to it, will never cross 54 %0a%3c a rut made by a wheel. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28 . -BEMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE STELLIO OR SPOTTED %0a%3c %0a%3c LIZARD. %0a%3c %0a%3c The stellio, in its turn, is said to have the greatest antipathy %0a%3c to the scorpion ; 46 so much so indeed, that the very sight of it %0a%3c strikes terror in that reptile, and a torpor attended with cold %0a%3c sweats; hence it is that this lizard is left to putrefy in oil, as %0a%3c %0a%3c 52 From fivpfir)!-, “an ant.” 53 The “four-jawed” spider. %0a%3c %0a%3c 54 In c. 16 of this Book. 55 See B. viii. e. 83. %0a%3c %0a%3c 56 See B. six. c. 22.

Any kind of pebble, applied to the wound %0a%3c on the side which has lain next to the ground, will alleviate the %0a%3c pain. A potsherd too, covered with earth on any part of it, and %0a%3c applied just as it is found, will effect a cure, it is said—the %0a%3c person, however, who applies it must not look behind him, %0a%3c and must be equally careful that the sun does not shine upon %0a%3c him. Earth-worms also, are pounded and applied to the %0a%3c wound; in addition to which, they form ingredients in numerous %0a%3c other medicaments, being kept in honey for the purpose. %0a%3c %0a%3c For injuries inflicted by bees, wasps, hornets, and leeches, %0a%3c the owlet is considered a very useful remedy ; persons, too, who %0a%3c carry about them the beak of the woodpecker 88 of Mars are %0a%3c never injured by any of these creatures. The smaller kinds %0a%3c of locusts also, destitute of wings and known as “ attelebi,” %0a%3c are a good remedy for the sting of the scorpion. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a kind of venomous ant, by no means common in %0a%3c Italy; Cicero calls it “solipuga,” and in Baetica it is known %0a%3c as “ salpuga .” 49 The proper remedy for its venom and that %0a%3c of all kinds of ants is a bat’s heart.

There is no doubt, %0a%3c however, that applied externally they are useful, in combina¬ %0a%3c tion with juice of Taminian 62 grapes, and the suet of a sheep %0a%3c or she-goat. As to the part of the body in which the poison %0a%3c of the insect is situate, authors are by no means agreed. Some %0a%3c fancy that it exists in the feet and head, while others, again, %0a%3c deny it; indeed the only point that has been well ascertained is, %0a%3c that the wings 63 are the only antidote to their venom, wherever %0a%3c it may be situate. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cantharides are produced from a small grub, found more %0a%3c particularly in the spongy excrescences which grow on the %0a%3c stem of the dog-rose , 64 and still more abundantly upon the %0a%3c ash. Other kinds, again, are found upon the white rose, but %0a%3c they are by no means so efficacious. The most active of all %0a%3c in their properties, are those which are spotted with yellow %0a%3c streaks running transversely across the wings, and are plump %0a%3c and well-filled. Those which are small, broad, and hairy, %0a%3c are not so powerful in their operation, and the least useful of all %0a%3c are those which are thin and shrivelled, and present one uniform %0a%3c colour. They are put in a small earthen pot, not coated with %0a%3c pitch, and stopped at the mouth with a linen cloth, a layer of %0a%3c full-blown roses being placed upon them ; they are then sus¬ %0a%3c pended over vinegar boiled with salt, until the steam has pene¬ %0a%3c trated the cloth and stifled them, after which they are put by %0a%3c for use. They have a caustic effect upon the skin, and cover %0a%3c the ulcerations with a crust; a property which belongs also %0a%3c to the pine-caterpillar 65 found upon the pitch-tree, and to the %0a%3c buprestis , 66 both of which are prepared in a similar manner. %0a%3c %0a%3c All these insects are extremely efficacious for the cure of %0a%3c %0a%3c 61 See B. xxvi. c. 2. 62 See B. xxiii. c. 14. %0a%3c %0a%3c 63 It has been ascertained by experiment that the vesicatory principle %0a%3c resides in the wings more particularly.

All ashes of this description, we may %0a%3c here remark once for all, are prepared in the same method; %0a%3c the substance being placed in a new earthen vessel well covered %0a%3c with potter’s clay, and put into a furnace. These ashes, too, %0a%3c are very good, taken in drink, and hence some recommend the %0a%3c head itself to be eaten in such cases. Others, again, attach to the %0a%3c body of the patient a maggot, taken from the carcase of a dead %0a%3c dog; or else place the menstruous blood of a bitch, in a linen %0a%3c cloth, beneath his cup, or insert in the wound ashes of hairs %0a%3c from the tail of the dog that inflicted the bite. Dogs will fly %0a%3c from any one who has a dog’s heart about him, and they will %0a%3c never bark at a person who carries a dog’s tongue in his shoe, %0a%3c beneath the great toe, or the tail of a weasel which has been %0a%3c set at liberty after being deprived of it. There is beneath the %0a%3c tongue of a mad dog a certain slimy spittle, which, taken in %0a%3c drink, is a preventive of hydrophobia: but much the most %0a%3c useful plan is, to take the liver of the dog that has inflicted %0a%3c the injury, and eat it raw, if possible; should that not be the %0a%3c case, it must be cooked in some way or other, or else a broth %0a%3c must be taken, prepared from the flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c 41 At the sale, under liis supervision, of the property of Ptolemy, king %0a%3c of Cyprus. 68 In ®. c - 34 - %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 406 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c pliny’s natural history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a small worm 69 in a dog’s tongue, known as “ lytta’’ ,# %0a%3c to the Greeks: if this is removed from the animal while a %0a%3c pup, it will never become mad or lose its appetite. This worm, %0a%3c after being carried thrice round a tire, is given to persons who %0a%3c have been bitten by a mad dog, to prevent them from becom¬ %0a%3c ing mad. This madness, too, is prevented by eating a cock’s %0a%3c brains ; but the virtue of these brains lasts for one year only, %0a%3c and no more. They say, too, that a cock’s comb, pounded, is %0a%3c highly efficacious as an application to the wound; as also, %0a%3c goose-grease, mixed with honey. The flesh also of a mad %0a%3c dog is sometimes salted, and taken with the food, as a remedy %0a%3c for this disease. In addition to this, young puppies of the %0a%3c same sex as the dog that has inflicted the injury, are drowned %0a%3c in water, and the person who has been bitten eats their liver %0a%3c raw.The dung of poultry, provided it is of a red colour, is %0a%3c ver} r useful, applied with vinegar; the ashes, too, of the tail %0a%3c of a shrew-mouse, if the animal has survived and been set at %0a%3c liberty; a clod from a swallow’s nest, applied with vinegar; %0a%3c the young of a swallow, reduced to ashes; or the skin or old %0a%3c slough of a serpent that has been cast in spring, beaten up %0a%3c with a male crab in wine : this slough, I would remark, put %0a%3c away by itself in chests and drawers, destroys moths. %0a%3c %0a%3c So virulent is the poison of the mad dog, that its very urine %0a%3c even, if trod upon, is injurious, more particularly if the person %0a%3c has any ulcerous sores about him. The proper remedy in such %0a%3c case is to apply horse-dung, sprinkled with vinegar, and warmed %0a%3c in a fig. These marvellous properties of the poison will occa¬ %0a%3c sion the less surprise, when we remember that, “ a stone bitten %0a%3c by a dog ” has become a proverbial expression for discord and %0a%3c variance. 71 Whoever makes water where a dog has previ¬ %0a%3c ously watered, will be sensible of numbness in the loins, they %0a%3c say. %0a%3c %0a%3c 69 This is still the vulgar notion ; but in reality there is no worm, but %0a%3c certain white pustules beneath the tongue, which break spontaneously at %0a%3c the end of twelve days after birth. Puppies are still “ wormed,” as it is %0a%3c called, as a preventive of hydrophobia, it is said, and of a propensity to %0a%3c gnaw objects which come in their way. The “ worming ” consists in the %0a%3c breaking of these pustules. 70 “ Rage ” or “ madness.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 71 “ For the manner of a dog is to bee angrie with the stone that is %0a%3c thrown at him, without regard to the partie that flung it, whereupon grew %0a%3c the proverb in Greeke, kvo>v tov \i0ov liyavaKrouaci (‘ A dog ventiug %0a%3c his rage upon a stone.’)”— Holland. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 33.] REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER POISONS. 407 %0a%3c %0a%3c The lizard known by some persons as the “ seps,” 72 and by %0a%3c others as the “ chalcidice,” taken in wine, is a cure for its %0a%3c own bite. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 33.- REMEDIES FOR THE OTHER TOISONS. %0a%3c %0a%3c Where persons have been poisoned by noxious preparations %0a%3c from the wild weasel, 73 the proper remedy is the broth of an %0a%3c old cock, taken in considerable quantities. This broth, too, %0a%3c is particularly good, taken as a counter-poison for aconite, in %0a%3c combination with a little salt. Poultry dung—but the white %0a%3c part only—boiled with hyssop, or with honied wine, is an ex¬ %0a%3c cellent antidote to the poison of fungi and of mushrooms : it is %0a%3c a cure also for flatulency and suffocations ; a thing the more to %0a%3c be wondered at, seeing that if any other living creature only %0a%3c tastes this dung, it is immediately attacked with griping pains %0a%3c and flatulency. Goose blood, taken with an equal quantity of %0a%3c olive oil, is an excellent neutralizer of the venom of the sea- %0a%3c hare : it is kept also as an antidote for all kinds of noxious %0a%3c drugs,made up into lozenges with red earth of Lemnos and juice %0a%3c of white-thorn, five drachmae of the lozenges being taken in %0a%3c three cyathi of water. The same property belongs also to the %0a%3c young of the weasel, prepared in manner already 74 mentioned. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lambs’ rennet is an excellent antidote to all noxious pre¬ %0a%3c parations ; the blood, also, of ducks from Pontus ; 75 for which %0a%3c reason it is preserved in a dry state, and dissolved in wine when %0a%3c wanted, some persons being of opinion that the blood of the %0a%3c female bird is the most efficacious. In a similar manner, the %0a%3c crop of a stork acts as an universal counter-poison ; and so does %0a%3c sheep’s rennet. A broth made from ram’s flesh is particu¬ %0a%3c larly good as a remedy for cantharides: sheep’s milk also, taken %0a%3c warm; this last being very useful in cases where persons %0a%3c have drunk an infusion of aconite, or have swallowed the %0a%3c buprestis in drink.

(6.)-REMEDIES FOR ALOPECY. %0a%3c %0a%3c Where the hair has been lost through alopecy, 76 it is made %0a%3c to grow again by using ashes of burnt sheep’s dung, with oil of %0a%3c Cyprus 77 and honey ; or else the hoof of a mule of either sex, %0a%3c burnt to ashes and mixed with oil of myrtle. In addition to these %0a%3c substances, we find our own writer, Yarro, mentioning mouse- %0a%3c dung, which he calls “ muscerda,” 78 and the heads of flies, %0a%3c applied fresh, the part being first rubbed with a fig-leaf. %0a%3c Some recommend the blood of flies, while others, again, apply %0a%3c ashes of burnt flies for ten days, in the proportion of one part %0a%3c of the ashes to two of ashes of papyrus or of nuts. In other %0a%3c cases, again, we find ashes of burnt flies kneaded up with %0a%3c woman’s milk and cabbage, or, in some instances, with honey %0a%3c only. It is generally believed that there is no creature less %0a%3c docile or less intelligent than the fly; a circumstance which %0a%3c makes it all the more marvellous that at the sacred games at %0a%3c Olympia, immediately after the immolation of the bull in %0a%3c honour of the god called ** Myiodes,” 79 whole clouds of them %0a%3c take their departure from that territory. A mouse’s head or %0a%3c tail, or, indeed, the whole of the body, reduced to ashes, is a %0a%3c cure for alopecy, more particularly when the loss of the hair has %0a%3c been the result of some noxious preparation. The ashes of a %0a%3c hedge-hog, mixed with honey, or of its skin, applied with tar, %0a%3c are productive of a similar effect. The head, too, of this last %0a%3c animal, reduced to ashes, restores the hair to scars upon the %0a%3c body ; the place being first prepared, when this cure is made %0a%3c use of, with a razor and an application of mustard: some %0a%3c persons, however, prefer vinegar for the purpose. All the %0a%3c properties attributed to the hedge-hog are found in the por¬ %0a%3c cupine in a still higher degree. 80 %0a%3c %0a%3c A lizard burnt, as already 81 mentioned, with the fresh root %0a%3c of a reed, cut as fine as possible, to facilitate its being re- %0a%3c %0a%3c 76 So called from a\ivn “ a fox,” an animal very subject to the loss %0a%3c of its hair. 17 See B. xii. c. 51. %0a%3c %0a%3c 78 So swine’s dung was called “ sucerda,” and cowdung “ bucerda." %0a%3c %0a%3c 79 Or Maagrus, the “fly catcher,” the name of a hero, invoked at Ali- %0a%3c phera, at the festivals of Athena, as the protector against flies.

For all these purposes %0a%3c green lizards are still more efficacious, and the remedy is ren¬ %0a%3c dered most effectual, when salt is added, bears’ grease, and %0a%3c pounded onions. Some persons boil ten green lizards in ten %0a%3c 6extarii of oil, and content themselves with rubbing the place %0a%3c with the mixture once a month. Alopecy is also cured very %0a%3c speedily with the ashes of a viper’s skin, or by an application %0a%3c of fresh poultry dung. A raven’s egg, beaten up in a copper %0a%3c vessel and applied to the head, previously shaved, imparts a %0a%3c black colour to the hair ; care must be taken, however, to keep %0a%3c some oil in the mouth till the application is quite dry, or else %0a%3c the teeth will turn black as well. The operation must be per¬ %0a%3c formed also in the shade, and the liniment must not be washed %0a%3c off before the end of three days. Some persons employ the %0a%3c blood and brains of a raven, in combination with red wine; %0a%3c while others, again, boil down the bird, and put it, at bedtime, %0a%3c in a vessel made of lead. With some it is the practice, for %0a%3c the cure of alopecy, to apply bruised cantharides with tar, the %0a%3c skin being first prepared with an application of nitre :—it %0a%3c should be remembered, however, that cantharides are possessed %0a%3c of caustic properties, and due care must be taken not to let %0a%3c them eat too deep into the skin. For the ulcerations thus pro¬ %0a%3c duced, it is recommended to use applications made of the heads, %0a%3c gall, and dung of mice, mixed with hellebore and pepper. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35. -EEMEDIES FOE LICE AND FOE PORKIGO. %0a%3c %0a%3c Nits are destroyed by using dogs’ fat, eating serpents cooked 62 %0a%3c like eels, or else taking their sloughs in drink.

The fresh gall, too, of the asio 89 is used, a bird belonging %0a%3c to the owlet tribe, with feathers standing erect like ears. %0a%3c Apollonius of Pitanae used to prefer dog’s gall, in combina¬ %0a%3c tion with honey, to that of the hyaena, for the cure of cataract, %0a%3c as also of albugo. The heads and tails of mice, reduced to %0a%3c ashes and applied to the eyes, improve the sight, it is said ; a %0a%3c result which is ensured with even greater certainty by using the %0a%3c ashes of a dormouse or wild mouse, or else the brains or gall %0a%3c of an eagle. The ashes and fat of a field-mouse, beaten up %0a%3c with Attic honey and antimony, are remarkably useful for %0a%3c watery eyes—what this antimony 90 is, we shall have occasion %0a%3c to say when speaking of metals. %0a%3c %0a%3c For the cure of cataract, the ashes of a weasel are used, as %0a%3c also the brains of a lizard or swallow. Weasels, boiled and %0a%3c pounded, and so applied to the forehead, allay defluxions of the %0a%3c eyes, either used alone, or else with fine flour or with frankin¬ %0a%3c cense. Employed in a similar manner, they are very good for %0a%3c sun-stroke, or in other words, for injuries inflicted by the sun. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a remarkably good plan, too, to burn these animals alive, %0a%3c and to use their ashes, with Cretan honey, as a liniment for %0a%3c %0a%3c >6 See c. 13 of this Book. 87 See B. xxvi. c. 39. %0a%3c %0a%3c A disease of the crystalline humours of the eye. %0a%3c %0a%3c w See B. x. c. 33. 90 “ Stibium.” See B. xxxiii. c. 33. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 412 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLINY’S NATURAL HISTORY. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Hook XXIX. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c films upon the eyes. The cast-off 91 slough of the asp, with %0a%3c the fat of that reptile, forms an excellent ointment for im¬ %0a%3c proving the sight in beasts of burden. To burn a viper alive %0a%3c in a new earthen vessel, with one cyathus of fennel juice, %0a%3c and a single grain of frankincense, and then to anoint the eyes %0a%3c with the mixture, is remarkably good for cataract and films %0a%3c upon the eyes; the preparation being generally known as %0a%3c “echeon.” 91 * An eye-salve, too, is prepared, by leaving a %0a%3c viper to putrefy in an earthen pot, and bruising the maggots %0a%3c that breed in it with saffron. A viper, too, is burnt in a %0a%3c vessel with salt, and the preparation is applied to the tip of %0a%3c the tongue, to improve the eyesight, and to act generally as a %0a%3c corrective of the stomach and other parts of the body. This %0a%3c salt is given also to sheep, to preserve them in health, and is %0a%3c used as an ingredient in antidotes to the venom of serpents. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some persons, again, use vipers as an article of food: when %0a%3c this is done, it is recommended, the moment they are killed, %0a%3c to put some salt in the mouth and let it melt there; after %0a%3c which, the body must be cut away to the length of four fingers %0a%3c at each extremity, and, the intestines being first removed, the %0a%3c remainder boiled in a mixture of water, oil, salt, and dill. %0a%3c When thus prepared, they are either eaten at once, or else %0a%3c kneaded in a loaf, and taken from time to time as wanted. %0a%3c In addition to the above-mentioned properties, viper-broth %0a%3c cleanses all parts of the body of lice, 92 and removes itching %0a%3c sensations as well upon the surface of the skin. The ashes, %0a%3c also, of a viper’s head, used by themselves, are evidently pro¬ %0a%3c ductive of considerable effects; they are employed very advan¬ %0a%3c tageously in the form of a liniment for the eyes; and so, too, is %0a%3c viper’s fat. I would not make so bold ae to advise what is %0a%3c strongly recommended by some, the use, namely, of vipers’ %0a%3c gall; for that, as already stated 93 on a more appropriate occa¬ %0a%3c sion, is nothing else but the venom of the serpent. The fat of %0a%3c snakes, mixed with verdigrease, 94 heals ruptures of the cuticle %0a%3c of the eyes; and the skin or slough that is cast off in spring, %0a%3c employed as a friction for the eyes, improves the sight.

A vulture’s gall, too, mixed %0a%3c with leek-juice and a little honey, is possessed of similar pro¬ %0a%3c perties ; and the gall of a cock, dissolved in water, is employed %0a%3c for the cure of argema and albugo : the gall, too, of a white %0a%3c cock, in particular, is recommended for cataract^For short¬ %0a%3c sighted persons, the dung of poultry is recommended as a lini¬ %0a%3c ment, care being taken to use that of a reddish colour only. %0a%3c A hen’s gall, too, is highly spoken of, and the fat in particular, %0a%3c for the cure of pustules upon the pupils, a purpose for which %0a%3c hens are expressly fattened. This last substance is marvel¬ %0a%3c lously useful for ruptures of the coats of the eyes, incorporated %0a%3c with the stones known as schistos 91 and haematites. Hens’ %0a%3c dung, too, but only the white part of it, is kept with old oil %0a%3c in boxes made of horn, for the cure of white specks upon the %0a%3c pupil of the eye. While mentioning this subject, it is worthy %0a%3c of remark, that peacocks 98 swallow their dung, it is said, as %0a%3c though they envied man the various uses of it. A hawk, %0a%3c boiled in oil of roses, is considered extremely efficacious as a lini¬ %0a%3c ment for all affections of the eyes, and so are the ashes of its %0a%3c dung, mixed with Attic honey. A kite’s liver, too, is highly %0a%3c esteemed; and pigeons’ dung, diluted with vinegar, is used as %0a%3c an application for fistulas of the eye, as also for albugo and %0a%3c marks upon that organ. Goose gall and duck’s blood are very %0a%3c useful for contusions of the eyes, care being taken, immediately %0a%3c after the application, to anoint them with a mixture of wool- %0a%3c grease and honey. In similar cases, too, gall of partridges is %0a%3c used, with an equal quantity of honey; but where it is only %0a%3c wanted to improve the sight, the gall is used alone. It is %0a%3c generally thought, too, upou the authority of Hippocrates, 99 %0a%3c %0a%3c 15 See B. viii. c. 14.

For the %0a%3c treatment of blood-shot eyes, the blood of pigeons, ring-doves, %0a%3c turtle-doves, and partridges is remarkably useful; but that %0a%3c of the male pigeon is generally looked upon as the most effica¬ %0a%3c cious. For this purpose, a vein is opened beneath the wing, %0a%3c it being warmer than the rest of the blood, and consequently %0a%3c more 1 beneficial. After it is applied, a compress, boiled in %0a%3c honey, should be laid upon it, and some greasy wool, boiled in %0a%3c oil and wine. Xyctalopy, 2 too, is cured by using the blood of %0a%3c these birds, or the liver of a sheep —the most efficacious %0a%3c being that of a tawny sheep — as already 3 stated by us %0a%3c when speaking of goats. A decoction, too, of the liver is %0a%3c recommended as a wash for the eyes, and, for pains and swell¬ %0a%3c ings in those organs, the marrow, used as a liniment. The eyes %0a%3c of a horned owl, it is strongly asserted, reduced to ashes and %0a%3c mixed in an eye-salve, will improve the sight. Albugo is made %0a%3c to disappear by using the dung of turtle-doves, snails burnt to %0a%3c ashes, and the dung of the cenchris, a kind of hawk, according %0a%3c to the Greeks. 4 All the substances above mentioned, used in %0a%3c combination with honey, are curative of argema : honey, too, %0a%3c in which the bees have died, is remarkably good for the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c A person who has eaten the young of the stork will never %0a%3c suffer from ophthalmia for many years to come, it is said; and %0a%3c the same when a person carries about him the head of a %0a%3c dragon : 5 it is stated, too, that the fat of this last-named %0a%3c animal, applied with honey and old oil, will disperse incipient %0a%3c films of the eyes. The young of the swallow are blinded at %0a%3c lull moon, and the moment their sight is restored, 6 their heads %0a%3c are burnt, and the ashes are employed, with honey, to improve %0a%3c the sight, and for the cure of pains, ophthalmia, and contu¬ %0a%3c sions of the eyes. %0a%3c %0a%3c Lizards, also, are employed in numerous ways as a remedy %0a%3c %0a%3c 1 A puerile reason, Ajasson remarks.

Some persons enclose a green lizard %0a%3c m a new earthen vessel, together with nine of the small stones %0a%3c known as “ cintedia,” 7 which are usually attached to the body %0a%3c for tumours in the groin. Upon each of these stones they %0a%3c make nine 8 marks, and remove one from the vessel daily, %0a%3c taking care, when the ninth day is come, to let the lizard go’ %0a%3c the stones being kept as a remedy for affections of the eyes! %0a%3c Others, again, blind a green lizard, and after putting some %0a%3c earth beneath it, enclose it in a glass vessel, with some small %0a%3c rings of solid iron or gold. When they find, by looking %0a%3c through the glass, that the lizard has recovered its sight, 9 they %0a%3c set it at liberty, and keep the rings as a preservative against %0a%3c ophthalmia. Others employ the ashes of a lizard’s head as %0a%3c a substitute for antimony, for the treatment of eruptions of the %0a%3c eyes. Some recommend the ashes of the green lizard wdth a long %0a%3c neck that is usually found in sandy soils, as an application for %0a%3c incipient defluxions of the eyes, and for glaucoma. They say, %0a%3c too, that if the eyes of a -weasel are extracted with a pointed %0a%3c instrument, its sight will return; the same use being made of it %0a%3c as of the lizards and rings above mentioned. The right eye %0a%3c of a serpent, worn as an amulet, is very good, it is said, for %0a%3c defluxions of the eyes, due care being taken to set the serpent %0a%3c at liberty after extracting the eye. For continuous watering 10 %0a%3c of the eyes, the ashes of a spotted lizard’s head, applied with %0a%3c antimony, are remarkably efficacious. %0a%3c %0a%3c The cobweb of the common fly-spider, that which lines its %0a%3c hole more particularly, applied to the forehead across the %0a%3c temples, in a compress of some kind or other, is said to be %0a%3c marvellously useful for the cure of defluxions of the eyes : the %0a%3c web must be taken, however, and applied by the hands of a %0a%3c boy who has not arrived at the years of puberty; the bov, %0a%3c too, must not show himself to the patient for three days, and %0a%3c during those three days neither of them must touch the %0a%3c ground with his feet uncovered.

Pains in those organs are allayed by injecting a bitch’s %0a%3c milk ; and hardness of hearing is removed by using dogs’ fat, %0a%3c with wormwood and old oil, or else goose-grease. Some per¬ %0a%3c sons add juice of onions and of garlic, 12 * in equal proportions. %0a%3c The eggs, too, of ants are used, by themselves, for this purpose; %0a%3c these insects being possessed, in fact, of certain medicinal pro¬ %0a%3c perties, and bears, it is well known, curing themselves when %0a%3c sick, by eating 13 them as food. Goose-grease, and indeed that %0a%3c of all birds, is prepared by removing all the veins and leaving %0a%3c the fat, in a new, shallow, earthen vessel, well covered, to melt %0a%3c in the sun, some boiling water being placed beneath it; which %0a%3c done, it is passed through linen strainers, and is then put by %0a%3c in a cool spot, in a new earthen vessel, for keeping: with the %0a%3c addition of honey it is less liable to turn rancid. Ashes of %0a%3c burnt mice, injected with honey or boiled with oil of roses, %0a%3c allay pains in the ears. In cases where an insect has got into %0a%3c the ears, a most excellent remedy is found in an injection of %0a%3c mouse gall, diluted with vinegar; where, too, water has made %0a%3c its way into the passages of the ear, goose-grease is used, in com¬ %0a%3c bination with juice of onions. Some persons skin a dormouse, %0a%3c and after removing the intestines boil the body in a new vessel %0a%3c with honey. Medical men, however, prefer boiling it down %0a%3c to one-third with nard, and recommend it to be kept in that %0a%3c state, and to be warmed when wanted, and injected with a %0a%3c syringe.

The red worms, also, that are found upon trees, %0a%3c beaten up with oil, are a most excellent remedy for ulcerations %0a%3c and ruptures of the ears. Lizards, which have been suspended %0a%3c for some time and dried, with salt in the mouth, are curative %0a%3c of contusions of the ears, and of injuries inflicted by blows : %0a%3c the most efficacious for this purpose are those which have iron- %0a%3c coloured spots upon the skin, 14 and are streaked with lines %0a%3c along the tail. %0a%3c %0a%3c Millepedes, known also as “centipedes” or “multipedes,” %0a%3c are insects belonging to the earth-worm genus, hairy, with %0a%3c numerous feet, forming curves as they crawl, and contracting %0a%3c themselves when touched : the Greeks give to this insect the %0a%3c name of “ouiscos,” 13 others, again, that of “tylos.” Boiled %0a%3c with leek-juice in a pomegranate rind, it is highly efficacious, %0a%3c they say, for pains in the ears; oil of roses being added to %0a%3c the preparation, and the mixture injected into the ear opposite %0a%3c to the one affected. As for that kind which does not describe a %0a%3c curve when moving, the Greeks give it the name of “seps,” %0a%3c while others, again, call it “ scolopendrait is smaller than the %0a%3c former one, and is injurious. 16 The snails which are commonly %0a%3c used as food, are applied to the ears with myrrh or powdered %0a%3c frankincense; and those with a small, broad, shell are employed %0a%3c with honey as a liniment for fractured ears. Old sloughs of %0a%3c serpents, burnt in a heated potsherd and mixed with oil ot %0a%3c roses, are used as an injection for the ears, which is considered %0a%3c highly efficacious for all affections of those organs, and for %0a%3c offensive odours arising therefrom in particular. In cases %0a%3c where there is suppuration of the ears, vinegar is used, and it %0a%3c is still better if goat’s gall, ox-gall, or that of the sea tortoise, is %0a%3c added.

Nigidius attributes great 17 %0a%3c virtues to this insect, and the magicians still greater, and all %0a%3c because it walks backwards, pierces the earth, and chirrups hy %0a%3c night! The mode of catching it is by throwing an ant, 18 made %0a%3c fast with a hair, into its hole, the dust being first blown away %0a%3c to prevent it from concealing itself: the moment it seizes the %0a%3c ant, it is drawn out. %0a%3c %0a%3c The dried craw of poultry, a part that is generally thrown %0a%3c away, is beaten up in wine, and injected warm, for suppura¬ %0a%3c tions of the ears; the same, too, with the grease of poultry. %0a%3c %0a%3c On pulling off the head of a black beetle, 19 it yields a sort %0a%3c of greasy substance, which, beaten up with rose oil, is marvel¬ %0a%3c lously good, they say, for affections of the ears: care must be %0a%3c taken, however, to remove the wool very soon, or else this sub¬ %0a%3c stance will be speedily transformed into an animal, in the %0a%3c shape of a small grub. Some writers assert that two or three %0a%3c of these insects, boiled in oil, are extremely efficacious for the %0a%3c ears ; and that they are good, beaten up and applied in linen, %0a%3c for contusions of those organs. %0a%3c %0a%3c This insect, also, is one of those that are of a disgusting %0a%3c character; but I am obliged, by the admiration which I feel for %0a%3c the operations of Nature, and for the careful researches, of the %0a%3c ancients, to enter somewhat more at large upon it on the pre¬ %0a%3c sent occasion. Their writers have described several varieties %0a%3c of it; the soft beetle, for instance, which, boiled in oil, has %0a%3c been found by experience to be a very useful liniment for %0a%3c warts. Another kind, to which they have given the name of %0a%3c “ mylcecon,” 20 is generally found in the vicinity of mills: de¬ %0a%3c prived of the head, it has been found to be curative of leprosy %0a%3c —at least Musa 21 and Picton 22 have cited instances to that effect. %0a%3c %0a%3c 17 _ In the middle ages there were many superstitions with reference to %0a%3c this insect, some of which have survived to the present day. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Ajasson seems to think that this passage means that the ant itself %0a%3c adopts this plan of catching the cricket. If so, he is certainly in error, %0a%3c and his attack upon Pliny’s credulity is, in this instance at least, misplaced. %0a%3c %0a%3c 19 See B. xi. c. 34. and B. xxv. c. 60. %0a%3c %0a%3c 20 “ Inhabiting mills.” %0a%3c %0a%3c 21 See B. xix. c. 38, and B. xxv. c. 38. %0a%3c %0a%3c 22 Of this writer nothing is known. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap 39.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c SUMMART. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 419 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a third kind, again, odious for its abominable smell, %0a%3c and tapering at the posterior extremities. Used in combina¬ %0a%3c tion with pisselaeon, 23 it is curative, they say, of ulcers of u %0a%3c desperate nature, and, if kept applied for one-and-twenty days, %0a%3c for scrofulous sores and inflamed tumours. The legs and wings %0a%3c being first removed, it is employed for the cure of bruises, contu¬ %0a%3c sions, cancerous sores, itch-scabs, and boils—remedies, all of %0a%3c them, quite disgusting even to hear of. And yet, by Hercules ! %0a%3c Diodorus 24 tells us that he has administered this remedy inter¬ %0a%3c nally, with resin and honey, for jaundice and hardness of %0a%3c breathing; such unlimited power has the medical art to pre¬ %0a%3c scribe as a remedy whatever it thinks fit! %0a%3c %0a%3c Physicians who keep more within bounds, recommend the %0a%3c ashes of these insects to be kept for these various purposes in a %0a%3c box made of horn; or else that they should be bruised and injected %0a%3c in a lavement for hardness of breathing and catarrhs. At all %0a%3c events, that, applied externally, they extract foreign substances %0a%3c adhering to the flesh, is a fact well known. %0a%3c %0a%3c Honey, too, in which the bees have died, is remarkably use¬ %0a%3c ful for affections of the ears. Pigeons’ dung, applied by itself, %0a%3c or with barley-meal or oat-meal, reduces imposthumes of the %0a%3c parotid glands ; a result which is equally obtained by injecting %0a%3c into the ear an owlet’s brains or liver, mixed with oil, or by %0a%3c applying the mixture to the parotid glands; also, by applying %0a%3c millepedes with one-third part of resin ; by using crickets in the %0a%3c form of a liniment; or by wearing crickets attached to the body %0a%3c as an amulet. The other kinds of maladies, and the several %0a%3c remedies for them, derived from the same animals or from others %0a%3c of the same class, we shall describe in the succeeding Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Summary. — Remedies, narratives, and observations, six %0a%3c hundred and twenty-one. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Roman authors quoted. — M.

He speaks of an ancient %0a%3c poet of Athens of this name, who wrote a Cosmogony and other works; %0a%3c a native of Priene, to whom some attributed the work on “ Incredible %0a%3c Stories,” by most persons assigned to Palsephatus of Athens; an historian %0a%3c of Abydos, a contemporary of Alexander the Great, and a friend of A ristotle; %0a%3c and a grammarian of Athens of uncertain date, to whom the work on %0a%3c “ Incredible Stories ” is mostly assigned. But in the former editions of %0a%3c Pliny, the reading “ Philopator ” is mostly adopted ; bearing reference, it %0a%3c has been suggested, to a Stoic philosopher and physician of that name men¬ %0a%3c tioned by Galen, “ On the Symptoms of Mental Diseases,” c. 8. %0a%3c %0a%3c 42 See end of B. ii. 43 See end of B. xxi. 41 See end of B. xiii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 45 See end of B. xi. 46 See end of B. xii. %0a%3c %0a%3c 47 There were two Greek physicians of this name, one of whom was a %0a%3c native of Thasos, and wrote several medical works. The other was a native %0a%3c of Cnidos, and, according to Suidas, a slave of the philosopher Chry- %0a%3c sippus. Galen, however, says that he was a pupil of the physician of that %0a%3c name, and afterwards became physician to Antigonus Gonatas, king of %0a%3c Macedonia, b c. 283—239. Hardouin is of opinion that the two phy¬ %0a%3c sicians were one and the same person. %0a%3c %0a%3c 4 ’ See end of B. xx. %0a%3c %0a%3c 49 Servilius Democrates, a Greek physician at Piome about the time of %0a%3c the Christian era. He probably received his praenomen from being a %0a%3c client of the Servilian family. Pliny speaks of him in B. xxiv. c. %0a%3c 28, and B. xxv. c. 49. He wrote several works on medicine in Greek %0a%3c Iambic verse, the titles and a few extracts from which are preserved by %0a%3c Galen. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Probably the same physician that is mentioned by Galen as belonging %0a%3c to the sect of the Empirici.
