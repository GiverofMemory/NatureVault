The next thing, then, would be to speak of the glandi- %0aferous trees, the trees which proffered the earliest nutriment %0ato the appetite of man, and proved themselves his foster- %0amothers in his forlorn and savage statC' — did I not feel myself %0aconstrained on this occasion to make some mention of the sur- %0aprise which I have felt on finding by actual experience what %0ais the life of mortals when they inhabit a country that is with- %0aout either tree or shrub. %0a%0a(1.) I have already stated- that in the East many nations %0athat dwell on the shores of the ocean arc placed in this neces- %0asitous state ; and I myself have personally witnessed the con- %0adition of the Chauci,^ both the Greater and the Lesser, situate %0aiu the regions of the far North. In those climates a vast tract %0aof land, invaded twice each day and night by the overflowing %0awaves of the ocean, opens a question that is eternally proposed %0ato us by Nature, whether these regions are to be looked upon %0aas belonging to the land, or whether as forming a portion of %0athe sea ? %0a%0aHere a wretched race is found, inhabiting either the more %0aelevated spots of land, or else eminences artificially constructed, %0aand of a height to which they know by experience that the %0aliighest tides will never reach. Here they pitch their cabins ; %0a%0aJ The methods of grafting and inoculation. %0a%0a2 B. xiii. c. 50.

It is %0anot their lot, like the adjoining nations, to keep any flocks for %0asustenance by their milk, nor even to maintain a warfare with %0awild beasts, everj- shrub, even, being banished afar. With the %0asedge* and the rushes of the marsh they make cords, and %0awith these they weave the nets employed in the capture of the %0afish ; they fashion the mud,^ too, with their hands, and drj-ing %0ait by the help of the winds more than of the sun, cook their %0afood by its aid, and so warm their entrails, frozen as they %0aare by the northern blasts ; their only" drink, too, is rain- %0awater, which they collect in holes dug at the entrance of their %0aabodes : and yet these nations, if this very day they were van- %0aquished by the Koman people, would exclaim against being %0areduced'' to slavery ! Be it so, then — Fortune is most kind to %0amany, just when she means to punish them.^ %0a%0aCHAP. 2. WONDERS CONNECTED WITH TKEES IN THE NOETHEEN %0a%0aEEGIONS. %0a%0aAnother marvel, too, connected with the forests ! They %0acover all the rest of Germany, and by their shade augment the %0acold. But the highest of them all are those not far distant %0afrom the Chauci already mentioned, and more particularly in %0athe vicinity of the two lakes'* there. The very shores are lined %0awith oaks,'" which manifest an extraordinary eagerness to %0a%0a* " UlvA." This appears to be a general name for all kinds of aquatic %0afresh- water plants; as "alga" is that of the various sea-weeds. %0a%0a* He alludes to turf for firing ; the Humus turfa of tlie naturalists. %0a%0a^ Of course this applies only to those who dwelt near the sea-shore, and %0anot those more inland. %0a%0a^ Guichardin remarks, that Pliny does not here bear in mind the sweets %0aof liberty. %0a%0a^ So Laberius says, " Fortuna multis parcere in pcenam solet;" "For- %0atune is the saving of many, when she means to punish them." %0a%0a^ He alludes to the vicinity of the Zuyder Zee. See B. iv. c. 29. The %0aspots where these forests once stood are now cultivated plains, covered with %0aTillages and other works of the industry of man. %0a%0a" Quercus." We shall see, in the course of this Book, that its identity %0ahas not been satisfactorily established. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 3.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE ACOny OAK. %0a%0a%0a%0a341 %0a%0a%0a%0aattain their growth : undermined by the waves or uprooted by %0athe blasts, with their entwining roots they carry vast forests %0aalong with them, and, thus balanced, stand upright as they float %0aalong, while they spread afar their huge branches Uke the %0angging of so many ships. Many is the time that these trees %0ahave struck our fleets with alarm, when the waves have driven %0athem, almost purposely it would seem, against their prows as %0athey stood at anchor in the night ; and the men, destitute of %0aall remedy and resource, have had to engage in a naval com- %0abat with a forest of trees ! %0a%0a(2.) In the same northern regions, too, is the Hercynian'^ %0aForest, whose gigantic oaks,^^ uninjured by the lapse of ages, %0aand contemporary with the creation of the world, by their near %0aapproach to immortality surpass all other marvels known. Not %0ato speak of other matters that would surpass all belief, it is a %0awell-known fact that their roots," as they meet together, up- %0aheave vast hills ; or, if the earth happens not to accumulate %0awith them, rise aloft to the very branches even, and, as they %0acontend for the mastery, form arcades, like so many portals %0athrown open, and large enough to admit of the passage of a %0asquadron of horse. %0a%0a(3.) All these trees, in general, belong to the glandiferous %0aclass," and have ever been held in the highest honour by the %0aKoman people. %0a%0aCHAP. 3. (4.) THE ACORN OAK. THE CIVIC CEOWN. %0a%0aIt is with the leaves of this class of trees that our civic %0acrown is made, the most glorious reward that can be bestowed %0aon military valour, and, for this long time past, the emblem of %0athe imperial'* clemency ; since the time, in fact, Avhen, after %0a%0a" See 13. iv. c. 28, and the Note, Vol. i. p. 348.

It will be seen in this Book that the robur has not been %0aidentified, any more than the quercus. %0a%0a'3 Fee treats this story as utterly fabulous. The branches of the Ficus %0aIiidica grow downwards, and so form arcades certainly ; but such is not the %0aCiise with any European tree. %0a%0aNot only oaks, but a variety of other trees, were included under this %0aname by the ancients; the "glans" embracing not only the acorn, but %0atlie mast of the beech, and the hard fruits of other trees. %0a%0a'* He alludes to the crown of oak-leaves, which was suspended on tlie %0agates before the palace of the emperors. A civic crown had been voted by %0athe senate to Julius Coesar, on the ground of having saved his country. %0a%0a%0a%0a342 %0a%0a%0a%0apli>'t's natural histokt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0athe irapiety of civil war, it was first deemed a meritorious %0aaction not to shed the blood of a fellow-citizen. Far inferior %0ato this in rank are the mural'" crown, the vallar," and the %0agolden'* one, superior though they may be in the value of the %0amaterial : inferior, too, in merit, is thi; rostrate'* crown, though %0aennobled, in recent times more particularly, by two great names, %0athose of M. Varro,^° who was presented with it by Pompeius %0aMagnus, for his great achievements in the Piratic AYar, and of %0aM. Agrippa, on whom it was bestowed by Cfesar, at the end %0aof the Sicilian War, which was also a war against pirates. %0a%0aIn former days the beaks^' of vessels, fastened in front of the %0atribunjil, graced the Forum, and seemed, as it were, a crown %0aplaced upon the head of the lloman people itself. In later %0atimes, however, they began to be polluted and trodden under %0afoot amid the seditious movements of the tribunes, the public %0ainterest was sacrificed to private advantage, each citizen %0asought solely his own advancement, and everything looked %0aupon as holy was abandoned to profanation — still, from amid %0aall this, the Rostra^^ emerged once again, and passed from %0abeneath the feet of the citizens to their heads. Augustus %0apresented to Agrippa the rostrate crown, while he himself %0areceived the civic crown"^ at the hands of all mankind. %0a%0aCHAP. 4. THE OEIGIN OF THE PEESENTATION OF CROWNS. %0a%0aIn ancient times crowns were presented to none but a %0a%0aGiven to the first man who scaled the wall of a besieged place. It %0awas made of gold, and decorated with turrets. %0a%0aGiven to the first soldier who surmounted the vallum or entrench- %0aments. It was made of gold, and ornameuted with " valli," or palisades. %0a%0aOne of the varieties of the triumphal crown was the " corona aurea," %0aor " golden crown." %0a%0a'9 Made of gold, and decorated with the rostra," or "beaks " of ships. %0a2« See B. vh. c. 31. %0a%0a21 The orator's stage in the Forum was decorated with the "rostra," or %0a" beaks " of the ships of the Antiates ; hence it received tlie name cf " Eos-' %0atrum." The locality of the Rostra was changed by Julius Csesar. %0a%0a32 Alluding to the prostitution of the Rostra by the tribunes and others %0afor the purposes of sedition, and the presentation by Augustus of the ros- %0atrate crown to Agrippa. %0a%0a23 Which was suspended, as already mentioned, at the gate of his palace. %0a%0a25 Athenaeus and Fabius Pictor say that Janus was the first wearer of a %0acrown ; Pherecydes says it was Saturn, Diodorus Siculus Jupiter, and Leo %0a^gyptiacus Isis, who wore one of wheat. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 5.] PEESONS CROWITED WLTR LEAVES. 343 %0a%0admnity hence it is that Hoiner"« awards them only to the %0agods ot heaven and to the entire army ; but never to an indi- %0avidual, however great his achievements in battle may have %0abeen. It is said, too, that Father Liber was the first of all %0awho placed a crown on his head, and that it was made of ivy." %0aIn succeeding times, those engaged in sacrifices in honour of %0athe gods began to wear them, the victims being decked with %0awreaths as well. More recently, again, they were employed %0ain the sacred games and at the present day they are be- %0astowed on such occasions, not upon the victor, indeed, but %0aupon his country, which receives, it is proclaimed, this crown at %0ahis hands.-^ Hence arose the usage of conferring wreaths upon %0awarriors when about to enjoy a triumph, for them to conse- %0acrate in the temples : after which it became the custom to %0apresent them at our games. It would be a lengthy matter, %0aand, indeed, foreign to the purpose of this work, to enter upon %0aa discussion who was the first lloman that received each kind %0aof crOwn ; in fact, they were acquainted with none but such as %0awere given as the reward of military prowess. It is a well- %0aknown fact, however, that this people has more varieties of %0acrowns than those of all other nations put together. %0a%0aCHAP. 5. PEESONS PRESENTED WITH A CROWN OF LEAVES. %0a%0aRomulus presented Hostus Hostilius^" Avith a crown of leaves, %0afor being the first to enter Tidcnse. This Hostus was the %0agrandfather of King Tullus Hostilius. P. Decius the elder, %0athe military tribune, was presented with a crown of leaves by %0athe army which had been saved by his valour, under the com- %0amand of Cornelius Cossus,'^ the consul, in the war with the %0aSamnites. This crown was made at first of the leaves of the %0aholm oak, but afterwards those of the aesculus^- were pre- %0aferred, as being a tree sacred to Jupiter : this, however, was %0asoon employed indifferently with the quercus, according as %0a%0a2« II. xiii. 736. %0a%0a" See CO. 34 and 35 of the present Book. %0a%0a28 The Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemaean games. %0a%0a29 See B. vii. c. 27. . ,. %0a%0aso He is called Tullus Hostilius by Dionysuis of Halicamassus, the same %0aas his ffrandson. , , j i_ t> i %0a%0a31 aTu.c. 411.

Kigorous %0alaws were, however, enacted, to maintain the lofty glories of %0athis wreath, by which it was placed upon an equality even %0awith the supreme honours of the wreath that is given by %0aGreece in presence of Jove^ himself, and to receive which the %0aexulting city of the victor is wont to break** a passage through %0aits very walls. These laws are to the effect that the life of a %0afellow-citizen must be preserved, and an enemy slain ; that %0athe spot where this takes place must have been held by the %0aenemy that same day ; that the person saved shall admit the %0afact, other witnesses being of no use at all ; and that the person %0asaved shall have been a Roman citizen. %0a%0aTo preserve an ally merely, even though it should be the %0alife of a king that is so saved, confers no right to this high re- %0award, nor is the honour at all increased, even if it is the %0aEoman general that has been thus preserved, it being the in- %0atention of the framers of the law that it should be the status %0aof the citizen that is everything. When a man has received %0athis wreath, it is his privilege to wear it for the rest of his %0alife. When he makes his appearance at the celebration of the %0agames, it is customary for the Senate even to rise from their %0aseats, and he has the right of taking his seat next to the senators. %0aExemption, too, from all civic duties is conferred upon him as %0awell as his father and his father's father. Siccius Dentatus, as we %0ahave already mentioned on an appropriate occasion, received %0afourteen civic crowns, and Manlius Capitolinus^'' six,^* one, %0aamong the rest, for having saved the life of his general, Ser- %0avilius. Scipio Africanus declined to accept the civic crown %0afor having saved the life of his father at the battle of Trebia. %0aTimes these, right worthy of our everlasting admiration, %0awhich accorded honour alone as the reward of exploits so %0ai^igtty, and wliich, while other crowns were recommended by %0abeing made of gold, disdained to set a price upon the safety of %0aa citizen, and loudly proclaimed thereby that it is unrighteous %0ato save the life of a man for motives of lucre. %0a%0a33 At the Olympic games celebrated in honour of Jupiter.

THIRTEEN VAEIETIES OF THE ACORN. %0a%0aIt is a well-known fact that acorns at this very day con- %0astitute the wealth of many nations, and that, too, even amid %0athese times of peace. Sometimes, also, when there is a scarcity %0aof corn they are dried and ground, the meal being employed %0afor making a kind of bread. Even to this very day, in the %0aprovinces of Spain,*" we find the acorn introduced at table in %0athe second course : it is thought to be sweeter when roasted %0ain the ashes. By the law of the Twelve Tables, there is a %0aj)rovision made that it shall be lawful for a man to gather his %0aacorns when they have fallen upon the land of another. %0a%0aThe varieties of the glandiferous trees are numerous, and %0athey are found to difter in fruit, locality, sex, and taste ; the %0aacorn of the beech having one shape, that of the quercus %0aanother, and that, again, of the holm-oak another. The various %0aspecies also, among themselves, offer a considerable number of %0avarieties. In addition to this, some of these trees are of a %0awild nature, while the fruits of others are of a less acrid %0aflavour, owing to a more careful cultivation. Then, too, there %0ais a difference between the varieties which grow on the moun- %0atains and those of the plains; the males differ from the %0afemales, and there are considerable modifications in the flavour %0aof their fruit. That of the beech ''^ is the sweetest of all ; so %0amuch so, that, according to Cornelius Alexander, the people of %0athe city of Chios, when besieged, supported themselves wholly %0aon mast. The different varieties cannot possiblj' be distin- %0aguished by their respective names, which vary according to %0a%0a" Glandes." Under this name, for which wc do not appear to have any %0aEnglish equivalent, were included, as already mentioned, not only tlie %0aacorn of the oak, but the nut or mast of the ficech, and probably most of %0athe hard or kernel fruits. In the present instance Pliny probably alludes %0aonly to the fruit of the oak and the beech. Acorns are but little used as %0aan article of food in these days. Roasted, they have been proposed as a %0asubstitute for coffee. %0a%0aThe acorn of the Quercus ballota of Linnneus is probably meant, which %0ais still much used in the province of Salamanca, and forms an ajrreeable %0aarticle of food. This acorn, Fee says, contains a considerable proportion %0aof saccharine matter, and is better roasted in the ashes than boiled in water. %0aIt is not, however, used as a dessert, as in the time of the Romans. These %0aacorns are sold at market in Andalusia in the month of October. %0a%0a" So far as it goes, the kernel of the mast or beech-nut is not unpa- %0alatable ; but in the English beech it is very diminutive. %0a%0a%0a%0a346 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's natural histobt. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0atheir several localities. The quercus" and the robur" we %0asee growing everj^where, but not so with the acsculus while %0aa fourth kind, known as the cerrus," is not so much us known %0athroughout the greater part of Italy. We shall distinguish %0athem,^ therefore, by their characteristic features, and when %0acircumstances render it necessary, shidl give their Greek names %0aus well. %0a%0aCHAP. 7. (6.) THE BEECH. %0a%0aThe acorn of the beech is similar in appearance to a kernel, %0aenclosed in a shell of triangular shape. The leaf is thin and %0aone of the very lightest, is similar in appearance to that of the %0apoplar, and turns yellow with remarkable rapidity. From the %0amiddle of the leaf, and upon the upper side of it, there mostly %0ashoots a little green berry, with a pointed top.^' The beech is %0aparticularly agreeable to rats and mice ; and hence it is, that %0awhere this tree abounds, those creatures are sure to be plen- %0atiful also. The leaves are also very fattening for dormice, %0aand good for thrushes too. Almost all trees bear an average %0acrop but once in two years ; this is the case with the beech %0amore particularly. %0a%0aCHAP. 8. THE OTHER ACOENS — WOOD TOIL FtTEL. %0a%0aThe other trees that bear acorns, properly so called, are the %0a%0aThe word " quercus " is frequently used as a general name for the %0aoak ; but throughout the present Hook it is most employed as meaning a %0adistinct variety of the oak, one of the larger kinds, i ke says, and answering %0ato the Quercus racemosa of Lamarck, the Quercus robur of Linnaeus, and %0athe Rouvre of the French. %0a%0a" This also has been much employed as a general name for the oak ; but %0ahere, and in other parts of this Book, it is applied to one variety. Fee %0athinks that it answers to the Quercus sessiliflora of Smith, sometimes also %0acalled " rouvre" by the French. %0a%0aThe Quercus aesculus of Linnaeus. It is not improbable that this oak %0ais a different tree from the "iEsculus " of Horace and Virgil, which was %0aperhaps either a walnut, or a variety of the beech. %0a%0a^5 It has been suggested that this is the same with the Quercus cerrus of %0aLinnajus, and the Quercus crinita of Lamarck, the gland of which is placed %0ain a prickly cupule. It is rarely found in France, but is often to be met %0avrith. in Piedmont and the Apennines. %0a%0a^ The Fagus silvatica of Lamarck. Its Latin name, "fagus," is supposed %0ato have been derived from the Greek ^aya>, " to eat." An oil is extracted %0afrom the acorns or nuts, that is much used in some parts of France. %0a%0a« He speaks probably of one of the galls which are found attached to %0athe leaves of the forest trees. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 8.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE OTnEU AC0BN3. %0a%0a%0a%0a347 %0a%0a%0a%0arobur, the oesculus, the cemis, the holm-oak/« and the cork- %0atree it is contained in a rivelled calyx, which embraces %0amore or less of it, according to the several varieties. The %0aleaves of these trees, those of the holm-oak excepted, are %0aweighty, pulpy, long, and jagged at the edges, and they do %0anot turn yellow before they fall, as with the beech : they are %0aalso longer or shorter, as the case may be. %0a%0aThere are two kinds ^* of holm-oak : one of them, which %0abelongs to Italy, has a leaf not very unlike that of the olive ; %0aBome of the Greeks give it the name of " milax,"*' and in our %0aprovinces it is known as the aquifolia. The acorn of these %0atwo kinds is shorter and more slender than in the others : %0aHomer'- calls it " acylos," and by that name distinguishes it %0afrom the ordinary acorn : it is generally said that the male %0atree of the holm-oak bears no fruit. %0a%0aThe best acorn, and the very largest, is that which grows %0aupon the quercus, and the next to it is the fruit of the jescu- %0alus : that of the robur, again, is diminutive, and the fruit of %0athe cerrus has a meagre, wretched look, being enclosed in a %0acalyx covered with prickles, like the outer coat of the ches- %0anut. With reference to the acorn of the quercils, that which %0agrows upon the female tree*^ is sweeter and more tender, %0awhile that of the male is more solid and compact. The acorn, %0ahowever, of the latifolia'* is the most esteemed, an oak so %0a%0a" " Ilex." Fee thinks that the varieties known as the Prinos and the %0aBallota were often confounded by the ancients with the " ilex " or " holm- %0aoak." Tiiis tree, he says, bears no resemblance to the ordinary oak, except %0ain the blossoms and the fruit. It is the Ilex of Linnaeus, the " yeuse," or %0a"green oak," of the French. %0a%0a" The Quercus suber of Linnaeus ; it is found more particularly in the %0adepartment of the Landes in France. %0a%0a^ As Fee remarks, Pliny is clearly in error here; one kind being the %0averitable ilex or holm oak, the other, the aquifolium or holly, quite a dif- %0afcrcnt tree %0a%0a" The smilax or milax wasareal holm oak,but the aquifolia was the holly. %0a%0a'2 Od. xi. 242. Fee remarks that the berry of the holly has no resem- %0ablance to the acorn whatever, and he says that this statement of Pliny al- %0amost leads him to think that the second variety here mentioned by him was %0anot in reality the holly, but a variety of the quercus. %0a%0a" Fee observes that, properly speaking, there is no sex in the oak, the %0aindividuals being neither male nor female. The Flora Damca however, as %0ahe observes, gives the name of " Quercus fcemina" to the Quercus racemosa %0aof Lamarck. - , ^ -i- %0a%0a^ Or "broad-leaved" oak; one of the varieties of the Quercus sessih- %0a%0aflora of Smith— i%25r.

The acorns %0adiffer also among themselves in size, and the comparative %0afineness of the outer shell ; as also in the circumstance that %0asome have beneath the shell a rough coat of a rusty colour, %0awhile in others a white flesh immediately presents itself. %0aThose, too, are more particularly esteemed, the two extre- %0amities of the nut of which, taken lengthwise, are as hard as a %0astone : and it is considered preferable that this peculiarity %0ashould present itself rather in the shell than in the flesh : in %0acither case, however, it only exists in the fruit of the male tree. %0aIn some kinds, again, the acorn is oval, in others round ; %0awhile in others it is of a more pointed form. The colour, too, %0avaries considerably, according as it is blacker or whiter ; this %0alast being held in the highest esteem. The extremities of the %0aacorn are bitter, but the flesh in the middle of it is sweet;" %0aanother difference, too, consists in the comparative length or %0ashortness of the stalk. %0a%0aAs for the trees themselves, the one that bears the acorn of %0alargest size is known as the "hemeris;"^ a small tree with %0aa thick bushy foliage all ai'ound it, and often hollowed at the %0aplace where the branch is joined to the trunk. The quercus %0ahas a stronger wood, and less susceptible of decay : this also is %0aa very branchy tree, but is much taller than the last, while %0athe trunk is considerably thicker. The jegilops," however, is %0athe highest of them all, and is much attached to wild, unculti- %0avated spots. Next to this in height is the lati folia, but its %0awood is far from being so useful either for building purposes %0aor for charcoal. When rough-hewn it is very apt to spoil, %0ahence it is that it is generally used in an unhewn state. Ah %0acharcoal, it is considered only economical in smelting copper ; %0afor the moment the workman ceases to blow, the fire dies out, %0aand hence it requires to be repeatedly rekindled ; while at the %0asame time it gives out great quantities of sparks. The best %0a%0a^ This statement is contrary to general experience in modern times, %0atlie flavour of tlic acorn being uniformly acrid and bitter throughout.

In %0aaddition to this, it is very frequently struck by lightning, %0aalthough it is not so remarkably lofty in height: for this %0areason it is not considered lawful to employ its wood for the %0apurposes of sacrifice. It is but rarely that it bears any acorns, %0aand when it does they are bitter : no animal will touch them, %0awith the sole exception of swine, and not even they, if they %0acan get any other food. An additional reason also for its ex- %0aclusion from all religious ceremonials, is the circumstance %0athat the fire is very apt to go out in the middle of the %0asacrifice when the wood of it is used for fuel. %0a%0aThe acorn of the beech, when given to swine,^ makes them %0abrisk and lively, and renders the flesh tender for cooking, and %0alight and easy of digestion ; while, on the other hand, that of %0athe holm oak has the effect of making them thin, pallid, %0ameagre, and lumpish. The acorn of the quercus is of a broad %0ashape, and is the heaviest as well as the sweetest of them %0aall. According to Nigidius, the acorn of the cerrus occupies %0athe next rank to this, and, indeed, there is no acorn that %0arenders the flesh of swine more firm, though at the same time %0ait is apt to impart a certain degree of hardness. The same %0aauthor assures us also, that the acorn of the holm oak is a %0atrjang diet for swine, unless it is given in very small qaan- %0a%0a*8 Pliny's account of making charcoal is derived from Theophrnstiis, %0aB. iii. c. 10.

The Greek %0aname signifies the " sea cork tree." %0a%0a^ The statement here given as to the effect of beech-mast on swine, is %0adestitute, Fee remarks, of all foundation. If fed upon it, their flesh will %0anaturally be of a soft, spongy nature. %0a%0a%0a%0a350 PLIKT's NATURAL HISTORY. [Book XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0atitles at a time.

THE GALL-KUT. %0a%0aAll" the glandiferous trees produce the gall-nut as well : %0athey only bear acorns, however, in alternate years. The gall- %0anut of the hemeris"'^ is considered the choicest of all, and the %0abest adapted for the preparation of leather : that of the lati- %0afolia closely resembles it, but is somewhat lighter, and not by %0aany means so highly approved. This last tree produces the %0ablack gall-nut also — for there are two varieties of it — this last %0abeing deemed preferable for dyeing wool. %0a%0a(7.) The gall-nut begins to grow just as the sun is leaving %0athe sign of Gemini,^^ and always bursts forth in its entirety in a %0asingle night.** The white variety grows, too, in a single day, but %0aif the heat happens to overtake it, it shrinks immediately, and %0anever arrives at its proper size, which is about that of a bean. %0aThe black gall-nut w411 remain green for a longer period, and %0asometimes attains the size of an apple*^ even. The best kind is %0athat which comes from Commagene,^* and the most inferior %0aare those produced by the robur : it may easily be tested by %0ameans of certain holes in it which admit of the passage of the %0alight." %0a%0aCHAP. 10. — OTHEE PRODUCTIONS ON THESE TllEES BESIDES THE %0aACOEN. %0a%0aThe rohxir, in addition to its fruit, has a great number of %0aother productions : it bears** the tw^o varieties of the gall-nut, %0a%0a^1 This assertion is perhaps too general ; gall-nuts are produced in very %0asmall quantities by the holm-oak. %0a%0a^2 A variety of the Quercus racemosa, which produces the green gall- %0anut of Aleppo, considered in modern, as in ancient, times the choicest in %0aquality. %0a%0aTheophrastus says the end of June, %0afi* Its growth, in I'eality, is not so rapid as this. %0a^5 Such a thing is never seen at the present day. %0a^ In Syria.

Little %0aballs'" also are found growing on the robur, not unlike nuts in %0aappearance, and containing within them a kind of soft wool, %0awhich is used for burning in lamps ; for it will keep burning %0awithout oil, which is the case also with the black gall-nut. %0aIt bears another kind, too, of little ball, covered with hair," but %0aused for no purpose: in spring, however, this contains a juice like %0ahoney. In the hollows formed by the union of the trunk and %0abranches of this tree there are found also small round balls,'^ %0awhich adhere bodily to the bark, and not by means of a stalk : %0aat the point of junction they are white, but the rest of the %0abody is spotted all over with black : inside they are of a scarlet %0acolour, but on opening them they are found to be empty, and %0aare of a bitter taste. %0a%0aSometimes, too, the robur bears a kind of pumico,^^ as well %0aas little balls, which are formed of the leaves rolled up ; upon %0athe veins of the leaves, too, there are watery pustules, of a %0awhitish hue, and transparent while they are soft ; in these a %0akind of gnat'* is produced, and they come to maturity just in %0athe same way that the ordinaiy gall-nut does. %0a%0aCHAP, 11.

It is harder than wood, and contains cells, in which the larva of the %0ainsect lies coiled up. . . j i. j n %0a%0aThis is a proof, as Fee remarks, that the ancients had observed the %0aexistence of the cynips ; though, at the same time, it is equally evident %0athat they did not know the important part it acts m the formation of the %0a%0aThis word, as employed by Theophrastus, means a catkin, the Julus %0a%0a%0a%0a352 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLINY's NATUBAIi UISTOUY.

It grows on the fir likewise, the larch, %0athe pitch-tree, the linden, the nut-tree, and the plane, and %0aremains on the tree throughout the winter, after the leaves have %0afallen. It contains a kernel very similar to that of the pine- %0anut, and increases in size during the winter. In spring the %0aball opens throughout, and it fiially drops when the leaves %0aare beginning to grow. %0a%0aSuch is the multiplicity of the products borne by the robur %0ain addition to its acorns ; and not only these, but mushrooms'' %0aas well, of better or worse quality, the most recent stimulants %0athat have been discovered for the appetite ; these last are found %0agrowing about its roots. Those of the quercus are the most %0ahighly esteemed, while those of the robur, the cypress, and %0athe pine are injurious." The robur produces mistletoe"* also, %0aand, if we may believe Hesiod," honey as well : indeed, it is %0aa well-known lkct,that a honey*^-like dew falling from heaven, as %0awe have already mentioned,**' deposits itself upon the leaves of %0athis tree in preference to those of any other. It is also well %0aknown that the wood of this tree, when burnt, produces u %0anitrous*^ ash. %0a%0aamentum of the botanists ; but it is doubtful if Pliny attaches this meaning %0ato the word, as the lime or linden-tree has no catkin, but an inflorescence %0aof a different character. It is not improbable that, under this name, he %0aalludes to some excrescence. %0a%0aThese were the " boletus" and the " suillus ;" the last of which seem %0aonly to have been recently introduced at table in the time of Pliny. See %0aE. xxii. c. 47. %0a%0aHe alludes clearly to funri of radically different qualities, as the na- %0ature of th§ trees beneath which they grow cannot possibly influence them, %0aany further than by the various proportions of shade they afford. The soil, %0ahowever, exercises great influence on the quality of the fungus ; growing %0aupon a hill, it may be innoxious, while in a wet soil it may be productive %0aof death.

In this number %0athere are the pine' and the pinaster," which have long thin %0aleaves like hair, and pointed at the end. The pine yields the %0aleast resin of them all : in the pine nut, indeed, of which we %0ahave previously spoken,^ it is sometimes to be found, but %0ahardly in sufficient quantities to warrant us in reckoning tlie %0apine among the resinous trees. %0a%0aCHAP. 17. — THE PINASTEK. %0a%0aThe pinaster is nothing else but a wild pine : it rises to a %0asurprising height, and throws out branches from the middle, %0ajust as the pine does from the top. This tree yields a more %0acopious supply of resin than the pine : the mode in Avhich this %0ais done we shall set forth on a future occasion. It grows %0aalso in flat countries. Many people think that this is the %0asame tree that grows along the shores of Italy, and is known %0aas the " tibulus ;" ^' but this last is slender, and more com- %0apact than the pine ; it is likewise free from knots, and hence %0ais used in the construction of light gallies they are both almost %0aentirely destitute of resin. %0a%0aCHAP. 18. — THE PITCn-TKEE : THE FIE. %0a%0aThe pitch-tree loves the mountain heights and cold loca- %0alities.

Fee says that there is little %0adoubt that this pretended fruit was merely a resinous secretion, which %0ahardens and assumes the form of a fig. %0a%0a*2 He somewhat mistranslates a passage of Theophrastus here, who, %0awithout transforming the larch into another tree, says that it is a sign of %0adisease in the larch, when its secretions are augmented to such a degree %0athat it seems to turn itself into resin. %0a%0aThe lamp-black of commerce is made from the soot of the pine. %0a%0aThis statement, though supported by that of Vitruvius, V,. ii. c. 9, is %0aquite erroneous. The wood of the larch gives out more heat than that of %0athe fir, and produces more live coal in proportion. %0a^ This, Fee remarks, is the fact. %0a%0a^ This description is inexact, and we should have some difficulty in %0arecognizing here the larch as known to us. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 19.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTUE LAUCII. %0a%0a%0a%0a359 %0a%0a%0a%0athe roots are once burnt, will not throw out fresh Bhoots, %0awhich the pitch-tree will do, as was found to be the case in the %0aisland of Lesbos, after the Pyrrhajan grove had been burnt %0athere. %0a%0aIn the same species too, the variety of sex" is found to con- %0astitute a considerable difference : the male is the shorter tree, %0aand has a harder wood ; while the female is taller, and bears a %0aleaf more unctuous to the feel, smooth and free from all %0arigidity. The wood of the male tree is hard and awry, and %0aconsequently not so well suited for carpenters' work ; while %0athat of the female is softer, as may be very easily perceived on %0athe application of the axe, a test, in fact, which, in every %0avariety, immediately shows us which trees are males ; the axe %0ain such case meeting with a greater resistance, falling with %0aa louder noise, and being withdrawn from the wood with con- %0asiderably greater diflSculty : the wood of the male tree is more %0aparched too, and the root is of a blacker hue. In the vicinity of %0aMount Ida, in Troas, the circumstance whether the tree grows %0ain the mountain districts or on the sea-shoro, makes another %0aconsiderable difference. In Macedonia and Arcadia, and in tho %0aneighbourhood of Elis, the names of the several varieties have %0abeen totally altered, and it has not been agreed by authors %0awhich name ought to be given to each : we have, therefore, %0acontented ourselves with employing the Eoman denominations %0asolely. %0a%0aThe fir is the largest of them all, the female being the taller %0aof the two ; the wood7 too, is softer and more easily worked. %0aThis tree is of a rounder form than the otliers, and its leaves %0aare closely packed and feathered, so as not to admit of the %0apassage of rain ; the appearance, too, of the tree is altogether %0amore cheerful. From the branches of these different varieties, %0awith the sole exception of the larch,'^^ ^i^ere hang numbers of %0ascaly nuts of compact shape, like so many catkins. The nuts %0afound upon the male fir hare a kernel in the fore-part, which is %0a%0a" riiny IS in error here, there hcing no distinction of sex in the coni- %0aferous trees. All that he relates relative to the differences between the %0amale and female pine is consequently false. He has, however, m this in- %0astance, only perpetuated an erroneous opinion of 1 heoplirastus. %0a%0a28 This 4 an erroneous statement. Tlie larch has its cone, as well as %0athe rest. It is possible, however, that its small size may have caused it tu %0abe overlooked by Pliny. %0a%0a%0a%0a360 %0a%0a%0a%0aPLI>r'3 NATURAL HISTOUr. %0a%0a%0a%0ariJook XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0anot the case with those on the female tree. In the pitch-tree, %0aagain, these kernels, which arc very small and black, occupy %0athe whole of the catkin, which is smaller and more slender %0athan in the other varieties ; hence it is that the Greeks call %0athis tree by the name of phthirophoron.-" In this tree, too, the %0anuts on the male are more compressed, and less moist with %0aresin. %0a%0aCHAP. 20. — THE YEW. %0a%0aNot to omit any one of them, the yew is similar to these %0aotlier trees in general appearance. It is of a colour, however, %0abut slightly apiiroaching to green, and of a slender i'orm; of %0asombre and ominous aspect, and quite destitute of juice : it is %0athe only one, too, among them all, that bears a berry. In the %0amale tree the fruit is injurious ; indeed, in Spain more particu- %0alarly, the berries contain a deadly poison.^^ It is an ascertained %0afact that travellers' vessels,^- made in Gaul of this wood, for the %0apurpose of holding wine, have caused the death of those who %0aused them. Sextius says, that in Greece this tree is known by %0athe name of " smilax," and that in Arcadia it is possessed of so %0aactive a poison, that those who sleep beneath it, or even take %0afood'*^ there, are sure to meet their death from it. There are %0aauthors, also, who assert that the poisons which we call at %0athe present day " toxica," and in which arrows are dipped, %0awere formerly called taxica,^^ from this tree. It has been %0adiscovered, also, that those poisonous qualities are quite neu- %0atralized by driving a copper nail into the wood of the tree. %0a%0a29 Or " louse-bearing." As Fee says, it is difficult to see the analogy. %0a^0 The Taxus baccata of Linnceus. The account here given is in general %0avery correct. %0a%0a31 It is supposed that Pliny derives this notion as to the yew berry from %0aJuhus Caesnr, who says that " Cativulcus killed himself with the yew, a %0atree which grows in great abundance in Gaul and Germany."

The same resin, if boiled gently %0awith water, and then strained off, becomes viscous, and assumes %0aa red colour; it is then known as "distilled" pitch:" for %0amaking this, the refuse portions of the resin and the bark of %0athe tree arc generally selected. %0a%0aAnother method is adopted for the manufacture of that used %0aas crapula."

These are then pounded'^ down and passed through a %0asieve, after which they are steeped in water, which is heated %0atill it comes to a boil. The unctuous portion that is extracted %0afrom this is the best resin : it is but rarely to be met with, %0aand then only in a few places in Italy, in the vicinity of the %0aAlps : it is in considerable request for medicinal purposes. %0aFor this, they generally boil a congius of white resin to two %0acongii of rain-water : " some persons, however, think it better" %0ato boil it without water for one whole day by a slow fire, %0ataking care to use a vessel of white copper.'"

(12.)— HOW THE KESIN CALLED ZOPISSA IS PREPARED. %0a%0aWe must not omit, too, that the Greeks call by the name of %0azopissa** the pitch mixed with wax which has been scraped %0afrom off the bottoms of sea-going ships for there is nothing, %0ain fact, that has been left untried by mankind. This composi- %0ation is found much more efficient for all those purposes in %0awhich pitch and resin are employed, in consequence of the %0asuperior hardness which has been imparted to it by the sea- %0asalt. %0a%0aThe pitch-tree is opened on the side that faces the sun, %0anot by means of an incision, but of a wound made by the re- %0amoval of the bark : this opening being generally two feet in %0awidth and one cubit from the ground, at the very least. The %0abody of the tree, too, is not spared in this instance, as in others, %0afor even the very chips from off it are considered as having %0atheir use ; those, however, from tlie lower part of the tree are %0alooked upon as the best, the wood of the higher parts giving %0athe resin a bitter" taste. In a short time all the resinojis %0ajuices of the entire tree come to a point of confluence in the %0awound so inflicted : the same process is adopted also with the %0atorch-tree. When the liquid ceases to flow, the tree is opened %0ain a similar manner in some other part, and then, again, else- %0awhere : after which the whole tree is cut down, and the pith** %0aof it is used for burning.*' %0a%0aSo, too, in Syria they take the bark from off the terebinth ; %0aand, indeed, in those parts they do not spare even the root or %0abranches, although in general the resin obtained from those %0aparts is held in disesteem.

The best pitch** %0aeverj-wherc is that obtained from trees planted on sunny spots %0awith a north-east aspect ; while that Avhich is produced from %0amore shaded localities has a disagreeable look and a repulsive %0aodour. Pitch, too, that is produced amid the cold of winter is %0aof inferior quality, being in smaller quantity, too, and compara- %0atively colourless. Some persons are of opinion that in moun- %0atainous localities this liquid is produced in the greatest abun- %0adance, and that it is of superior colour and of a sweeter taste %0aand has a finer smell so long as it remains in a state of resin ; %0abut that when, on the other hand, it is subjected to boiling, it %0ayields a smaller quantity of pitch, because so much of it goes" %0aoff in a serous shape. They say that the resinous trees, too, %0athat grow on mountains are thinner than those that are found %0aon plains, but that they are apt, both of them, to be unpro- %0aductive in clear, diy weather. %0a%0a, Some trees, too, afford a flow of resinous juice the year after %0athe incision is made, some, again, in the second year, and %0aothers in the third. The wound so made is filled with resin, %0abut not with bark, or by the cicatrization of the outer coat ; %0afor the bark in this tree never unites. Among these varie- %0aties some authors have made the sappium" to constitute a %0apeculiar kind, because it is produced from the seed of a kin- %0adred variety, as we have already stated when speaking of the %0anuts** of trees ; and they have given the name of txda.^ to %0athe lower parts of the tree ; although in reality this tree is no- %0athing else but a pitch-tree, Avhich by careful cultivation has %0alost some small portion of its wild character.

(13.)— TUKEs tok wood of wnicu is highly valued. %0a%0aFOUR VAEIETIES OF THE ASH. %0a%0aIt is for the sake of their timber that Nature has created the %0aother trees, and more particularly the ash/* whieh yields it in %0agreater abundance. This is a tall, tapering tree, with a %0afeather-hke leaf: it has been greatly ennobled by the enco- %0amiums of Homer, and the fact that it formed the spear of %0aAcliillcs the wood of it is employed for numerous purposes. %0aTlic ash which grows upon Mount Ida, in Troas, is so ex- %0atremely like the cedar,™ that, when the bark is removed, it %0a■will deceive a purchaser. %0a%0aThe Greeks have distinguished two varieties of this tree, %0athe one long and without knots, the other short, with a harder %0awood, of a darker colour, and a leaf like that of the laurel. %0aIn Macedonia they give the name of "bumelia"'' to an ash %0aof remarkably large size, with a wood of extreme flexibility. %0aSome authors have divided this tree into several varieties, ac- %0acording to the localities which it inhabits, and say that the %0aash of the plains has a spotted wood, while that of the moun- %0atain ash is more compact. Some Greek writers have stated %0athat the leaf of the ash is poisonous" to beasts of burden, but %0aharmless to all the animals that ruminate." The leaves of %0athis tree in Italy, however, are not injurious to beasts of bur- %0aden even ; so far from it, in fact, that nothing has been found %0ato act as so good a specific for the bites of serpents'" as to drink %0athe juice extracted from the leaves, and to apply them to the %0awounds. So great, too, are the virtues of this tree, that no %0aserpent will ever lie in the shadow thrown by it, either in the %0a%0a® He (Iocs not speak in tliis place of the "ornus" or "mountain ash;" %0anor, as Fee obst i ves, does be mention the use of the bark of the ash as a %0afebrifuge, or of its leaves as a purgative. This ash is the Fraxinus ex- %0acelsior of Dccandolles. «9 II. xxiv. 277. %0a%0aPliny makes a mistake here, in copying from Theopbrastus, who says %0athat it is the yew that boars so strong a resemblance to the cedar. %0a%0a" Or "buU's-ash." This variety does not seem to have been identified. %0a%0a" This statement results from his misinterpretation of the language of %0aTbeophrastus, who is really speaking of the yew, which Pliny mistakes %0ator tlic ash. %0a%0a" Miller asserts that, if given to cows, this leaf will impart a bad flavour %0ato the milk ; a statement which, Fee says, is quite incorrect. %0a%0a'* A merely fanciful notion, without apparently the slightest foundation : %0athe same, too, may be said of tlie alleged antipathy of the serpent to the %0abeech-tree, which is neither venomous nor odoriferous. %0a%0a%0a%0a366 %0a%0a%0a%0aplint's katubal history.

By a wonderful provision %0aof Nature, the ash has been made to blossom before the ser- %0apents leave their holes, and the fall of its leaf does not take %0aplace till after they have retired for the winter. %0a%0aCHAP. 25. (14.) — TWO VAEIETIES OF THE LINDEN-TEEE. %0a%0aIn the linden-tree the male" and the female are totally dif- %0aferent. In the male the wood is hard and knotty, of a redder %0ahue, and Avith a stronger smell ; the bark, too, is thicker, and, %0awhen taken off, has no flexibility. The male bears neither %0aseed nor blossom as the female docs, the trunk of which is %0athicker, and the wood white and of excellent quality. It is a %0asingular" thing, but no animal will touch the fruit of this %0atree, although the juice of the leaves and the bark is sweet. %0aBetween the bark and the wood there are a number of thin %0acoats, formed by the union of numerous fine membranes ; of %0athese they make those bands'* which are known to us as "tUiae." %0aThe finer membranes are called "philyra3," and are rendered %0afamous by the honourable mention that the ancients have %0amade of them as ribbons for wreaths'® and garlands. The %0a%0a''^ This story of Pliny has been corroborated by M. de Verone, and as %0astrongly contradicted by Camerarius and Charras : with M. Fee, then, we %0amust leave it to the reader to judge which is the most likely to be speaking %0athe truth. It is not improbable that Pliny may have been imposed upon, %0aas his credulity would not at all times preclude him from being duped. %0a%0aThere is no such distinction in the linden or lime, as the flowers are %0ahermaphroditical. They are niurely two varieties : the male of Pliny being %0atlie Tilia microphylla of Dccandolles, and a variety of the Tilia Europaa %0aof Linnaeus ; and the female being the Tilia platyphyllos, another variety %0aof the Tilia Europaea of Linnteus. %0a%0a" Not at all singular, Fee says, the fruit being dry and insipid. %0a%0a" In France these cords are still made, and are used for well-ropes, %0awheat-sheafs, &c.

(15.) TEN VABIETIES Of THE MAPLE. %0a%0aThe naaple, which is pretty nearly of the sarae«= size as the %0alime, is inferior to the citrus*' only for the beauty of its wood %0awhen employed for cabinet work, and the exquisite finish it %0aadmits of. There are numerous varieties'** of this tree ; the %0alight maple, remarkable for the extreme whiteness of its wood, %0ais known as the " Gallic" maple in Italy beyond the Padus, %0abeing a native of the countries beyond tlie Alps. Another %0akind is covered with w^avy spots running in all directions. %0aIn consequence of its superior beauty it has received its name,^ %0afrom its strong resemblance to the marks which are seen in %0athe tail of the peacock ; the finest kinds are those which grow %0ain Istria and Ilhaetia. An inferior sort of maple is known as %0a"crassivenium."'*' %0a%0aThe Greeks distinguish the varieties according to their re- %0aspective localities. The maple of the plains,'*" they say, is %0awhite, and not wavy; they give it the name of " glinon." %0aOn the other hand, the mountain maple,**" they say, is of a %0amore variegated appearance, and harder, the wood of the male %0atree being more particularly so, and the best adapted for spc- %0a%0a" Teredo." If he moans under this name to inchide the tinea as %0awell, the assertion is far too general, us this wood is eaten away by insects, %0athough more slowly than the majority of the non-resinous woods. It is %0atiDnietimes perforated quite through by the larva of the byrrhus, our death- %0awatch. %0a%0a*' This is incorrect. It attains a very considerable height, and some- %0atimes an enormous size. Tlie trunk is known to grow to as much as forty %0aor fifty feet in circumforeneo. %0a%0aThe maple is much less in size than what the lime or linden really is. %0a^-'i See B. xiii. c. 29. %0a%0aFee says there are but five varieties of the maple known in France. %0aHe doubts wliether tlie common maple, the Acer canipestrc of Linnaeus, %0awas known to the ancients. %0a%0aFee identifies it with the Acer pseudo-platanus of LinniBus, the Acer %0amontanum candidum of C.

These are both of them tuberosities of tliis tree, the %0abruscum presenting veins more violently contorted, while those %0aof the molluscum are disposed in a more simple and uniform %0amanner : indeed, if this last were of sufficiently large size to %0aadmit of tables being made of it, there is no doubt that it %0awould be preferred to the wood of the citrus even.

The tamarisk of the moderns is not an evergreen, %0awhich has caused writers to doubt if it is identical with the timariscus of %0atlie ancients, and to be disposed to look for it among the larger ericiE or %0aheaths.

It is an erroneous theory %0athat the leaf does not fall in those trees the juices of which %0aare more unctuous than the rest ; for who could make out that %0asuch is the case with the holm-oak, for instance ? Timjeus, %0athe mathematician, is of opinion that the leaves fall while the %0aBun is passing through the sign of Scorpio, being acted upon by %0athe influences of that luminary, and a certain venom which %0aexists in the atmosphere : but then we have a right to wonder %0ahow it is that, the same reasons existing, the same influence %0ais not exercised equally on all. %0a%0aThe leaves of most trees fall in autumn, but in some at a %0alater period, remaining on the tree till the approach of winter, %0ait making no difference whether they have germinated at an %0aearlier period or a later, seeing that some that are the very %0afirst to bud are among the last to lose their leaves — the %0aalmond, the ash, and the elder, for instance : the mulberry, %0aon the other hand, buds the last of all, and loses its leavi s %0aamong the very first. The soil, too, exercises a very consi- %0aderable influence in this respect : the leaves falling sooner %0awhere it is dry and thin, and more particularly when the tree %0ais old : indeed, there are many trees that lose them before the %0afruit is ripe, as in the case of the late fig, for instance, and the %0awinter pear : on the pomegranate, too, the fruit, when ripe, %0abeholds nothing but the trunk of the parent tree. And not %0aeven upon those trees which always retain theii- foliage do the %0asame leaves always remain, for as others shoot up beneath tliem, %0athe old leaves gradually wither away : this takes place about %0athe solstices more particularly. %0a%0aCHAP. 35.

Then it is that they %0ashow themselves quite renewed, and altogether different from %0aAvhat they really are ; then it is that they quite revel in the con- %0atest with each other which shall excel in tho various hues %0aand tints which they display. This merit has, however, been %0adenied to many of them ; for they do not all blossom, and %0athere are certain sombre trees which do not participate in this %0ajoyous season of the year. The holm-oak, the pitch-tree, the %0alarch, and the pine are never bedecked with blossoms, and %0awith them there is no particular forerunner sent forth to an- %0anounce the yearly birth of their respective fruits. The same %0aIS the case, too, with the cultivated and the wild fig,'» which %0aimmediately present their fruit in place of any blossom. Upon %0athe fig, too, it is remarkable that there are abortive fruit to be %0aseen which never ripen. %0a%0aThe juniper, also, is destitute of blossom; some writers, %0ahowever, distinguish two varieties of it, one of which blossoms %0abut bears no fruit,^" while the other has no blossom, but pre- %0asents the berries immediately, which remain on the tree %0ator 80 long a period as two years : this assertion, however, is %0a%0a" This statement, as also that relative to the holm oak, and other trees %0apreviously mentioned, is quite incorrect.

THE FECUNDATION OF TREES. GEEMINATION : THE %0a%0aAPPEAHANCE OF THE FKUIT. %0a%0aAll trees germinate, however,**' even those which do not %0ablossom. In this respect there is a very considerable differ- %0aence in relation to the various localities; for in the same %0aspecies we find that the tree, when planted in a marshy spot, %0awill germinate earlier than elsewhere ; next to that, the trees %0atiiat grow on the plains, and last of all those that are I'ound in %0athe woods : the wild pear, too, is naturally later in budding %0athan the other pears. At the first breath of the west wind" %0athe cornel buds, and close upon it the laurel ; then, a little %0abefore the equinox, we find the lime and the maple germi- %0anating. Among the earlier trees, too, are the poplar, the elm, %0athe willow, tile alder, and the nut-trees. The plane buds, %0atoo, at an early period. %0a%0aOthers, again, germinate at the beginning of spring, the %0aholly, for instance, the terebinth, the paliurus,"-* the chcsnut, %0aand the glandiferous trees. On the other hand, the apple is %0alate in budding, and the cork-tree the very last of all. Some %0atrees germinate twice, whether it is that this arises from some %0aexuberant fertility of the soil, or from the inviting tempe- %0arature of the atmosphere ; this takes place more particularly %0ain the several varieties of the cereals. Excessive germination, %0ahowever, has a tendency to weaken and exhaust the tree. %0a%0aBesides the spring budding, some trees have naturally an- %0aother budding, which depends upon the influence of their own %0arespective constellations,**' a theory which we shall find an %0a«' These remarks, borrowed from Thcophrastus, are generally consis- %0atent with our ex pe' ieneo. „, , f %0a«^ Fee remarks that Pliny here copies from Thcophrastus. a wntor ot %0a(Jreeee, without making allowance for the difference ol localities. 1 ico- %0aplirastus, however, gives the laurel an. earlier period for budding than %0aPliny does. %0a%0aThe Rbaninus paliurus of Linnaeus. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0aneai'cr tiie roots. %0a%0a%0a%0a382 %0a%0a%0a%0aPliny's natural uistort.

Some persons think that these %0atwo buddings are common to all trees, but that they are to be %0aremarked more particularly in the fig, the vine, and the pome- %0agranate ; seeing that, when this is the case, the crop of figs, in %0aThessaly and Macedonia more particularly, is remarkably abun- %0adant: but it is in Egypt more especially that illustrations of %0athis vast abundance are to be met with. All the trees in %0ageneral, when they have once begun to germinate, proceed %0acontinuously with it ; the robur, however, the tir-trce, and %0athe larch germinate intermittent!)', ceasing thrice, and as %0amany times*'' beginning to bud again, and hence it is that they %0ashed the scales of their bark ^' three several times; a thing %0athat takes place with all trees during the period of germina- %0ation, the outer coat of the tree bursting Avhile it is budding. %0a%0aWith these last trees the first budding takes place^ at the %0abeginning of spring, and lasts about fifteen days ; and they ger- %0aminate a second time when the sun is passing through the %0asign of Gemini : hence it is that we see the points of the first %0abuds pushed upwards by those beneath, a joint marking the %0aplace where they unite.*'-' The third germination of these %0atrees takes place at the summer solstice, and lasts no more %0athan seven days : at this period we may very distinctly detect %0athe articulations by which the buds are joined to one another %0aas they grow. The vine is the only tree that buds twice ; the %0afirst time when it first puts forth the grape, and the second time %0awhen the grape comes to maturity.

A sucker, liowever, newly devfloped may give birth to buds %0anot at the extremity, but througliout the whole length of it. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 42.] %0a%0a%0a%0aIX WHAT OEDEB TUBES BLOSSOM. %0a%0a%0a%0a383 %0a%0a%0a%0aing of the fruit. Some trees blossom while they are budding, %0aand pass rapidly through that period ; but the fruit is slow in %0acoming to maturity, as in the vine, for instance. Other trees, %0aagain, blossom and bud but late, while the fruit comes to %0araatunty with great rapidity, the mulberry,^" for example, %0awhich is the very last to bud of all the cultivated trees, and %0athen only when the cold weather is gone : for this reason %0ait has been pronounced the wisest among the trees. But in %0athis, the germination, when it has once begun, bursts forth all %0aover the tree at the very same moment; so much so, indeed, %0athat it is accomplished in a single night, and even with a %0anoise that may be audibly heard.*' %0a%0aCHAP. 42. IN WHAT ORDER THE TREES BLOSSOJT. %0a%0aOf the trees which, as we have already stated,*- bud in win- %0ater at the rising of the Eagle, the almond blossoms the first %0aof all, in the mouth of January*^ namely, while by March the %0afruit is well developed. Next to it in blossoming is the plum** %0aof Armenia, and then the tuber and the early peach,'-'^ the first %0atwo being exotics, and the latter forced by the agency of culti- %0avation. Among the forest trees, the first that blossoms in the %0acourse of nature is the elder, *^ which has the most pith of any, %0aand the male cornel, which has none*' at all. Among the %0acultivated trees we next have the apple, and immediately after %0a— so much so, indeed, that it would almost appear that they %0ablossom simultaneously — the pear, the cherry, and the plum. %0aNext to these is the laurel, and then the cypress, and after %0athat the pomegranate and the fig : the vine, too, and the olive %0aare budding when these last trees are in fiower, the period of %0atheir conception'-'* being the rising of the Vergiliae,** that being %0a%0a^ See B. xviii. c. 67.

(26.) — AT WHAT PEKTOD EACH TREE BEARS FRUIT. %0aTHE CORNEL. %0a%0aUpon some trees the fruit does not follow immediately upon %0athe fall of the blossom. The cornel** about the summer sol- %0astice puts forth a fruit that is white at first, and after that %0athe colour of blood. The female* of this tree, after autumn, %0abears a sour berry, which no animal will touch ; its wood, %0atoo, is spongy and quite useless, while, on the otlier liand, that %0aof the male tree is one of the very strongest and hardest® woods %0aknown : so great a difference do we find in trees belonging to %0athe same species. The terebinth, the maple, and the ash pro- %0aduce their seed at harvest-time, while the nut-trees, the apple, %0aand the pear, with the exception of the winter or the more %0aearly kinds, bear fruit in autumn. The glandiferous trees %0abear at a still later period, the setting of the Vergilise,' with %0athe exception of the sesculus,^ which bears in the autumn only ; %0awhile some kinds of the apple and the pear, and the cork-tree, %0abear fruit at the beginning of winter. %0a%0aThe fir puts forth blossoms of a saffron colour about the %0asummer solstice, and the seed is ripe just after the setting of %0athe Vergiliae.

Indeed, there is no tree that %0ais more eager to develope its resources ; for in the same month %0ain which a nut is plucked from it, another will ripen in the %0asame place ; the arrangement being such, that there is no %0amonth in which the nuts of this tree are not ripening.

TREES WHICH LOSE THEIK FRUIT OK FLOWERS MOST %0a%0aKEADILT. %0a%0aYoung trees are unproductive'® so long as they are growing. %0aThe fruits which fall most readily before they come to maturity %0aare the date, the fig, the almond, the apple, the pear, and the %0apomegranate, Avhich last tree is also very apt to lose its blossom %0athrough excessive dews and hoar frosts. For this reason it is, %0atoo, that the growers bend the branches of the pomegranate, lest, %0afrom being straight, they may receive and retain the moisture %0athat is so injurious to them. The pear and the almond, even %0aif it should not rain, but a south wind happen to blow or the %0aweather become cloudy, are apt to lose their blossoms, and their %0afirst fruit as well, if, after the blossom has fallen, there is a %0acontinuance of such weather. Eut it is the willow that loses %0aits seed the most speedily of all, long, indeed, before it is ripe; %0ahence it Is that Homer has given it the epithet of " fruit- %0alosing."^" Succeeding ages, however, have given to this tenu %0aan interpretation conformable to their own wicked practices, it %0abeing a well-known fact that the seed of the willow has the %0aeffect of producing barrenness in females. %0a%0aIn this respect, however, Nature has emploj^ed her usual %0aforesight, bestowing but little care upon the seed of a tree %0awhich is produced so easily, and propagated by slips. There %0ais, however, it is said, one variety of willow,^' the seed of which %0aarrives at maturity : it is found in the Isle of Crete, at the %0adescent from the grotto of J upiter : the seed is unsightly and %0aligneous, and in size about as large as a chick-pea. %0a%0a'8 This miist not be taken to the letter ; indeed, Fee thinks that the %0aproper meaning is;— "Young trees do not produce fruit till they have %0aarrived at a certain state of maturity." Trees mostly continue on the %0aincrease till they die. %0a%0a'9 See B. xvii. c. 2.

This distinction may arise also from the sex : and %0awhen such is the case, it is the male-^ tree that never produces. %0aSome authors, however, making a transposition, assert that it %0ais the male trees only that are prolific. Barrenness may also %0aarise from a tree being too thickly covered with leaves. %0a%0aCHAP. 48. THE MODE IN WHICH TREES BEAR. %0a%0aSome among the fruit -trees bear on both the sides of the %0abranches and the summit, the pear, for instance, the fig- %0atree, and the myrtle. In other respects the trees are pretty %0anearly of a similar nature to the cereals, for in them we find %0athe ear growing from the summit, while in the leguminous %0avarieties the pod grows from the sides. The palm, as we have %0aalready^ stated, is the only one that has fruit hanging down %0ain bunches enclosed in capsules. %0a%0aCHAP. 49. — TREES IN WHICH THE FRUIT APPEARS BEFORE THE %0aLEAVES. %0a%0aThe other trees, again, bear their fruit beneath the leaves, %0afor the purpose of protection, with the exception of the fig, the %0aleaf of which is very large, and gives a great abundance of %0ashade ; hence it is that we find the fruit placed above it ; in %0aaddition to which, the leaf makes its appearance after the fruit. %0aThere is said to be a remarkable peculiarity connected with %0aone species of fig that is found in Cilicia, Cyprus, and Hellas ; %0athe fruit grows beneath the leaves, while at the same time the %0agreen abortive fruit, that never reaches maturity, is seen grow- %0aing on the top of them.

(27.) TREKS THAT BEAB TWO CUOPS IN A TEAR. TREES %0a%0aTHAT BEAB THREE CROPS. %0a%0aIn the island of Cea there are wild figs that bear three times %0ain one year. By the fi.rst crop the one that succeeds is sum- %0amoned forth, and by that the third. It is by the agency of %0athis last crop that caprification^" is performed. In the wild %0afig, too, the fruit grows on the opposite side of the leaves. %0aThere are some pears and apples, too, that bear two crops in %0athe year, while there are some early varieties also. The wild %0aapple bears twice in the year, its second crop coming on after %0athe rising of Arcturus,^" in sunny localities more particularly. %0aThere are vines, too, that will even bear three times in the %0ayear, a circumstance that has procured for them the name of %0a" frantic" " vines. On these we see grapes just ripening, others %0abeginning to swell, and others, again, in blossom, all at the %0asame moment. %0a%0aM. Varro^^ informs us, that there was formerly at Smyrna, %0anear 3^ the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, a vine that bore %0atwo crops in the year, as also an apple-tree of a similar nature %0ain the territory of Consentia. This, however, is constantly to %0abe witnessed in the territory of Tacapa,^* in Africa, of which %0awe shall have to speak more fully on another occasion,^' so %0aremarkable is the fertility of the soil. The cypress also bears %0athree times in the year, for its berries are gathered in the %0a%0a^ Or " forerunner." The Spaniards call a similar fig " brevas," the %0a" ready ripener." %0a%0a27 See B. XV. c. 19. 28 See B. xv. c. 21. %0a%0a-3 This does not happen in the northern climates ; though sometimes it %0ais the case that a fruit-tree blossoms again towards the end of summer, and %0aif the autumn is fine and prolonged, these late fruits will ripen. Such a %0aphenomenon, however, is of very rare occurrence. %0a%0a30 See B. xviii. c. 74. %0a%0a^1 " Insanae." There are some varieties of the vine which blossom more %0athan once, and bear green grapes and fully ripe ones at the same moment. %0aBe Re Bust. c. 7. %0a%0a^ The suggested reading, "apud raatrem magnam," seems preferable %0ato "apud mare," and receives support from what is said relative to Smyrna %0ain B. xiv. c. 6. si See B. v. c. 3. %0a%0a^' B. xviii. c. 51. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 51.] DIFFEEKNCE8 OF TEEES IN EESPECT TO AGE. 389 %0a%0amonths of January, May, and September, being all three of %0adifferent size. %0a%0aThere are also certain peculiarities observed in the different %0amodes in which the trees bear their fruit, the arbutus and the %0aquercus being most fruitful in the upper part, the wabut and %0athe marisca^ fig in the lower. All trees, the older they grow, %0athe more early they bear, and this more particularly in sunny %0aspots and where the soil is not over- rich. AU the forest-trees %0aare slower in bringing their fruit to maturity ; and indeed, in %0asome of them the fruit never becomes fully ripe." Those trees, %0atoo, about the roots of which the earth is ploughed or broken %0aand loosened, bring their fruit to maturity more speedily than %0athose in which this has been neglected ; by this process they %0aare also rendered more fruitful. %0a%0aCHAP. 51. WHICH TREES BECOME OLD WITH THE GREATEST %0a%0aKAPIDITr, AND WHICH MOST SLOWLY. %0a%0aThere are great differences also in trees in respect to age. %0aThe almond and the pear^* are the most fruitful when old, which %0ais the case also with the glandiferous trees and a certaiu spe- %0acies of fig. Others, again, are most prolific when young, %0athough the fruit is later in coming to maturitj^, a thing parti- %0acularly to be observed in the vine ; for in those that are old %0athe wine is of better quality, while the produce of the younger %0atrees is given in greater abundance. The apple-tree becomes %0aold very early, and the fruit which it produces when old is of %0ainferior quality, being of smaller size and very liable to be %0aattacked by maggots : indeed, these insects will breed in the %0atree itself. The fig is the only one of all the fruit-trees that is %0asubmitted to any process with the view of expediting the %0aripening of the fruit, a marvellous thing, indeed, that a greater %0avalue should be set upon produce that comes out of its proper %0aseason ! All trees which bear their fruit before the proper %0atime become prematurely'"' old ; indeed, some of them wither %0a^ B. XV. c. 19. %0a%0a3' This is not the fact : the fruits of all trees have their proper time for %0aripening. %0a%0aHe speaks here in too general terms : the pear, for instance, is not %0amore fruitful when old than when young. %0a%0aHe speaks of the process of caprification.

On the other hand, the mulberry becomes aged" but %0avery slowly, and is never exhausted by its crops. Those trees, %0atoo, the wood of which is variegated, arrive at old age but %0aslowly, — the palm, the maple, and the poplar, for instance. %0a%0a(29.) Trees grow old more rapidly when the earth is %0aploughed and loosened about the^- roots ; forest trees at a later %0aperiod. Speaking in general terms, we may say that care %0aemployed in the culture of trees seems to promote their fer- %0atility, while increased fertility accelerates old age. Hence it %0ais that the carefully tended trees are the first to blossom, and %0athe first to bud ; in a word, are the most precocious in every %0arespect : but all natural productions which are in any way %0aweakened are more susceptible of atmospheric influences. %0a%0aCHAP. 52. TREES WHICH BEAK VAEIOUS PEODUCTS. CEAT^GTIir. %0a%0aMany trees bears more than one production, a fact which %0awe have already mentioned^^ when speaking of the glandi- %0aferous trees. In the number of these there is the laurel, %0awhich bears its own peculiar kind of grape, and more parti- %0acularly the barren laurel,** which bears nothing else ; for %0awhich reason it is looked upon by some persons as the male %0atree. The filbert, too, bears catkins, which are hard and com- %0apact, but of no use** whatever. %0a%0a(30.) But it is the box- tree that supplies us with the great- %0aest number of products, not only its seed, but a berry also, %0aknown by the name of crataegum whUe on the north side %0a%0aSee B. XV. c. 27. The mulberry tree will live for several centuries. %0a''^ Tliis stimulates the sap, and adds to its activity : but the tree grows %0aold all the sooner, being the more speedily exhausted. %0aIn cc. 9 — 14 of the present Book. %0a" This passage is quite unintelligible; and it is with good reason that %0aFee questions whether Pliny really understood the author that he copitd %0aiVom. %0a%0aFee remarks, that Pliny does not seem to know that the catkin is an %0aassemblage of flowers, and that without it the tree would be totally barren. %0a%0a*s Pliny blunders sadly here, in copying from Theophrastus, B. iii, c. 16. %0aHe mixes up a description of the box and the Crataegus, or holm-oak, makin" %0athe latter to be a seed of the former : and he then attributes a mistletoe to %0athe box, which Theophrastus speaks of as growing on the Crataegus. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 53.] THE TEUNK8 AND BEANCHE8 OF TEEES. 391 %0a%0a%0a%0ait produces mistletoe, and on the south hyphear ; two pro- %0aducts of which I shall shortly have to speak more*" at length. %0aSometimes, indeed, this tree has all four of these products %0agrowing upon it at the same moment. %0a%0aCUAP. 53. DIFFEKEjrCES IN TEEES IN KESPECT OF THE TETTNKa %0a%0aAND BEANCHES. %0a%0aSome trees are of a simple form, and have but a single trunk %0arising from the root, together with numerous branches ; such %0aas the olive, for instance, the fig, and the vine ; others again are %0aof a shrubby nature, such as the paliurus,*'* the myrtle, and %0athe filbert ; which last, indeed, is all the better, and the %0amore abundant its fruit, the more numerous its branches. In %0aBorae trees, again, there is no trunk at all, as is the case with %0aone species of box,** and the lotus*" of the parts beyond sea. %0aSome trees are bifurcated, while there are some that branch %0aout into as many as five parts. Others, again, divide in the %0atrunk but have no branches, as in the case of the elder; Avhile %0aothers have no division in the trunk but throw out branches, %0aBuch as the pitch-tree, for instance. %0a%0aIn some trees the branches are symmetrically arranged, the %0apitch-tree and the fir, for example ; while with others they %0aare dispersed without any order or regularity, as in the robur, %0athe apple, and the pear. In the fir the branches are thrown %0aout from the trunk straight upwards, pointing to the sky, and %0anot drooping downw'ards from the sides of the trunk. It is %0aa singular thing,** but this tree wdll die if the ends of its %0abranches are cut, though, if taken ofi' altogether, no bad effect %0ais produced. If it is cut, too, below the place w^here the %0abranches were, the part of the tree w^liich is left will continue %0ato Uve ; but if, on the other hand, the top only of the tree is %0aremoved, the whole of it will die. %0a%0a*' See c, 93, where he enlarges on the varieties of the mistletoe. %0a%0a18 See B. xxiv. c. 71. . , . t, , %0a%0alie means the garden or border-box, mentioned in c. 28 of this Book. %0a%0a5" See B. xiii. c. 17 : the African lotus, probably; the Zizyphus lotus %0aof Desfontaincs. , • i t, j %0a%0a51 Tills statement is entirely incorrect. If a tree loses tne terminal bud, %0ait will "-row no higher, but it will not die if the extremities of the branches %0aare cut" Such, in" fact, is much more Kkely to happen when they are all %0acut off, from the extreme loss of juices which must naiurally ensue at the %0aseveral cicatrices united. %0a%0a%0a%0a392 %0a%0a%0a%0a■PLINI'S NATUllAL HISTORY. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0aSome trees, again, throw out branches from the roots, the %0aelm for example ; -while others are branchy at the top, the %0apine for instance, and the lotus*' or Grecian bean, the fruit of %0awhich, though wild, resembles the cherry very closely, and is %0acalled the lotus at Eome, on account of its sweetness. For %0asheltering houses these trees are more particularly esteemed, %0aas they throw out their branches to a considerable distajice, %0afrom a short trunk, thus affording a very extensive shade, and %0avery frequently encroaching upon the neighbouring mansions. %0aThere is no tree, however, the shade afforded by which is less %0along-lived than this, and when it loses its leaves in winter, %0ait affords no shelter from the sun. No tree has a more sightly %0abark, or one Avhich has greater attractions for the eye ; or %0abranches which are longer, stouter, or more numerous; in- %0adeed, one might almost look upon them as forming so many %0atrees. The bark*® of it is used for dyeing skins, and the root %0afor colouring wool. %0a%0aThe branches of the apple-tree have a peculiar conformation; %0aknots are formed which resemble the muzzles*^ of wild beasts, %0aseveral smaller ones being united to a larger. %0a%0aCHAP. 54. THE BEANCHES OF TEEES. %0a%0aSome of the branches are barren, and do not germinate; this %0atakes place either from a natural deficiency of strength, or else %0asome injury received in consequence of having been cut, and %0athe cicatrix impeding the natural functions. The same that the %0abranch is in the trees that spread out, is the eye*® in the vine, %0aand the joint in the reed. All trees are naturally the thickest %0ain the parts that are nearest the ground. The fir, the larch, the %0apalm, the cypress, and the elm, and, indeed, every tree that %0ahas but a single trunk, develope themselves in their remark- %0aable height. Among the branchy trees the cherry is some- %0atimes*^ found to yield a beam forty cubits in length by two in %0a%0a5= The Celtis australis of Linnaeus. Pliny is in error in calling this tree %0athe " Grecian bean." In B. xiii. c. 22, he erroneously calls the African %0alotus by the name of " celtis," which only belongs to the lotus of Italy ; %0athat of Africa being altogether different. %0a%0aThe bark, which is astringent, is still used in preparing skins, and a %0ablack colouring matter extracted from the root is employed in dyeing wool. %0a%0a*'' Quite an accidental resemblance, if, indeed, it ever existed. %0a" Oculus " — the bud on the trunk. %0a%0a*' This must be either a mistake or an exaggeration ; the cherry never %0abeing a very large tree. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 56.] %0a%0a%0a%0aTHE KOOTS or TBEES. %0a%0a%0a%0a393 %0a%0a%0a%0athickness throughout. Some trees divide into branches from %0athe very ground, as in the apple-tree, for example. %0a%0aCHAP. 55. (31.) THE BARK OF TREES. %0a%0aIn some trees the bark«" is thin, as in the laurel and the %0alime ; in others, again, it is thick, as in the robur ; in some it is %0asmooth, as in the apple and the fig, while in the robur and the %0apalm it is rough : in aU kinds it becomes more -wrinkled when %0athe tree is old. In some trees the bark bursts spontaneously, %0aas in the vine for instance, while in others it falls off even, as %0a•we see in the apple and the arbutus. In the cork-tree and %0athe poplar, the bark is substantial and fleshy ; in the vine and %0athe reed it is membraneous. In the cherry it is similar to %0athe coats of the papyrus, while in the vine, the lime, and the %0afir, it is composed of numerous layers. In others, again, it is %0asingle, the fig and the reed for instance. %0a%0aCHAP. 56. — THE ROOTS OF TREES. %0a%0aThere are great differences, too, in the roots of trees. In the %0afig, the robur, and the plane, they are numerous ; in the apple %0athey are short and thin, while in the fir and the larch they %0aare single ; and by this single root is the tree supported, al- %0athough we find some small fibres thrown out from it laterally. %0aThey are thick and unequal in the laurel and the olive, in %0awhich last they are branchy also ; while in the robur they %0aare solid and fleshy.*' The robur, too, throws its roots down- %0awards to a very considerable depth. Indeed, if we are to be- %0alieve Virgil,''- the sesculus has a root that descends as deep %0ainto the earth as the height to which the trunk ascends in tlie %0aair. The roots of the olive, the apple, and the cypress, creep %0aalmost upon the very surface : in some trees they run straight %0aand horizontally, as in the laurel and the olive ; while in others %0athey have a sinuous course — the fig for example. In some %0atrees the roots ai'e bristling with small filaments, as in the %0afir, and many of the forest trees ; the mountaineers cut off %0a%0aIt is evident that he is speaking of the epidermis only, and not the %0acortical layers and tlie liber. %0a%0aThe roots of trees being ligneous, " carnosse," Fee remarks, is an in- %0aiippropriate term. %0a%0aGeorg. ii. 291. %0a%0a%0a%0a394 %0a%0a%0a%0aflint's NATUBAL HISTOKT. [Book XVI. %0a%0a%0a%0athese fine filaments, and weave with them very haudsonie %0aflasks,*^ and various other articles. %0a%0aSome writers say that the roots of trees do not descend %0abelow the level to which the sun's heat is able to penetrate ; %0awhich, of course, depends upon the nature of the soil, whether %0ait happens to be thin or dense. This, however, I look upon" %0aas a mistake : and, in fact, we find it stated by some authors %0athat a fir was transplanted, the roots of which had penetrated %0aeight cubits in depth, and even then the whole of it was not %0adug up, it being torn asunder.*^ The citrus has a root that %0agoes the very deepest of all, and is of great extent ; next after %0ait come the plane, the robur, and the various glandiferous %0atrees. In some trees, the laurel for instance, the roots are %0amore tenacious of life the nearer they are to the surface: %0ahence, when the trunk withers, it is cut down, and the tree %0ashoots again with redoubled vigour. Some think that the %0ashorter the roots are, the more rapidly the tree decays ; a sup- %0aposition which is plainly contradicted by the fig, the root of %0awhich is among the very largest, while the tree becomes aged %0aat a remarkably early period. I regard also as incorrect what %0asome authors have stated, as to the roots of trees diminishing" %0awhen they are old ; for I once saw an ancient oak, uprooted %0aby a storm, the roots of which covered a jugerum of ground. %0a%0aCHAP. 57. TREES WHICH HAVE GROWX SPONTANEOUSLY FEOil THE %0a%0aGKOUND. %0a%0aIt is a not uncommon thing for trees when uprooted to re- %0aceive new strength when replanted, the earth about their roots %0aforming a sort of cicatrix*^ there. This is particularly the %0a%0a^ " Lagenas." Fee takes this to mean here vessels to hold liquids, and %0aremarks that the workers in wicker cannot attain this degree of perfection %0aat the present day. %0a%0aPliny is in error in rejecting this notion. %0a%0a«5 See B. xii. c. 5, and B. xiii. c. 29. What Pliny states of the fir, or %0aAbies pectinata, Theophrastus relates of the TrevKt], or Abies excelsa of %0aDecandolles. There is little doubt that in either case the statement is in- %0acorrect. %0a%0aOn the contrary, the roots of trees increase in size till the period of %0atheir death. %0a%0a®' By preventing the action of the air from drying the roots, and so kill- %0aing the tree. %0a%0a%0a%0aCLap. 58.] now TREES GROW SPONTAITEOTJSLT. %0a%0a%0a%0a395 %0a%0a%0a%0acase with the plane, Avhich, from the density of its branches, %0apresents a remarkabh' broad surface to the wind : when this %0ahappens, the branches are cut off, and tlie tree, thus lightened, %0ais replaced in its furrow : this, too, has also been done before %0anow with the walnut, the olive, and many others. %0a%0a(32.) AVe have many instances cited also of trees falling to %0athe ground without there being any storm or other perceptible %0acause, but merely by way of portentous omen, and then rising %0aagain of themselves. A prodigy of this nature happened to %0athe citizens of Home during tlieir wars with the Cimbri : at %0aNuceria, in the grove consecrated to Juno, an elm inclined %0ato such a degree, even after the top had been cut ofiF, as %0ato overhang the altar there, but it afterwards recovered itself %0ato such an extent as to blossom immediately : it was from that %0avery moment, too, that the majesty of the Roman people began %0ato flourish once again after it had been laid low by disaster %0aand defeat. A similar circumstance is said to have taken %0aplace also at Philippi, where a willow, which had fallen down, %0aand the top of which had been taken off, rose again ; and at %0aStagira, in the Museum^* there, where the same thing occurred %0ato a white poplar; all which events were looked upon as %0afavourable omens. But what is most wonderful of all, is the %0afact that a plane, at Antandros, resumed its original posi- %0ation even after its sides had been rough-hewn all round with %0athe adze,*^ and took root again : it was a tree fifteen cubits %0along, and four iilnae in thickness. %0a%0aCHAP. 58. — now TREES OROW SPONTAlfEOTTSLT — DIVERSITIES IN %0aTHIUU NATURK, THE SAME TREES KOT GROWING EVERYWHERE. %0a%0aThe trees which we owe to Nature are produced in three %0adifferent Avays; spontaneously, by seed sown, or by a slip %0awhich throws out a root.

At %0athe city of Panticapseum, in the vicinity of the Cimmerian Bos- %0aporus, King Mithridates and the inhabitants of the place used %0aevery possible endeavour, with a view to certain religious %0aceremonies, to cultivate the myrtle^- and the laurel : they could %0anot succeed, however, although trees abound there which re- %0aquire a hot climate, such as the pomegranate and the fig, as %0awell as apples and pears of the most approved quality.

Indeed, %0athe torrents very often bring down with them seeds, and some- %0atimes we find those of unknown kinds even floating alopg. %0aThis took place in the territory of Cyrenaica, at the period %0awhen laser was first grown there, as we shall have occasion to %0amention when we speak of the nature of the various herbs. %0aA forest, too, sprang^ up in the vicinity of the city of Cyrene, %0ajust after a shower of rain, of a dense, pitchy liature, about %0athe year of the City of Eome 430. %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 62.

The ivy is injurious* to all trees %0aand plants, and makes its way through tombs and walls ; it %0aforms a haunt much frequented by serpents, for its refreshing %0acoolness ; so that it is a matter for astonishment that there %0ashould have been such remarkable veneration for this plant. %0a%0aThe two principal kinds in the ivy, as in other plants, are %0athe male tree and the female.® The male is .said to have a %0alarger trunk than the female, and a leaf that is harder and %0amore unctuous, with a flower nearly approaching to purple : %0aindeed, the flower of both the male and female tree strongly %0aresembles the wiW-rose, were it not destitute of smell. Each %0aof these kinds of ivy is divided into three other varieties : %0athe white** ivy, the black,® and a third known as the helix." %0aThese varieties are again subdivided into others, as there is %0aone in which the fruit only is white, and another in which it %0ais only the leaf that is so. In those which have a white fruit, %0athe berry in some cases is closely packed and large, the clusters, %0awhich are known as " corymbi," being of a spherical form. %0aSo, too, with the selenitium, which has a smaller berry, and %0afewer clusters ; and the same is the case with the black ivy. %0aOne kind has a black seed, and another a seed of a safiEron" %0acolour — it is this last that poets use for their chaplets,'^ and %0athe leaves of it are not so black as in the other kinds : by some %0a%0a* Bacchus, after the alleged conquest by him of India, was said to %0ahave returned crowned with ivy, and seated in a car drawn by tigers. %0a%0a5 It is a mistake to suppose that the ivy exhausts the juices of trees. %0aIts tendrils fasten upon the cortical fissures ; and, if the tree is but small, %0aits development is apt to be retarded thereby. It is beneficial, rather %0athan destructive, to walls. %0a%0a* This plant is really monoecious or androgynous. %0a' The Rosa Eglanteria. %0a%0a* The Hedera helix of Linnaeus, or, possibly, a variety of it with varie- %0agated leaves. %0a%0a8 The Hedera arborea of C.

Some of the Greek writers even distinguish %0ain this last kind two varieties, according to the colour of the %0aberries, the erythranum" and the chrysocarpus.'* %0a%0aIt is the helix, however, that has thfe most peculiarities of %0aall, and in the appearance of the leaf more particularly, which %0aIS small, angular, and of a more elegant shape, the leaf in all %0athe other kinds being plain and simple. It differ.s, too, in the %0adistance between the joints, and in being barren more espe- %0aciall)-, as it never bears fruit. Some authors, however, think %0athat this difference exists solely in respect of age and not of %0akind, and are of opinion that what is the helix when young, %0abecomes the ordinary i\'y when old. This, however, is clearly %0aproved to be an error upon their part, for we find more varieties %0aof the helix than one, and three in particular — that of a grass- %0agreen colour, Avhich is the most abundant of all, the kind with %0a:i white leaf, and a third, which is parti-coloured, and known %0aas the Thracian helix. In that of a grass-green colour, the %0aleaves are smaller, more closely packed together, and symmetri- %0acally arranged ; while in the other kinds the features are alto- %0agether different. In the parti-coloured kind, also, one varir^ty %0ahas a smaller leaf than usual, similarly arranged, and lying %0acloser together, while in the other none of these features are %0aobserved. The leaves, too, are either greater or smaller and %0adiffer in the disposition of the spots upon them, and in the %0awhite helix some of them are whiter than others : the grass- %0agreen variety, however, is the one that grows to the greatest %0aheight. %0a%0aThe white helix is in the habit of killing trees by depriving %0athem of their juices, and increases to such a degree of density %0aas to be quite a tree itself. Its characteristics are, a very %0alarge, broad, leaf, and projecting buds, which in all the other %0akinds are bent inwards ; its clusters, too, stand out erect. %0aAlthough, too, all the ivies have arms that throw out a root, %0athose of this variety are particularly branchy and strong ; next %0ato it in strength, are those of the black ivy. %0a%0a'3 See B.

There is an ivy also which grows %0aupright, and stands without any support; being the only %0aone that does so among all the varieties, it has thence ob- %0atained the distinctive name of " cissos." The chamsecissos," %0aon the other hand, is never found except creeping upon the %0aground. %0a%0aCHAP. 63. (35.) THE S3I1LAX. %0a%0aVery similar to the ivy is a plant which first came from %0aCilicia, but is now more commonly found in Greece, and %0aknown by the name of smilax.^* It has numerous thick stalks %0acovered with joints, and thorny branches of a shrub-like form : %0athe leaf resembles that of the ivy, but is not angular, while %0afrom the foot-stalk it throws out tendrils ; the flower is white, %0aand has the smell of the lily. It bears clusters like those of %0athe wild vine and not the ivy, and of a reddish colour. The %0alarger berries contain three stones, the smaller but one only : %0athese berries are black and hard. This plant is loolced upon %0aas ill-omened, and is consequently banished from all sacred %0arites, and is allowed to form no part of chaplets ; having re- %0aceived this mournful character from the maiden Smilax, who %0aupon her love being slighted by the youth Crocus, was trans- %0aformed into this shrub. The common people, being mostly %0aignorant of this, not unfrequently take it for ivy, and pollute %0atheu" festivities with its presence ; for who, in fact, is unaware %0a%0a1^ This is the case sometimes with the black ivy, the Hedera arborea of %0aC.

In the %0afirst rank, we find the reed, equally indispensable for the %0aemergencies of war and peace, and used among the appliances-^ %0aof luxury even. The northern nations make use of reeds %0afor roofing their houses, and the stout thatch thus formed will %0alast for centuries even ; in other countries, too, they make %0ahght vaulted ceilings with them. Reeds are employed, too, %0afor writing upon paper, those of Egypt more particularly, which %0ahave a close affinity to the papyrus : the most esteemed, how- %0aever, are the reeds of Cnidos, and those which grow in Asia, %0aon the margin of the Anaitic Lake there. %0a%0aThe reed of our country is naturally of a more fungous %0anature, being formed of a spongy cartilage, which is hoUow- %0awithin, and covered by a thin, dry, woody coat without ; it %0aeasily breaks into splinters, which are remarkably sharp at the %0aedge. In other respects, it is of a thin, graceful shape, arti- %0aculated with joints, and tapering gradually towards the top, %0awhich ends in a thick, hairy tuft. This tuft is not without %0aits uses, as it is employed for filling the beds used in taverns, %0ain place of feathers ; or else, when it has assumed a more %0ahgneous consistency, it is pounded, as we see done among the %0aBelgae, and inserted between the joints of ships, to close the %0a%0a" Fke is inclined to question this ; but the breadth of the tablets may %0ahave been very small in this instance. %0a%0a^ Of course this is fabulous: though it is not impossible that the %0awriting on the tablets may sometimes have caused " a noise in the world," %0aand that hence the poets may have given rise to this story. %0a%0aPliny borrows this fabulous story from Cato, De Re Rust. c. 3. %0a^ The reeds cannot be appropriately ranked among the shrubs. %0aFor musical purposes, namely. %0aB.

By the %0aaddition of feathers they accelerate the flight of this instru- %0ament of death, and the weapon, if it breaks in the wound, %0afurnishes the combatants with a weapon afresh. With these %0amissUcs the warriors darken the very rays of the sun.'-'*' It is %0afor this reason more particularly that they desire a clear and %0aserene sky, and hold in abhorrence all windy and rainy weather, %0awhich has the effect of compelling them, in spite of them- %0aselves, to be at peace with one another. %0a%0aIf a person were carefully to enumerate the peoples of %0a-Slthiopia, Egypt, Ai'abia, India, Scythia, Bactria, and Sarmatia, %0atogether with all the numerous peoples of the East, and the %0avast realms of the Parthians, he would find that fully one-half %0aof mankind throughout the whole world live under a dominion %0aimposed by the agency of the arrow. It was their surpassing %0aexcellence in this arm that so ennobled the warriors of Crete, %0athough in this respect, as well as in all others, Italy has %0agained the mastery ; there being no reed in existence better %0aadapted for making arrows than that found in the Ehenus, a %0ariver of the territory of Bononia : filled*with a greater quan- %0atity of pith than any of the others, it is light, and easily %0acleaves the air, while at the same time it has sufficient weight %0ato resist the action of the wind ; an advantage that is not %0apossessed in an equal degree by those employed among the %0aBelgae. These advantages, however, are possessed by the %0amost approved kinds that are found in Crete, although those %0a%0a-5 " Calamus." The so-called reed of the East, used for making darts and %0aarrows, does not belong to the genus Arundo, but to those of the Bambos %0aand Nastus. %0a%0a28 Few readers of history will fail to recollect the report made to King %0aEenry V. b.y Davy Gam, before the battle of Agincomt : — "The enemy %0aare so numerous," said the messenger, " that their arrows will darken the %0asun." "We must e'en be content to fight in the dark then," was the %0awarrior's reply. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 6G.] %0a%0a%0a%0aFLUTE EEED3. %0a%0a%0a%0a405 %0a%0a%0a%0aof India are preferred ; in the opinion of some persons, how- %0aever, these last are of a totally different nature, for by adding a %0apoint to them, the natives are able to use them as lances even. %0aIndeed, we find that in India the reed grows to the thickness %0aof a tree, a fact which is proved by the specimens which are %0aeverywhere to be seen in our temples. The Indians assure %0aus that in this plant, too, there is the distinction of male and %0afemale ; the body of the male being more compact, and that %0aof the female of a larger size. In addition to this, if we can %0acredit the fact, a single compartment between the joints is %0asufficiently large to answer the purposes of a boat." These %0areeds are found more particularly on the banlis of the river %0aAcesines. %0a%0aIn everj^ variety of the reed a single root gives birth to %0anumerous stems, and if cut down, they will shoot again with %0aincreased fecundity. The root, which is naturally tenacious %0aof life, is also jointed as well as the stem. The reeds of India %0aare the only ones in which the leaves are short ; but in all the %0avarieties these leaves take their rise at the joints, and surround %0athe stem with a fine tissue about half way upwards to the %0anext joint, and then leave the stem and droop downwards. %0aThe reed, as weU as the calamus, although rounded, has two %0asides, which throw out leaves alternately from above the joints, %0ain such a way that when one springs from the right side, the %0anext issues from the joint above it on the left, and so in %0aturns. Branches, too, shoot occasionally from the stem, being %0athemselves reeds of diminutive growth. %0a%0aCHAP. 66.

One %0akind, again, is shorter, and another longer, the one thinner, %0athe other more thick. That known as the donax, throws out %0athe most shoots, and grows only in watery localities; in- %0adeed, this is a point which constitutes a very considerable %0adifference, those reeds being greatly preferred which grow %0aiu a dry soil. The archer's reed forms a peculiar species, as %0awe have already stated but that of Crete has the longest %0aintervals between the joints, and when subjected to heat is %0acapable of being rendered perfectly pliable^* at pleasure. The %0aleaves, too, constitute different varieties, not only by their %0anumber, but their colour also. The reed of Laconia is spot- %0ated,^^ and throws out a greater number of shoots at the lower %0aextremities ; being very similar in nature, it is thought, to %0athe reeds that we find growing about stagnant waters, and %0aunlike those of the rivers, in Ibeing covered with leaves of %0aconsiderable length; which, climbing upwards, embrace the %0astem to a considerable distance above the joints. There is %0aalso an obHquely-spreading reed, which does not shoot up- %0awards to any height, but spreads out like a shrub, keeping %0aclose to the earth ; this reed is much sought by animals when %0ayoung, and is known by some persons as the elegia.^* There %0ais in Italy, too, a substance found in the marsh-reeds, called %0aby the name of adarca it is only to be found issuing from the %0acuter skin, below the flossy head of the plant, and is particularly %0a%0a23 Or the pipe-reed. %0a%0a30 The tibia, or pipe, was played lengthwise, like the flageolet or %0aClarionet. %0a%0aA variety of the Arundo donax.

Characias^' %0awas the name given there to a reed of stout and compact %0aquality, while a thinner one was known as the plotias; this last %0awas to be found growing on the floating islands there, while %0athe former grew upon the banks that were covered by the %0awaters of the lake. A third kind again, which had the name %0aof "auleticon," was the same that is now know^n as the mu- %0asical pipe 2^ reed. This reed used to take nine years to grow, %0aas it was for that period that the waters of the lake were %0acontinually on the increase ; it used to be looked upon as a %0aprodigy of evil omen, if at the end of its rise its waters re- %0amained overflowing so long as a couple of years ; a thing that %0awas observed at the period of the Athenian disasters at Che- %0aronaea, and on various other occasions. This lake has the name %0aof Lebaida, at the part where the river Cephisus enters it. %0a%0aWhen this inundation has lasted so long as a year, the %0areed is found large enough to be available for the purposes of %0afowling : at this period it used to be called zeugites.*" On the %0aother hand, when the waters subsided at an earlier period, the %0areeds were known as bombycise,''' being of a more slender form. %0aIn this variety, too, the leaf of the female plant was broader %0aand whiter than that of the others, while that upon which %0athere was little or no down bore the name of the eunuch reed. %0aThe stem of this last variety was used for the manufacture of %0aconcert^- flutes. I must not here pass by in silence the mar- %0avellous care which the ancients lavished upon tliese instru- %0aments, a thing which will, in some measure, plead as an apo- %0alogy for the manufacture of them at the present day of silver %0ain preference.

At that period even the reed required consi- %0aderable seasoning to render it pliable, and to be instructed, as %0ait were, in the proper modulation of its sounds ; the mouth- %0apiece and stops ^* being naturally contracted, and so producing %0aa music better adapted to the theatrical taste of the day. %0aBut in later times, when the music became more varied, and %0aluxury began to exercise its influence upon the musical taste, %0ait became the general usage to cut the reeds before the summer %0asolstice, and to make them fit for use at the end of three %0amonths; the stops and mouth-piece being found, when the %0areeds were cut at that period, to be more open and better %0aadapted for the modifications of sound : it is in this state that %0athe reed is used for similar purposes at the present day. In %0athose times it was a very general persuasion also, that every %0apipe ought to have the tongue of its own mouth-piece cut %0afrom the same reed as itself, and that a section from the part %0anearest the root was best adapted to form the left-handed %0aflute,'*^ and from the part adjoining the top the right-handed %0aone : those reeds, too, were considered immeasurably superior, %0awhich had been washed by the waters of Cephisus itself. %0a%0aAt the present day the sacrificial pipes used by the Tuscans %0aare made of box-wood, while those employed at the games are %0amade of the lotus,*® the bones of the ass, or else silver.

He says also that the willow may be planted in its %0avicinity, than which there is no aquatic plant of more general %0autility, although the poplar may be preferred for the training %0aof the vine, and the support of the CjECuban grape ; although, %0atoo, the alder affords a more efficient protection by the hedges %0ait forms, and, planted in the very water, makes a rampart %0aalong the banks in defence of the adjoining country against %0athe violence of the rivers when they overflow ; when cut down, %0atoo, this last tree is useful for the innumerable suckers which %0ait throws out. %0a%0aCHAP. 68.

It is not, however, because the willow is %0athe only tree that produces withes ; for they may be procured %0aalso from the broom, the poplar, the elm, the blood-red cornel, %0athe birch, and the reed itself when split, or else the leaves of that %0aplant, as we know to be the case in Liguria. The vine, also, %0awill furnish them; the bramble, too, with the thorns re- %0amoved, as well as the twisted hazel. It is a very singular thing, %0athat a wood after it has been beaten and pounded should be %0afound all the stronger for making withes, but such is a striking %0apeculiarity that exists in the willow.

(38.) — THE JUICES OF TREES. %0a%0aThere is a juice in the bark of trees, which must be looked %0aupon as their blood, though it is not of a similar nature in all. %0aIn the fig it is of a milky consistency, and has the peculiar %0aproperty of curdling milk, and so forming cheese."" In the %0acherry-tree this juice is gummy, in the elm clammy, in the %0aapple viscous and fatty, while in the vine and the pear it is %0awatery. The more viscous this humour is, the more long- %0alived the tree. In a word, we find in the bodies of trees — as %0awith all other beings that are animated — skin, blood, flesli, %0asinews, veins, bones, and marrow ; the bark serving them in %0aplace of skin. It is a singular fact connected with the mul- %0aberry-tree, that when the medical men wish to extract its juice, %0aif the incision is lightly made, by a blow with a stone, and at %0athe second hour of the day in spring, the juice will flow : but %0aif, on the other hand, a w^ound is inflicted to any depth, it has %0aall the appearance of being dried iip. %0a%0aImmediately beneath the bark in most trees there is a fatty %0asubstance, which, from its colour, has obtained the name of %0aalburnum it is soft, and is the very worst part of the wood, %0a%0aLinnaeus ; the same as the Eubus tomentosus, and the Rubus corylifolius %0aof other modern botanists. %0a%0aThe Rosa canina of Linnaeus : the dog-rose or Eglantine. %0a'1 The Rubus Idoeus of botanists ; the ordinary raspberry. %0a%0aSee B. xxiv. c. 75. ggg jj^ xxiv. c. 3-5. %0a%0a'3 They are still used for dyeing, but not for staining the hair. %0aOnly as a purgative, probably. %0a%0aTliough the acid it contains would curdle milk, still its natural %0aacridity would disqualify it from being used for making cheese. %0a%0aThe white sap or inner bark ; the aubier of the French.

It is not all trees, too, that %0ahave this fat and flesh in any abundance, the same as we find %0ato be the case among the more active animals. The box, the %0acornel, and the olive have none at all, nor yet any marrow, and %0aa very small proportion, too, of blood. In the same way, too, %0athe service-tree has no bones, and the elder no flesh, Avhile %0aboth of them have marrow in the greatest abundance. Reeds, %0atoo, have hardly any flesh. %0a%0aCHAP. 73. THE VEINS AND FIBKES OF TllEES. %0a%0aIn the flesh of some trees we find both fibres'® and veins : %0athey are easily distinguished. The veins'^ are larger, while %0athe fibres are of whiter material, and are to be found in those %0awoods more particularly which are easily split. Hence it is that %0aif the ear is applied to the extremity of a beam of wood, how- %0aever long, a tap with a graver**" even upon the other end may %0abe distinctly heard, the sound penetrating by the passages %0awhich run straight through it : by these means it is that we %0aascertain whether timber runs awry, or is interrupted by knots. %0aThe tuberosities which we find on trees resemble the kernels®^ %0athat are formed in flesh : they contain neither veins nor fibres, %0abut only a kind of tough, solid flesh, rolled up in a sort of %0aball : it is these tuberosities that are the most esteemed parts**^ %0ain the citrus and the maple.

Manius Cui'ius made oath, on one occa- %0asion, that he had not touched an article of all the spoil except %0aa single oil cruet*' of beech, to use for sacrificing. "Wood %0ais always put lengthwise into the water to season, as that part %0awhich was nearest the root will sink to a greater*® depth than %0athe other. In some wood there is fibre, without veins, and merely %0aconsisting of filaments slightly knit together : wood of this %0anature is remarkably fissile. Other wood, again, is more easily %0abroken across than split, such as the wood of those trees that %0ahave no fibre, the olive and the vine, for instance : on the other %0ahand, in the fig-tree, the whole of the body consists of flesh." %0aThe holm-oak, the cornel, the robur, the cytisus, the mulberry, %0athe ebony, the lotus, and the other trees which we have %0amentioned"^ as being destitute of marrow, consist entirely of %0abone.**" All these woods are of a blackish colour, with the %0aexception of the cornel, of which glossy yellow hunting- spears %0aare made, marked with incisions for their further embellish- %0ament. In the cedar, the juniper, and the larch, the wood %0ais red. %0a%0a(39.) In Greece the female larch furnishes a wood*^ which %0ais known as aegis, and is just the colour of honey. This wood %0ahas been found to be proof against decay, and forms the pannels %0aused by painters, being never known to gape or split ; the %0aportion thus employed is that which lies nearest to the pith. In %0athe fir-tree this part is called " leuson" by the Greeks. In the %0acedar, too, the hardest part is the wood that lies nearest to the %0a%0a" And at an angle with the grain or fibre of the wood. %0a8* And at right angles.

THE TELLING OF TKEES. %0a%0aThe proper time for felling trees that are wanted for %0abarking, the round, tapering trees, for instance, that are em- %0aployed in temples and for other purposes, is at the period of %0agemmation for at other times it is quite impossible to %0adetach the bark from the rotten wood that adheres to it, while %0athe wood itself assumes a blackish hue. Squared logs, and %0awood from which the bark has been lopped, are generally cut %0am the period that intervenes between the winter solstice and %0athe prevalence of the west winds ; or else, if it is necessary %0ato anticipate that period, at the setting of Arcturus and %0abefore that of the Lyre, the very earliest period being the %0asummer solstice : the days of these respective constellations %0awill be mentioned in the appropriate placo.^^ %0a%0aIn general it is looked upon as quite suflacient to use all %0adue precaution that a tree is not rough-hewn before it has %0aborne its yearly crop. The robur, if cut in spring, is subject %0ato the attacks of wood -worm, but if cut in winter, will neither %0arot nor warp : otherwise it is very liable to bend and become %0aawry, as well as to crack ; the same is the case, too, with the %0acork-tree, even if cut down at the proper time. The state of %0athe moon,** too, is of infinite importance, and it is generally %0arecommended that trees should be cut only between the twen- %0atieth and the thirtieth days of the month. It is generally %0aagreed, however, by all, that it is the very best time for %0afelling timber, when the moon is in conjunction with the %0asun, a day which is called by some persons the interlu- %0aiiium, and by others the moon's silence. At all events, it was %0a%0a" Limo:" the alburnum previously mentioned. %0a^ This practice was formerly forbidden by the forest laws of France. %0aIn B. xviii. %0a%0aPliny borrows this superstition from Theophrastus, Ilist.

Some persons say that the %0amoon ought not only to be in conjunction, but below the ho- %0arizon as well, a thing that can only happen in the night. If the %0aconjunction should chance to fall on the very day of the winter %0asolstice, the timber, they say, that is then felled will be of ever- %0alasting duration ; the next best being the timber that is cut %0awhen the conjunction coincides with the constellations pre- %0aviously mentioned. There are some, too, who add th%3c; rising %0aof the Dog-star as a favourable time, and say that it was at %0athis period that the timber was cut which was employed in %0abuilding the Forum of Augustus. %0a%0aWood which is intended for timber ought to be cut neither %0awhen too young nor too old. Some persons, too — and the prac- %0atice is by no means without its utility — cut round ^ the tree as %0afar as the pith, and then leave the timber standing, so that all %0athe juices may be enabled to escape. Going back to ancient %0atimes, it is a remarkable fact, that in the first Punic War the %0afleet commanded by Duillius was on the water within sixty %0adays from the time the timber was cut : and, Avhat is still %0amore so, Piso relates that King Hiero had two hundred and %0atwenty ships wholly constructed in forty-five days : in the %0asecond Punic War, too, the fleet of Scipio was at sea the fortieth %0aday after the axe had been put to the tree. Such is the %0aenergy and dispatch that can be displayed on occasions of %0aemergency. %0a%0aCHAP. 75. — ^THE OPINION OF CATO ON THE FELLING OF TIMBEE. %0a%0aCato,^' a man of consummate authority in all practical mat- %0aters, expresses himself in relation to timber to the following %0aefiect : — " For making presses, employ the wood of the sappinus %0ain preference.

He then proceeds to saf %0a— " Never touch the timber, except when the moon is on the %0achange, or else at the end of the second quarter : at those %0aperiods you may either root up the -tree, or fell it as it stands. %0aThe next seven days after the full moon are the best of all for %0agrubbing up a tree. Ee particularly careful, too, not to rough- %0ahew timber, or, indeed, to cut or touch it, unless it is perfectly %0adry; and by no means while it is covered with frost or dew," %0aThe Emperor Tiberius used also to observe the changes of %0athe moon for cutting his hair.' M. Varro- has recommended %0athat the hair should be cut at full moon only, if we would %0aavoid baldness. %0a%0aCHAP. 76. THE SIZE OF TREES : THE NATURE OF WOOD : THE %0a%0aSAPPINUS. %0a%0aFrom the larch, and still more the fir, after it has been %0acut, a liquid^ flows for a considerable period : these are tlie %0aloftiest and straightest of all the trees. The fir is pre- %0aferred for making the masts and sailyards of ships, on account %0aof its comparative liglitness. It is a common feature with %0athese trees, in common with the pine, to have four rows of %0aveins running along the wood^ or else two, or sometimes only %0aone. The heart * of these trees is peculiarly well adapted for %0ajoiners' work, and the best wood of all is that which has four %0alayers of veins, it being softer than the rest : men of expe- %0arience in these matters can instantly form a judgment of the %0aquality from the bark.

The juniper, too, has the same' virtues as the cedar; %0ain Spain it grows to a very considerable size, in the territory %0aof tlie Vaccaei more particularly : the heart of this tree, too, %0ais universally more firm and solid than cedar even. A general %0afault in all wood is that known as cross-grain, which is formed %0ahy contortions of the knots and veins." In the wood of some %0atrees there are to be found knurs,'* like those in marble ; these %0aknurs are remarkably hard, and offer a resistance like that of %0aa nail, to the great injury of the saw : in some cases, also, they %0aare formed accidentally, from eillier a stone, or tlie branch of %0aanother tree lodging there, and being absorbed in the body of %0athe tree. , %0a%0aIn the Forum at Megara there long stood a wild olive upon %0awhich warriors who had distinguished themselves by their %0a%0a^ Witli reference to the fir, namely. %0a%0a7 B. iii. c. 5. « B. iv. c. 3. %0a%0a5 An additional proof, perhaps, that the cedar of the ancients ia only %0aone of the junipers, and that, as Fee says, they were not acquainted with %0athe real cedar. %0a%0a1" B. iii. c. 4. %0a%0a11 " Spiras."

Upon it, however, de- %0apended the fate of the city ; for it had been announced bvau %0aoracle, that Avhcn a tree there should bring forth arms, the' fall %0aof the city would be close at hand : and such, in fact, was tlie %0aresult, when the tree Avas cut down and greaves and helmets %0awere found within the wood." It is said that stones found %0aunder these circumstances have the property of ijreventiug %0aabortion. %0a%0a(40.) It is generally thought that the largest" tree that has %0aever been seen, was the one tliat Avas exhibited at Home, by %0aTiberius Caesar, as an object of curiositj-, upon the bridge of %0atlie Naumachia previously mentioned.!^ It had been brought %0athither along with other timber, and was preserved till the con- %0astruction of the amphitheatre of the Emperor Nero:''"' it was a %0alog of larch, one hundred and twenty feet long, and of an uniform %0athickness of a couple of feet. From this fact -we can form an %0aestimate of the original height of the tree ; indeed, measured %0afrom top to bottom it must have been originally of a length %0athat is almost incredible. In our own time, too, in the porticos %0aof the Septa,'' there was a log which had been left there by M. %0aAgrippa, as being equally an object of curiosity, having been %0afound too large to be used in the building of the vote office %0athere : it was twenty feet shorter than the one previously men- %0ationed, and a foot-and-a-half in thickness. There was a fir, %0atoo, that was particularly admired, when it formed the mast %0aof the ship, which brouglit from Egypt, by order of the Em- %0aperor Caius," the obelisk*' that was erected in the Yaticanian %0aCircus, with the four blocks of stone intended for its base.

It took the arms of four men to %0aspan the girth of this tree, and we not unfrequently hear of %0athe price of masts for such purposes, as being eighty thousand %0asesterces or more : rafts, too, of this wood are sometimes put %0atogether, the value of which is forty thousand. In Egypt and %0aSyria, it is said, the kings, for want of fir, used to employ %0acedtu-^- for building their ships : the largest cedar that we find %0amentioned is said to have come from Cyprus, where it was cut %0ato form the mast of a galley of eleven tiers of oars that be- %0alonged to Demetrius : it was one hundred and thirty feet in %0alength, and took three men to span its girth. The pirates of %0aGermanj' navigate their seas in vessels formed of a single tree %0ahollowed^^ out : some of these will hold as many as thirty %0amen. %0a%0aOf all woods, the most compact, and consequently the hea- %0aviest, are the ebonj^ and the box, both of them of a slender %0amake. Neither of these woods will float in water, nor, indeed, %0aAvill that of the cork tree, if the bark is removed ; the same is %0athe case, too, with the wood of the larch. Of the other woods, %0athe driest is that of the tree known at Rome as the lotus,^* %0aand next, that of the robur, when the white sap has been re- %0amoved. The wood of the robur is dark, and that of the cy- %0atisus'^* still more so, approaching, in fact, the nearest of all to %0athe colour of ebony; though there are not wanting writers who %0aassert that the wood of the Syrian terebinth is darker.^® An %0aartist of the name of Thericles is highly spoken of for his skill %0ain turning goblets from the wood of the terebinth : and, indeed, %0atliat fact is a proof of the goodness of the wood.

Its colour is imitated remarkably well with %0athe walnut and the wild pear, which have its peculiar tint %0aimparted to them by being boiled in colouring liquid. The %0awood of all the trees of which we have here made mention is %0afirm and compact. Next after them comes the cornel, although %0ait can hardly bo looked upon as timber, in consequence of its %0aremarkable slimness ; the wood of it, in fact, is used for hardlj- %0aany other purpose than the spokes of wheels, or else for mak- %0aing wedges for splitting wood, and pins or bolts, which have %0aall the hardness of those of iron. Besides these, there are %0athfe holm-oak, the wild and the cultivated olive, the chesnut, %0athe yoke-elin, and the poplar. This last is mottled simi- %0alarly to the maple, and would be used for joiners' work if wood %0acould be good for anything when the branches are so often %0alopped : tliat acting upon the tree as a sort of castration, and %0adepriving it of its strength. In addition to these facts, most of %0athese trees, but the robur more particularly, are so extremely %0ahard, that it is quite impossible to bore the wood till it has %0abeen soaked in water ; and even then, a nail once driven lioiiie %0acannot be drawn out again. On the other hand, a nail has no**^ %0ahold in cedar. The wood of the lime is the softest of all, and, %0aas it would appear, the hottest by nature ; a proof of this, they %0asay, is the fact that it will turn the edge of the adze sooner %0athan any other wood.-' In the number, also, of the trees that %0aare hot by nature, are the mulberry, the laurel, the ivy, and %0aall those woods from which fire is kindled by attrition. %0a%0aCHAP. 77. — METHODS OF OBTAINING FIKE FROM WOOD. %0a%0aThis is a method'*^ which has been employed by the outposts %0aof armies, and by shepherds, on occasions when there has not %0abeen a stone at hand to strike fire with. Two pieces of wood %0aare rubbed briskly togcthei', and the friction soon sets them on %0afire ; which is caught on dry and inflammable substances, fun- %0aguses and leaves being found to ignite the most readily. There %0ais nothing superior to the wood of the ivy for rubbing against, %0a%0a^ This is not the case ; a nail has a firm hold in all resinous woods. %0aThis is evidently a puerile absurdity : but it is borrowed from Theo- %0aphrastus, Hist.

A species of wild %0avine/' too— not the same as the labrusca — which climbs up %0aother trees like the ivy, is highly approved of. The coldest " %0awoods of all are those of the aquatic trees ; but they are tlic %0amost flexible also, and for that reason the best adapted for the %0aconstruction of bucklers. On an incision being made in them, %0athey will contract immediately, and so close up their wounds, %0aat the same time rendering it more difficult for the iron to pe- %0anetrate : in the number of these woods are the f.g, the willow, %0athe lime, the birch, the elder, and both varieties of the poplar. %0a%0aThe lightest of all these woods, and consequently the most %0auseful, are the fig and the willow. They are all of them em- %0aployed, however, in the manufacture of baskets and other %0autensils of wicker-work; while, at the same time, they pos- %0asess a degree of whiteness and hardness which render them %0avery well adapted for carving. The plane has considerable %0aflexibility, but it is moist and slimy like the alder. The elm, %0atoo, the ash, the mulberry, and the cherry, are flexible, but of %0aa drier nature ; the wood, however, is more weighty. The %0aelm is the best of all for retaining its natural toughness, and %0ahence it is more particularly employed for socket beams for %0ahinges, and cases for the pannelling of doors, being proof %0aagainst warping. It is requisite, however, that the beam to %0areceive the hinge should be inverted when set up, the top of %0athe tree answering to the lower hinge, the root to the upper. %0aThe wood of the palm and the cork-tree is soft, while that of %0athe apple and the pear is compact. Such, however, is not the %0acase with the maple, its wood being brittle, as, in fact, all %0aveined woods are. In every kind of tree, the varieties in the %0aAvood are still more augmented by the wild trees and the males. %0aThe wood, too, of the barren tree is more solid than that of the %0ai'ruit-bearing ones, except in those species in which the male %0atrees bear fruit, the cypress and the cornel, for instance. %0a%0aCHAP. 78.

HISTORICAL FACTS CONNFCTED WXTII THE DURABILITY %0a%0aOF AVOOD. %0a%0aOf all the woods, the ebony, the cypress, and the cedar are %0aconsidered to be the most durable, a good proof of which is to %0abe seen in the timber of which the Temple of Diana at Ephesiis %0ais built : it being now four hundred years since it was erected, %0aat the joint expense of the whole of Asia f'^ and, what is a well- %0aknown fact, the roof is wholly constructed of planks of cedar. %0aAs to the statue of the goddess, there is some doubt of what %0awood it is made ; all the writers say that it is ebony, with the %0aexception of Muciunus, who was three times consul, one of %0athe very latest among the writers that have seen it ; he de- %0aclares that it is made of the wood of the vine, and that it has %0anever been changed all the seven times tliat the temple has %0abeen rebuilt. He says, too, that it was Endagus who made %0achoice of this wood, and even goes so far as to mention the %0aartist's name, a thing that really surprises me very mucli, see- %0aing that he attributes to it an antiquity that dates before the %0atimes of Father Liber, and of Minerva even. He states, also, %0athat, by the aid of numerous apertures, it is soaked witli %0anard, in order that the moist nature of that drug may preserve %0athe wood and keep the seams^^ close together : I am rather %0asurprised, however, that there should be any seams in tlie %0astatue, considering the very moderate size it is. He informs %0aus, also, that the doors are made of cypress, and that the %0awood, which has now lasted very nearly four hundred years, %0ahas all the appearance of new.^^ It is worthy of remark, too, %0athat the wood of these doors, after the pieces had been glued %0atogether, was left to season four years before they were put %0a%0a32 As\a Minor, namely.

[Book XVI. %0a%0alip : cypress was made choice of from the circumstance that it %0ais the only kind of wood that maintains its polish to all future %0atime. %0a%0aAnd have we not the statue of Vejovis/* also, made of cypress, %0asf.ill preserved in the Capitol, where it was consecrated in the %0ayear of the City 661 The Temple of Apollo, too, at Utica, %0ais equally celebrated : there we may see beams of cedar still %0ain existence, and in just the same condition in which they %0awere when erected at the first building of that city, eleveu %0aliundred and seventy-eight years ago. At Saguntum, too, in %0aSpain, there is a temple of Diana, which was brought thither %0aby the original founders of the place, from the island of Zu- %0acynthus, in the year 200 before the taking of Troy, Jiocchus %0asays — It is preserved beneath the town, they say. Hannibal, %0abeing induced thereto by feelings of religious veneration, %0aspared this temple, and its beams, made of juniper, are still %0ain existence at this very day. But the most memorable in- %0astance of all is that of the temple which was dedicated to the %0asame goddess at Aulis, several ages before the Trojan War : of %0awhat wood, however, it was originally built is a fact that has %0abeen long lost in oblivion. Speaking in general terms, we %0amay say that those woods are of the greatest durability which %0aare the most odoriferous.^^ %0a%0aNext to those woods of which we have just spoken, that of %0athe mulberry is held in the highest degree of esteem, and it %0awill even turn black when old. There are some trees, again, %0athat are more durable than others, when employed for certain %0apurposes. The wood of the elm lasts the best in the open air, %0athat of the robur when buried in the ground, and that of the %0afpiercus when exposed to the action of water : indeed, the %0awood of this last, if employed in works above ground, is apt %0ato split and warp. The wood of the larch thrives best in the %0amidst of moisture ; the same is the case, too, with that of the %0ablack alder. The wood of the robur spoils by exposure to the %0aaction of sea- water. The beech and the walnut are far from %0adisapproved of for constructions under water, and, in fact, %0athese are the principal woods, too, that are used for works %0a%0a33 One of the earliest appellations, probably, of Jupiter amon? the Ro- %0amans.

On the other hand, the alder, when driven into the %0aground in marshy localities, is of everlasting duration, and %0aable to support the very heaviest weights. Tlie wood of the %0acherry is strong, while those of the elm and the ash are pli- %0aable, though apt to warp : these last will still retain their %0aflexibility, and be less liable to warp, if the wood is left to %0astand and dry upon the trunk after the pith has been cut %0auround.^** It is said that the larch, when used for sea-going %0aships, is liable to the attacks^^ of the teredo, as, in fact, all the %0awoods are, with the exception of the wild and cultivated olive. %0aIt is a fact, too, that there are some woods that are more liable %0ato spoil in the sea, and others in the ground. %0a%0aCHAP. 80. (41.) VAEIETIES OF THE TEREDO. %0a%0aThere are four kinds of insects that attack wood. The %0ateredo has a head remarkably large in proportion to the other %0apart of the body, and gnaws away the wood with its teeth : %0aits attacks, however, are confined solely to the sea, and it is %0agenerally thought that this is the only insect that is pro[)erly %0aso called. The wood- worm that prevails on the land is known %0aas the " tinea," while those which resemble a gnat in appear- %0aance are called " thripes." The fourth kiud of wood-worm %0abelongs to the maggot class ; some of them being engendered %0aby the corruption of the juices of the wood itself, and others %0abeing produced, just as in the trees, by the worm known as %0athe cerastes.^" AVhen this worm has eaten away enough of %0athe wood to enable it to turn round, it gives birth to another. %0aThe generation of these insects is prevented, however, by the %0abitterness that exists in some woods, the cypress, and the %0ahardness of others, the box, for instance. %0a%0aIt is said, too, that the fir, if barked about the time of bud- %0ading, and at the period of the moon already mentioned," wiU %0anever spoil in water.

(42.) — THE WOODS USED IN BUILDINR. %0a%0a"We have in Italy some woods that are apt to split of %0athemselves : to prevent this, architects recommend that they %0ashould be first seasoned in manure" and then dried, in order %0ato render them proof against the action of the atmosphere. %0aThe woods of the fir and larch are well adapted, even when %0aused transversely, for the support of heavy burdens ; while the %0arobur and the olive are apt to bend and give way under a %0aweight. The wood of the poplar and the palm are also strong, %0abut this last will bend, though in a manner different from %0athe others ; for, while in all other instances the wood bends %0adownwards, in the palm it bends in the contrary direction," %0aand forms an arch. The woods of the pine and the cypress %0aare proof against decay and all attacks of wood-worm. The %0awalnut is easily warped, but we sometimes see beams even %0amade of it. It gives warning, however, before it breaks, by a %0aloud cracking noise ; such was the case at Antandros, at the %0apublic baths there — the bathers took the alarm upon hearing %0athe beams crack, and made their escape. The pine, the pitch- %0atree, and the alder are employed for making hollow pipes for %0athe conveyance of water, and when buried in the earth will %0alast for many years. If, however, they are not well covered %0aover, they will very soon rot ; and the resistance they offer to %0adecay will increase in a most surprising degree if the outer %0asurface as well is left in contact with the water. %0a%0aThere is nothing very surprising in this, as most woods are preserved %0ahetter when completely immersed in water, than when exposed to the va- %0ariations of the atmosphere. %0a%0a*3 He borrows this fable from Theophrastus, B. v. c. 5. %0a%0aThis process, Fee says, would he attended with no success. %0a*5 It is not quite clear whether he intends this observation to apply to the %0apoplar and the palm, or to the last only. It is true, however, in neither %0acase, and is contrary, as Fee observes, to all physical laws. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 83.] %0a%0a%0a%0aWOODS UNITED WfTII GLUE. %0a%0a%0a%0a427 %0a%0a%0a%0aCHAP. 82. — CAEPENTEES' WOODS. %0a%0aThe wood of the fir is strongest in a vortical position : it %0ais remarkably well adapted for the pannels of doors, and all %0akinds of in-door joiners' work, whether in the Grecian, the %0aCampanian, or the Sicilian style. The shavings of this wood %0awhen briskly planed, always curl up in circles like the tendrils %0aof the vine. This wood, too, unites particularly well with %0aglue : it is used in this state for making vehicles, and is found %0ato split sooner in the solid parts than in a place where the %0apieces have been glued together. %0a%0aCHAP. 83. (43.) WOODS UNITED WITH GLtTE, %0a%0aGlue, too, plays one of the principal parts in all veneering %0aand works of marqueterie. For this purpose, the workmen %0ausually employ wood with a threaded vein, to which they give %0athe name of " ferulea," from its resemblance to the grain of %0athe giant fennel," this part of the wood being preferred from %0aits being dotted and wavy. In every variety there are some %0a■woods to be found that will not take the glue, and which re- %0afuse to unite either with wood of the same kind or of any %0aother; the wood of the robur for example. Indeed, it is %0amostly the case that substances will not unite unless they are %0aof a similar nature ; a stone, for instance, cannot be made to %0aadhere to wood. The wood of the service-tree, the yoke-elm, %0athe box, and, in a less degree, the lime, have a particular %0aaversion to uniting with the cornel. All the yieldiiig woods %0awhich we have already spoken** of as flexible readily adapt %0athemselves to every kind of work ; and in addition to them, %0athe mulberry and the wild fig. Those which are moderately %0amoist are easily sawn and cut, but dry woods are apt to give %0away beyond the part that is touched by the saw ; while, on %0athe other hand, the green woods, with the exception of the %0arobur and the box, offer a more obstinate resistance, filling the %0aintervals between the teeth of the saw with sawdust, and %0arendering its edge uniform and inert; it is for this reason %0athat the teeth are often made to project right and left in turns, %0a%0a« The resistance that woods offer when placed vertically is in the same %0aratio as that presented hy tliem when employed horizontally.

The Gallic variety is so supple, that it is %0aemployed in the construction of vehicles even, Tlie elm %0awould rival the trunk of the vine^ for some purposes, were %0ait not that its weight is so much against it. %0a%0aCHAP. 84. — Vi?NEERlNG. %0a%0aThe wood, too, of the beech is easily worked, although it is %0abrittle and soft. Cut into thin layers of veneer, it is very %0aflexible, but is only used for the construction of boxes and %0adesks. The wood, too, of the holm-oak is cut into veneers %0aof remarkable thinness, the colour of which is far from un- %0asightly ; but it_ is more particularly where it is exposed to %0afriction that this wood is valued, as being one to be depended %0aupon ; in the axle-trees of wheels, for instance ; for which the %0aash is also employed, on account of its pliancy, the holm-oak %0afor its hardness, and the elm, for the union in it of both %0athose qualities. There are also various workman's tools made %0aof wood, which, though but small, are still remarkably useful : %0ain this respect, it is said that the best materials for making %0aauger handles are the wild olive, the box, the holm-oak, the %0aelra, and the ash. Of the same woods also mallets are made ; %0athe larger ones, however, are made of the pine and the holm- %0aoak. These woods, too, have a greater degree of strength and %0ahardness if cut in season than when hewn prematurely ; indeed, %0ait has been known for hinge-jambs, made of olive, a wood of %0aremarkable hardness, after having remained a considerable %0atime on the spot, to put out buds*' like a growing plant. Cato" %0arecommends levers to be made of holly, laurel, or elm ; and %0aHyginus speaks highly of the yoke-elm, the holm-oak, and %0athe cerrus, for the handles of agricultural implements. %0a%0aThe best woods for cutting into layers, and employing as a %0a%0a" See c. 24. %0a%0a50 Fee thinks, from the context, that the meaning is, that the vine wns %0aemployed m the construction of chariots ; it depends entirely on the nunt- %0atuation adopted. ^ %0a%0a=1 This could only have happened in the first year that they wore so %0ae°>ployed. 52 De lie Rust. c. 31. %0a%0a%0a%0aChap. 85.] THE AGE OE TREES. 429 %0a%0aveneer for covering others, are the citrus, the terebinth, the %0adifferent varieties ot tlie maple, the box, the palm,^' the holly %0ahe holm-oak, the root of the older, and the poplar. The ald'e^ %0aluniishes also, as already stated," a kind of tuberosity, which %0a,s cut in 0 layers like those of the citrus and the maple. In %0aaU the other trees the tuberosities are of no value whatever. %0aIt 18 the central part of trees that is most variegated, and the %0anearer we approach to tlie root the smaller are the spots and %0athe more wavy. It was in this appearance that originated %0athat requirement of luxury which displays itself in covering %0aone tree vvith another, and bestowing upon the more common %0awoods a bark of higher price. In order to make a single %0atree sell many times over, laminae of veneer have been de- %0avised ; but that was not thought sufficient— the horns of ani- %0amals must next be stained of different colours, and their teeth %0acut into sections, in order to decorate wood with ivorj^ and, %0aat a later period, to veneer it all over. Then, after all this, man %0amust go and seek his materials in the sea as well ! For this %0apurpose he has learned to cut tortoise-shell into sections ; and %0aof late, in the reign of Nero, there was a monstrous invention %0adevised of destroying its natural appearance by paint, and %0amaking it sell at a still higher price by a successful imitation %0aof wood. %0a%0aIt is in this way that the value of our couches is so greatly %0aenhanced ; it is in this way, too, that they bid the rich lustre of %0athe terebinth to be outdone, a mock citrus to be made that %0ashall be more valuable than the real one, and the grain of the %0amaple to be feigned. At one time luxury was not content %0awith wood ; at the present day it sets us on buying tortoise- %0ashell in the guise of wood. %0a%0aCHAP. 85. (44.) THE AGE OF TKEES.

The lotus tree, which is %0aknown as the Capillata, is still older than this, though it is %0auncertain what is its age; it received that name from the %0acircumstance of the Vestal Virgins suspending locks of their %0ahair*' from it, « %0a%0aCHAP. 86. — TREES AS OLD AS THE CITY. %0a%0aThere is another lotus in the Vulcanal,'''' which Romulus %0aerected with the tenth part of the spoil taken from the enemy: %0aaccording to Massurius, it is generally considered to be as old %0aas the City.

The %0asame is the case, too, with the vine,''" and more particularly %0athe more fruitful varieties. Grajcinus informs us that vines %0ahave lasted so long as sixty years. It appears, also, that the %0aaquatic trees die the soonest. The laurel,'" the apple, and %0athe pomegranate age rapidly, it is true, but then they throw %0aout fresh shoots at the root.

In the vicinity %0aof this grove there is a holm-oak, likewise of very considerable %0acelebrity, the trunk of which is no less" than thirty-four feet %0ain circumference ; giving birth to ten other trees of remarkable %0asize, it forms of itself a whole forest. %0a%0aCHAP. 92.

There are %0acertain vegetable productions which cannot be propagated in %0athe ground, and which grow nowhere but on trees ; having no %0adomicile of their own, they live upon others ; such, for instance, %0ais the case with the mistletoe, and a herb that grovrs in Syria, %0aand is known as the " cadytas."'^ This last entwines around %0anot only trees, but brambles even ; in the neighbourhood of %0aTempe, too, in Tliessaly, there is found a plant which is called %0a"polj-podion the dolichos'** is found also, and wild thj-me.'^ %0aAfter the wild olive has been pruned there springs up a jjlant %0athat is known as " phaulias while one that grows upon the %0a%0a" To its great detriment, probably. %0a%0aFee says that no holm-oak is ever known to attain this size. %0a" See c. 62. %0a%0a" Sprcngcl says that this is the parasitic plant, which he calls Cassyta %0afiliformis.

THREE VAKIETIES OF MISTLETOE. THE KATUKE OF %0a%0aMISTLETOE AND SIMILAR PLANTS. %0a%0aThere are three vai'ieties of the mistletoe.'" That which %0agrows upon the fir and the larch has the name of*' stclis in %0aEuboea ; and there is the hyphear®' of Arcadia. It grows %0aalso upon the quercus,^^ the robur, the holm-oak, the wild %0aplum, and the terebinth, but upon no other tree.'^ It is most %0aplentiful of all upon the quercus, and is then known as %0a" adasphear." In all the trees, with the exception of the holm- %0aoak and the quercus, there is a considerable difference in its %0asmell and pungency, and the leaf of one kind has a disagree- %0aable odour ; both varieties, however, are sticky and bitter. %0aThe hj-phear is the best for fattening*^ cattle with ; it begins, %0ahowever, by purging off all defects, after which it fattens all %0asuch animals as have been able to withstand the purging. It %0ais generally said, however, that those animals which have any %0aradical malady in the intestines cannot withstand its drastic %0aeffects. This method of treatment is generally adopted in the %0asummer for a period of forty days. %0a%0aBesides the above, there is yet another difference*'' in the %0amistletoe ; that which grows upon the trees which lose their %0aleaves, loses its leaves as well ; while, on the other hand, that %0awhich grows upon evergreens always retains its leaves. In %0awhatever way the seed may have been sown, it will never %0acome to anj'thing, unless it has been first swallowed^^ and %0a%0a~^ See B. xxvii. c. 66. Tlie Calcitrapa stellata of Lamarck.

It never exceeds a single cubit in height, %0aand is always green and branchy. The male^ plant is fruit- %0aful, the female barren ; sometimes, indeed, the male even %0abears no berry. %0a%0aCHAP. 94. THE METHOD OF MAKING BIRDLIME. %0a%0aBirdlime is made of the berries of the mistletoe, which are %0agathered at harvest, and while in an unripe state ; for if the %0arainy season comes on, though they increase in size, the viscous %0ajuice is apt to lose its virtues. They are then dried,''' and %0awhen brought to a state of perfect aridity, are first pounded, %0aand then put in water, in which they are left to rot for twelve %0adays ; this being, in fact, the only thing that finds improve- %0ament in decay. After this, they are again beaten in running %0awater with a mallet, and after losing the outer coat there is %0aonly the viscous inner pulp remaiuing. This substance is %0abirdlime ; and after it has been thinned by the addition of %0aAvalnut oil, it is found particularly useful for catching birds, %0ait being quite sufficient if they only touch it with the wings. %0a%0aCHAP. 95. niSTOKlCAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE MISTLETOE. %0a%0aUpon this occasion we must not omit to mention the ad- %0amiration that is lavished upon this plant by the Gauls. The %0aDruids— for that is the name they give to their magicians^"— %0aheld nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree %0athat bears it, supposing always that tree to be the robur.^^ %0aOf itself the robur is selected by them to form whole groves, %0aand they perform none of their religious rites without em- %0aploying branches of it ; so much so, that it is very probable %0athat the priests themselves may have received their name %0a%0aare more likely to adhere to the bark of trees, and so find a nidus for ger- %0amination. „ , , . f 1 I 4. %0a%0aThe exact opposite is the case, the female being the fruittui plant. %0a9» The method used in Italy for making bhd-linie is very similar at the %0a%0apresent day. .'\'^^'''S°!\^ ^ %0a%0a»' DecandoUe was of opinion, that the mistletoe ot the Druids was not %0au viscum, but the Loranthus Europxus, which is much more commonly %0a%0af'uuud on oaks. ^ %0a%0ar F 2 %0a%0a%0a%0a436 %0a%0a%0a%0aFlint's natiual history. %0a%0a%0a%0a[Book XVl. %0a%0a%0a%0afrom the Greek name"'- for that tree. In fact, it is the notion %0awith them that everything that grows on it has been sent %0aimmediately from heaven, and that the mistletoe upon it is a %0aproof that the tree has been selected by God himself as an %0aobject of his especial favour. %0a%0aThe mistletoe, however, is but rarely found upon the robur; %0aand when found, is gathered with rites replete with religious %0aawe. This is done more particularly on the fifth day of the %0amoon, the day which is the beginning of their months and %0a3-ears, as also of their ages, which, with them, are but thirty %0ayears. This day they select because the moon, though not %0ayet in the middle of her course, has already considerable %0a])0wer and influence ; and they call her by a name which sig- %0anifies, in their language, the all-healing.^^ Having made all %0adue preparation for the sacrifice and a banquet beneath the %0atrees, they bring thither two white bulls, the horns of which %0aare bound then for the first time. Clad in a white robe the %0apriest ascends the tree, and cuts the mistletoe with a golden %0asickle, which is received by others in a white cloak.''* They %0athen immolate the victims, offering up their prayers that God %0awill render this gift of his propitious to those to whom he has %0aso granted it. It is the belief with them that the mistletoe, %0ataken in drink, will impart fecundity to all animals that are %0abarren, and that it is an antidote for all poisons.^" Such are %0athe religious feelings which we find entertained towards trifling %0aobjects among nearly all nations. %0a%0aSummary. — Remarkable facts, narratives, and observations, %0aone thousand one hundred and thirty-five. %0a%0aRoMAif ATTTHOES QiTOTEB. — M.

More recently, again, they were employed %0a%3c in the sacred games and at the present day they are be- %0a%3c stowed on such occasions, not upon the victor, indeed, but %0a%3c upon his country, which receives, it is proclaimed, this crown at %0a%3c his hands.-^ Hence arose the usage of conferring wreaths upon %0a%3c warriors when about to enjoy a triumph, for them to conse- %0a%3c crate in the temples : after which it became the custom to %0a%3c present them at our games.

Kigorous %0a%3c laws were, however, enacted, to maintain the lofty glories of %0a%3c this wreath, by which it was placed upon an equality even %0a%3c with the supreme honours of the wreath that is given by %0a%3c Greece in presence of Jove^ himself, and to receive which the %0a%3c exulting city of the victor is wont to break** a passage through %0a%3c its very walls. These laws are to the effect that the life of a %0a%3c fellow-citizen must be preserved, and an enemy slain ; that %0a%3c the spot where this takes place must have been held by the %0a%3c enemy that same day ; that the person saved shall admit the %0a%3c fact, other witnesses being of no use at all ; and that the person %0a%3c saved shall have been a Roman citizen. %0a%3c %0a%3c To preserve an ally merely, even though it should be the %0a%3c life of a king that is so saved, confers no right to this high re- %0a%3c ward, nor is the honour at all increased, even if it is the %0a%3c Eoman general that has been thus preserved, it being the in- %0a%3c tention of the framers of the law that it should be the status %0a%3c of the citizen that is everything. When a man has received %0a%3c this wreath, it is his privilege to wear it for the rest of his %0a%3c life. When he makes his appearance at the celebration of the %0a%3c games, it is customary for the Senate even to rise from their %0a%3c seats, and he has the right of taking his seat next to the senators. %0a%3c Exemption, too, from all civic duties is conferred upon him as %0a%3c well as his father and his father's father. Siccius Dentatus, as we %0a%3c have already mentioned on an appropriate occasion, received %0a%3c fourteen civic crowns, and Manlius Capitolinus^'' six,^* one, %0a%3c among the rest, for having saved the life of his general, Ser- %0a%3c vilius. Scipio Africanus declined to accept the civic crown %0a%3c for having saved the life of his father at the battle of Trebia. %0a%3c Times these, right worthy of our everlasting admiration, %0a%3c which accorded honour alone as the reward of exploits so %0a%3c i^igtty, and wliich, while other crowns were recommended by %0a%3c being made of gold, disdained to set a price upon the safety of %0a%3c a citizen, and loudly proclaimed thereby that it is unrighteous %0a%3c to save the life of a man for motives of lucre. %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 At the Olympic games celebrated in honour of Jupiter.

THIRTEEN VAEIETIES OF THE ACORN. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is a well-known fact that acorns at this very day con- %0a%3c stitute the wealth of many nations, and that, too, even amid %0a%3c these times of peace. Sometimes, also, when there is a scarcity %0a%3c of corn they are dried and ground, the meal being employed %0a%3c for making a kind of bread. Even to this very day, in the %0a%3c provinces of Spain,*" we find the acorn introduced at table in %0a%3c the second course : it is thought to be sweeter when roasted %0a%3c in the ashes. By the law of the Twelve Tables, there is a %0a%3c j)rovision made that it shall be lawful for a man to gather his %0a%3c acorns when they have fallen upon the land of another. %0a%3c %0a%3c The varieties of the glandiferous trees are numerous, and %0a%3c they are found to difter in fruit, locality, sex, and taste ; the %0a%3c acorn of the beech having one shape, that of the quercus %0a%3c another, and that, again, of the holm-oak another. The various %0a%3c species also, among themselves, offer a considerable number of %0a%3c varieties. In addition to this, some of these trees are of a %0a%3c wild nature, while the fruits of others are of a less acrid %0a%3c flavour, owing to a more careful cultivation. Then, too, there %0a%3c is a difference between the varieties which grow on the moun- %0a%3c tains and those of the plains; the males differ from the %0a%3c females, and there are considerable modifications in the flavour %0a%3c of their fruit. That of the beech ''^ is the sweetest of all ; so %0a%3c much so, that, according to Cornelius Alexander, the people of %0a%3c the city of Chios, when besieged, supported themselves wholly %0a%3c on mast. The different varieties cannot possiblj' be distin- %0a%3c guished by their respective names, which vary according to %0a%3c %0a%3c " Glandes." Under this name, for which wc do not appear to have any %0a%3c English equivalent, were included, as already mentioned, not only tlie %0a%3c acorn of the oak, but the nut or mast of the ficech, and probably most of %0a%3c the hard or kernel fruits. In the present instance Pliny probably alludes %0a%3c only to the fruit of the oak and the beech. Acorns are but little used as %0a%3c an article of food in these days. Roasted, they have been proposed as a %0a%3c substitute for coffee. %0a%3c %0a%3c The acorn of the Quercus ballota of Linnneus is probably meant, which %0a%3c is still much used in the province of Salamanca, and forms an ajrreeable %0a%3c article of food. This acorn, Fee says, contains a considerable proportion %0a%3c of saccharine matter, and is better roasted in the ashes than boiled in water. %0a%3c It is not, however, used as a dessert, as in the time of the Romans. These %0a%3c acorns are sold at market in Andalusia in the month of October. %0a%3c %0a%3c " So far as it goes, the kernel of the mast or beech-nut is not unpa- %0a%3c latable ; but in the English beech it is very diminutive. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 346 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's natural histobt. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c their several localities.

(6.) THE BEECH. %0a%3c %0a%3c The acorn of the beech is similar in appearance to a kernel, %0a%3c enclosed in a shell of triangular shape. The leaf is thin and %0a%3c one of the very lightest, is similar in appearance to that of the %0a%3c poplar, and turns yellow with remarkable rapidity. From the %0a%3c middle of the leaf, and upon the upper side of it, there mostly %0a%3c shoots a little green berry, with a pointed top.^' The beech is %0a%3c particularly agreeable to rats and mice ; and hence it is, that %0a%3c where this tree abounds, those creatures are sure to be plen- %0a%3c tiful also. The leaves are also very fattening for dormice, %0a%3c and good for thrushes too. Almost all trees bear an average %0a%3c crop but once in two years ; this is the case with the beech %0a%3c more particularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 8. THE OTHER ACOENS — WOOD TOIL FtTEL. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other trees that bear acorns, properly so called, are the %0a%3c %0a%3c The word " quercus " is frequently used as a general name for the %0a%3c oak ; but throughout the present Hook it is most employed as meaning a %0a%3c distinct variety of the oak, one of the larger kinds, i ke says, and answering %0a%3c to the Quercus racemosa of Lamarck, the Quercus robur of Linnaeus, and %0a%3c the Rouvre of the French. %0a%3c %0a%3c " This also has been much employed as a general name for the oak ; but %0a%3c here, and in other parts of this Book, it is applied to one variety. Fee %0a%3c thinks that it answers to the Quercus sessiliflora of Smith, sometimes also %0a%3c called " rouvre" by the French. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Quercus aesculus of Linnaeus. It is not improbable that this oak %0a%3c is a different tree from the "iEsculus " of Horace and Virgil, which was %0a%3c perhaps either a walnut, or a variety of the beech. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^5 It has been suggested that this is the same with the Quercus cerrus of %0a%3c Linnajus, and the Quercus crinita of Lamarck, the gland of which is placed %0a%3c in a prickly cupule. It is rarely found in France, but is often to be met %0a%3c vrith. in Piedmont and the Apennines. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The Fagus silvatica of Lamarck. Its Latin name, "fagus," is supposed %0a%3c to have been derived from the Greek ^aya>, " to eat." An oil is extracted %0a%3c from the acorns or nuts, that is much used in some parts of France. %0a%3c %0a%3c « He speaks probably of one of the galls which are found attached to %0a%3c the leaves of the forest trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 8.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE OTnEU AC0BN3. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 347 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c robur, the oesculus, the cemis, the holm-oak/« and the cork- %0a%3c tree it is contained in a rivelled calyx, which embraces %0a%3c more or less of it, according to the several varieties. The %0a%3c leaves of these trees, those of the holm-oak excepted, are %0a%3c weighty, pulpy, long, and jagged at the edges, and they do %0a%3c not turn yellow before they fall, as with the beech : they are %0a%3c also longer or shorter, as the case may be. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two kinds ^* of holm-oak : one of them, which %0a%3c belongs to Italy, has a leaf not very unlike that of the olive ; %0a%3c Bome of the Greeks give it the name of " milax,"*' and in our %0a%3c provinces it is known as the aquifolia. The acorn of these %0a%3c two kinds is shorter and more slender than in the others : %0a%3c Homer'- calls it " acylos," and by that name distinguishes it %0a%3c from the ordinary acorn : it is generally said that the male %0a%3c tree of the holm-oak bears no fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best acorn, and the very largest, is that which grows %0a%3c upon the quercus, and the next to it is the fruit of the jescu- %0a%3c lus : that of the robur, again, is diminutive, and the fruit of %0a%3c the cerrus has a meagre, wretched look, being enclosed in a %0a%3c calyx covered with prickles, like the outer coat of the ches- %0a%3c nut. With reference to the acorn of the quercils, that which %0a%3c grows upon the female tree*^ is sweeter and more tender, %0a%3c while that of the male is more solid and compact. The acorn, %0a%3c however, of the latifolia'* is the most esteemed, an oak so %0a%3c %0a%3c " " Ilex." Fee thinks that the varieties known as the Prinos and the %0a%3c Ballota were often confounded by the ancients with the " ilex " or " holm- %0a%3c oak." Tiiis tree, he says, bears no resemblance to the ordinary oak, except %0a%3c in the blossoms and the fruit. It is the Ilex of Linnaeus, the " yeuse," or %0a%3c "green oak," of the French. %0a%3c %0a%3c " The Quercus suber of Linnaeus ; it is found more particularly in the %0a%3c department of the Landes in France. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ As Fee remarks, Pliny is clearly in error here; one kind being the %0a%3c veritable ilex or holm oak, the other, the aquifolium or holly, quite a dif- %0a%3c fcrcnt tree %0a%3c %0a%3c " The smilax or milax wasareal holm oak,but the aquifolia was the holly. %0a%3c %0a%3c '2 Od. xi. 242. Fee remarks that the berry of the holly has no resem- %0a%3c blance to the acorn whatever, and he says that this statement of Pliny al- %0a%3c most leads him to think that the second variety here mentioned by him was %0a%3c not in reality the holly, but a variety of the quercus. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Fee observes that, properly speaking, there is no sex in the oak, the %0a%3c individuals being neither male nor female. The Flora Damca however, as %0a%3c he observes, gives the name of " Quercus fcemina" to the Quercus racemosa %0a%3c of Lamarck. - , ^ -i- %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Or "broad-leaved" oak; one of the varieties of the Quercus sessih- %0a%3c %0a%3c flora of Smith— i%25r.

The acorns %0a%3c differ also among themselves in size, and the comparative %0a%3c fineness of the outer shell ; as also in the circumstance that %0a%3c some have beneath the shell a rough coat of a rusty colour, %0a%3c while in others a white flesh immediately presents itself. %0a%3c Those, too, are more particularly esteemed, the two extre- %0a%3c mities of the nut of which, taken lengthwise, are as hard as a %0a%3c stone : and it is considered preferable that this peculiarity %0a%3c should present itself rather in the shell than in the flesh : in %0a%3c cither case, however, it only exists in the fruit of the male tree. %0a%3c In some kinds, again, the acorn is oval, in others round ; %0a%3c while in others it is of a more pointed form. The colour, too, %0a%3c varies considerably, according as it is blacker or whiter ; this %0a%3c last being held in the highest esteem. The extremities of the %0a%3c acorn are bitter, but the flesh in the middle of it is sweet;" %0a%3c another difference, too, consists in the comparative length or %0a%3c shortness of the stalk. %0a%3c %0a%3c As for the trees themselves, the one that bears the acorn of %0a%3c largest size is known as the "hemeris;"^ a small tree with %0a%3c a thick bushy foliage all ai'ound it, and often hollowed at the %0a%3c place where the branch is joined to the trunk. The quercus %0a%3c has a stronger wood, and less susceptible of decay : this also is %0a%3c a very branchy tree, but is much taller than the last, while %0a%3c the trunk is considerably thicker. The jegilops," however, is %0a%3c the highest of them all, and is much attached to wild, unculti- %0a%3c vated spots. Next to this in height is the lati folia, but its %0a%3c wood is far from being so useful either for building purposes %0a%3c or for charcoal. When rough-hewn it is very apt to spoil, %0a%3c hence it is that it is generally used in an unhewn state. Ah %0a%3c charcoal, it is considered only economical in smelting copper ; %0a%3c for the moment the workman ceases to blow, the fire dies out, %0a%3c and hence it requires to be repeatedly rekindled ; while at the %0a%3c same time it gives out great quantities of sparks. The best %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This statement is contrary to general experience in modern times, %0a%3c tlie flavour of tlic acorn being uniformly acrid and bitter throughout. It %0a%3c is not impossible, however, that the flavour may have been more palatable %0a%3c in ancient times. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ A variety of the common oak, the Quercus raccmosa of Lamarck ; %0a%3c Sprengel takes it to be the Quercus ballota of Desfontaines.

In %0a%3c addition to this, it is very frequently struck by lightning, %0a%3c although it is not so remarkably lofty in height: for this %0a%3c reason it is not considered lawful to employ its wood for the %0a%3c purposes of sacrifice. It is but rarely that it bears any acorns, %0a%3c and when it does they are bitter : no animal will touch them, %0a%3c with the sole exception of swine, and not even they, if they %0a%3c can get any other food. An additional reason also for its ex- %0a%3c clusion from all religious ceremonials, is the circumstance %0a%3c that the fire is very apt to go out in the middle of the %0a%3c sacrifice when the wood of it is used for fuel. %0a%3c %0a%3c The acorn of the beech, when given to swine,^ makes them %0a%3c brisk and lively, and renders the flesh tender for cooking, and %0a%3c light and easy of digestion ; while, on the other hand, that of %0a%3c the holm oak has the effect of making them thin, pallid, %0a%3c meagre, and lumpish. The acorn of the quercus is of a broad %0a%3c shape, and is the heaviest as well as the sweetest of them %0a%3c all. According to Nigidius, the acorn of the cerrus occupies %0a%3c the next rank to this, and, indeed, there is no acorn that %0a%3c renders the flesh of swine more firm, though at the same time %0a%3c it is apt to impart a certain degree of hardness. The same %0a%3c author assures us also, that the acorn of the holm oak is a %0a%3c trjang diet for swine, unless it is given in very small qaan- %0a%3c %0a%3c *8 Pliny's account of making charcoal is derived from Theophrnstiis, %0a%3c B. iii. c. 10.

The Greek %0a%3c name signifies the " sea cork tree." %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ The statement here given as to the effect of beech-mast on swine, is %0a%3c destitute, Fee remarks, of all foundation.

THE GALL-KUT. %0a%3c %0a%3c All" the glandiferous trees produce the gall-nut as well : %0a%3c they only bear acorns, however, in alternate years. The gall- %0a%3c nut of the hemeris"'^ is considered the choicest of all, and the %0a%3c best adapted for the preparation of leather : that of the lati- %0a%3c folia closely resembles it, but is somewhat lighter, and not by %0a%3c any means so highly approved. This last tree produces the %0a%3c black gall-nut also — for there are two varieties of it — this last %0a%3c being deemed preferable for dyeing wool. %0a%3c %0a%3c (7.) The gall-nut begins to grow just as the sun is leaving %0a%3c the sign of Gemini,^^ and always bursts forth in its entirety in a %0a%3c single night.** The white variety grows, too, in a single day, but %0a%3c if the heat happens to overtake it, it shrinks immediately, and %0a%3c never arrives at its proper size, which is about that of a bean. %0a%3c The black gall-nut w411 remain green for a longer period, and %0a%3c sometimes attains the size of an apple*^ even. The best kind is %0a%3c that which comes from Commagene,^* and the most inferior %0a%3c are those produced by the robur : it may easily be tested by %0a%3c means of certain holes in it which admit of the passage of the %0a%3c light." %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 10. — OTHEE PRODUCTIONS ON THESE TllEES BESIDES THE %0a%3c ACOEN. %0a%3c %0a%3c The rohxir, in addition to its fruit, has a great number of %0a%3c other productions : it bears** the tw^o varieties of the gall-nut, %0a%3c %0a%3c ^1 This assertion is perhaps too general ; gall-nuts are produced in very %0a%3c small quantities by the holm-oak. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^2 A variety of the Quercus racemosa, which produces the green gall- %0a%3c nut of Aleppo, considered in modern, as in ancient, times the choicest in %0a%3c quality. %0a%3c %0a%3c Theophrastus says the end of June, %0a%3c fi* Its growth, in I'eality, is not so rapid as this. %0a%3c ^5 Such a thing is never seen at the present day. %0a%3c ^ In Syria.

Little %0a%3c balls'" also are found growing on the robur, not unlike nuts in %0a%3c appearance, and containing within them a kind of soft wool, %0a%3c which is used for burning in lamps ; for it will keep burning %0a%3c without oil, which is the case also with the black gall-nut. %0a%3c It bears another kind, too, of little ball, covered with hair," but %0a%3c used for no purpose: in spring, however, this contains a juice like %0a%3c honey. In the hollows formed by the union of the trunk and %0a%3c branches of this tree there are found also small round balls,'^ %0a%3c which adhere bodily to the bark, and not by means of a stalk : %0a%3c at the point of junction they are white, but the rest of the %0a%3c body is spotted all over with black : inside they are of a scarlet %0a%3c colour, but on opening them they are found to be empty, and %0a%3c are of a bitter taste. %0a%3c %0a%3c Sometimes, too, the robur bears a kind of pumico,^^ as well %0a%3c as little balls, which are formed of the leaves rolled up ; upon %0a%3c the veins of the leaves, too, there are watery pustules, of a %0a%3c whitish hue, and transparent while they are soft ; in these a %0a%3c kind of gnat'* is produced, and they come to maturity just in %0a%3c the same way that the ordinaiy gall-nut does. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP, 11.

In spring the %0a%3c ball opens throughout, and it fiially drops when the leaves %0a%3c are beginning to grow. %0a%3c %0a%3c Such is the multiplicity of the products borne by the robur %0a%3c in addition to its acorns ; and not only these, but mushrooms'' %0a%3c as well, of better or worse quality, the most recent stimulants %0a%3c that have been discovered for the appetite ; these last are found %0a%3c growing about its roots.

The robur produces mistletoe"* also, %0a%3c and, if we may believe Hesiod," honey as well : indeed, it is %0a%3c a well-known lkct,that a honey*^-like dew falling from heaven, as %0a%3c we have already mentioned,**' deposits itself upon the leaves of %0a%3c this tree in preference to those of any other.

The pine yields the %0a%3c least resin of them all : in the pine nut, indeed, of which we %0a%3c have previously spoken,^ it is sometimes to be found, but %0a%3c hardly in sufficient quantities to warrant us in reckoning tlie %0a%3c pine among the resinous trees. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 17. — THE PINASTEK. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pinaster is nothing else but a wild pine : it rises to a %0a%3c surprising height, and throws out branches from the middle, %0a%3c just as the pine does from the top. This tree yields a more %0a%3c copious supply of resin than the pine : the mode in Avhich this %0a%3c is done we shall set forth on a future occasion. It grows %0a%3c also in flat countries. Many people think that this is the %0a%3c same tree that grows along the shores of Italy, and is known %0a%3c as the " tibulus ;" ^' but this last is slender, and more com- %0a%3c pact than the pine ; it is likewise free from knots, and hence %0a%3c is used in the construction of light gallies they are both almost %0a%3c entirely destitute of resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 18. — THE PITCn-TKEE : THE FIE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pitch-tree loves the mountain heights and cold loca- %0a%3c lities. This is a funereal tree, and, as an emblem of death, is %0a%3c placed before the door of the deceased, and is left to grow in %0a%3c the vicinity of the funeral pile.

THE LARCH : THE TOECH-TIIEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fifth kind of resinous tree has the same localities, and %0a%3c is very similar in appearance; it is known as the larch." The %0a%3c wood of this tree is far more valuable, being unimpaired by %0a%3c time, and proof against all decay ; it is of a reddish colour, %0a%3c and of an acrid smell, llesin flows from this wood in still %0a%3c greater quantities ; it is of the colour of honey, more viscous %0a%3c than the other varieties, and never turns hard. %0a%3c %0a%3c as incense for the rites of the Eonian church : while sometimes it is pur- %0a%3c posely employed, as being cheaper. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* A great street in Capua, which consisted entirely of the shops of sellers %0a%3c of unguents and perfumes. %0a%3c %0a%3c " It has the same pyramidal form as the pitch-tree.

The wood, too, of this tree is more particu- %0a%3c larly employed for kindling fires and giving torch-light in %0a%3c religious ceremonials. Of tliis tree it is the male only that %0a%3c bears what is known to the Greeks by the name of " syce,"^' %0a%3c remarkable for its extremely powerful odour. When the %0a%3c larch" is changed into the torch-tree, it is a proof that it is in %0a%3c a diseased state. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wood of all these trees, when set fire to, gives out im- %0a%3c moderate volumes of sooty sraoke,*^and sputters every now and %0a%3c then with a sudden crackling noise, while it sends out red- %0a%3c hot charcoal to a considerable distance — with the sole exception %0a%3c of that of the larch, which will neither burn^ nor char, nor, in %0a%3c fact, suffer any more from the action of fi.re than a stone. All %0a%3c these trees are evergreens, and are not easily^* distinguished %0a%3c by the foliage, even by those who are best acquainted with %0a%3c them, so nearly related are they to one another. The pitch- %0a%3c tree, however, is not so high as the larch ; which, again, is %0a%3c stouter, and has a smoother back, with a more velvety leaf, %0a%3c more unctuous to the touch, thicker, and. more soft and flexi- %0a%3c ble.-" The pitch-tree, again, has a leaf more sparsely scattered %0a%3c and drier ; it is thinner also, and of a colder nature, rougher all %0a%3c over in appearance, and covered with a resinous deposit : the %0a%3c wood of this tree is most like that of the fir. The larch, when %0a%3c %0a%3c ''o It is doubtful if the tacda, or torch-tree, has been identified. Some %0a%3c take it to be the Pinus mugho of MHIlt, the torch-pine of tbe French ; %0a%3c others, again, suggest that it is the same as the Pinus cembro of the bo- %0a%3c tanists. %0a%3c %0a%3c So called from its resemblance to a fig. Fee says that there is little %0a%3c doubt that this pretended fruit was merely a resinous secretion, which %0a%3c hardens and assumes the form of a fig. %0a%3c %0a%3c *2 He somewhat mistranslates a passage of Theophrastus here, who, %0a%3c without transforming the larch into another tree, says that it is a sign of %0a%3c disease in the larch, when its secretions are augmented to such a degree %0a%3c that it seems to turn itself into resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lamp-black of commerce is made from the soot of the pine. %0a%3c %0a%3c This statement, though supported by that of Vitruvius, V,. ii. c. 9, is %0a%3c quite erroneous. The wood of the larch gives out more heat than that of %0a%3c the fir, and produces more live coal in proportion. %0a%3c ^ This, Fee remarks, is the fact. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ This description is inexact, and we should have some difficulty in %0a%3c recognizing here the larch as known to us. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 19.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c TUE LAUCII. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 359 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c the roots are once burnt, will not throw out fresh Bhoots, %0a%3c which the pitch-tree will do, as was found to be the case in the %0a%3c island of Lesbos, after the Pyrrhajan grove had been burnt %0a%3c there. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the same species too, the variety of sex" is found to con- %0a%3c stitute a considerable difference : the male is the shorter tree, %0a%3c and has a harder wood ; while the female is taller, and bears a %0a%3c leaf more unctuous to the feel, smooth and free from all %0a%3c rigidity. The wood of the male tree is hard and awry, and %0a%3c consequently not so well suited for carpenters' work ; while %0a%3c that of the female is softer, as may be very easily perceived on %0a%3c the application of the axe, a test, in fact, which, in every %0a%3c variety, immediately shows us which trees are males ; the axe %0a%3c in such case meeting with a greater resistance, falling with %0a%3c a louder noise, and being withdrawn from the wood with con- %0a%3c siderably greater diflSculty : the wood of the male tree is more %0a%3c parched too, and the root is of a blacker hue. In the vicinity of %0a%3c Mount Ida, in Troas, the circumstance whether the tree grows %0a%3c in the mountain districts or on the sea-shoro, makes another %0a%3c considerable difference. In Macedonia and Arcadia, and in tho %0a%3c neighbourhood of Elis, the names of the several varieties have %0a%3c been totally altered, and it has not been agreed by authors %0a%3c which name ought to be given to each : we have, therefore, %0a%3c contented ourselves with employing the Eoman denominations %0a%3c solely. %0a%3c %0a%3c The fir is the largest of them all, the female being the taller %0a%3c of the two ; the wood7 too, is softer and more easily worked. %0a%3c This tree is of a rounder form than the otliers, and its leaves %0a%3c are closely packed and feathered, so as not to admit of the %0a%3c passage of rain ; the appearance, too, of the tree is altogether %0a%3c more cheerful. From the branches of these different varieties, %0a%3c with the sole exception of the larch,'^^ ^i^ere hang numbers of %0a%3c scaly nuts of compact shape, like so many catkins.

All that he relates relative to the differences between the %0a%3c male and female pine is consequently false. He has, however, m this in- %0a%3c stance, only perpetuated an erroneous opinion of 1 heoplirastus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 This 4 an erroneous statement. Tlie larch has its cone, as well as %0a%3c the rest. It is possible, however, that its small size may have caused it tu %0a%3c be overlooked by Pliny. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 360 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c PLI>r'3 NATURAL HISTOUr. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c riJook XVI. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c not the case with those on the female tree. In the pitch-tree, %0a%3c again, these kernels, which arc very small and black, occupy %0a%3c the whole of the catkin, which is smaller and more slender %0a%3c than in the other varieties ; hence it is that the Greeks call %0a%3c this tree by the name of phthirophoron.-" In this tree, too, the %0a%3c nuts on the male are more compressed, and less moist with %0a%3c resin. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 20. — THE YEW. %0a%3c %0a%3c Not to omit any one of them, the yew is similar to these %0a%3c otlier trees in general appearance. It is of a colour, however, %0a%3c but slightly apiiroaching to green, and of a slender i'orm; of %0a%3c sombre and ominous aspect, and quite destitute of juice : it is %0a%3c the only one, too, among them all, that bears a berry. In the %0a%3c male tree the fruit is injurious ; indeed, in Spain more particu- %0a%3c larly, the berries contain a deadly poison.^^ It is an ascertained %0a%3c fact that travellers' vessels,^- made in Gaul of this wood, for the %0a%3c purpose of holding wine, have caused the death of those who %0a%3c used them. Sextius says, that in Greece this tree is known by %0a%3c the name of " smilax," and that in Arcadia it is possessed of so %0a%3c active a poison, that those who sleep beneath it, or even take %0a%3c food'*^ there, are sure to meet their death from it. There are %0a%3c authors, also, who assert that the poisons which we call at %0a%3c the present day " toxica," and in which arrows are dipped, %0a%3c were formerly called taxica,^^ from this tree. It has been %0a%3c discovered, also, that those poisonous qualities are quite neu- %0a%3c tralized by driving a copper nail into the wood of the tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c 29 Or " louse-bearing."

The first steam that exudes %0a%3c flows in the form of water into a reservoir made for its recep- %0a%3c tion : in Syria this substance is known as "cedrium;"^* and %0a%3c it possesses such remarkable strength, that in Egypt the bodies %0a%3c of the dead, after being steeped in it, are preserved from all %0a%3c corruption.^' %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 22. METHODS BY WHICH THICK PITCH IS PREPARED. %0a%3c %0a%3c The liquid that follows is of a thicker consistency, and con- %0a%3c stitutes pitch, properly so called. This liquid, thrown agtiin %0a%3c into a brazen cauldron, and mixed with vinegar, becomes still^" %0a%3c thicker, and when left to coagulate, receives the name of %0a%3c " Bruttian" " pitch. It is used, however, only for pitching the %0a%3c insidcs of dolia** and other vessels, it differing from the other %0a%3c kinds in being more viscous, of a redder colour, and moro %0a%3c unctuous than is usually the case. All these varieties of pitch %0a%3c are prepared from the pitch-tree, by putting red-hot stones, %0a%3c with the resinous wood, in troughs made of strong oak ; or %0a%3c if these troughs are not attainable, by piling up billets of the %0a%3c %0a%3c " Numerous varictios of the conifcrre supplj' us with t;ir, and Pliny i'^ %0a%3c in error in deriving it solely from the torch-tree, the I'inus musho of Liii- %0a%3c nseus. 2« See B. xxiv. c. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c '1 It is still obtained in a similar way. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee remarks, that Pliny is in error here ; this red, watery fluid formed %0a%3c in the extraction of tars, being quite a diflcrent thing from " cedrium," the %0a%3c alkitran or kitran of the Arabs ; which is not iminobably made Irom a %0a%3c cedar, or perhaps the J uniperus Phoenieea, called "Cedrus" by the two %0a%3c Bauhins and Tournefort. He says that it is not likely that the i.gvptiaus %0a%3c would use this red substance for the purpose of preservmg the dead, chargi il %0a%3c ns it is with cmpyrcumatic oil, and destitute of all properties peculiar to %0a%3c rosins. 39 See B. xxi. c. 3, and B. xxiv. c. 23. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is impracticable; neither vinegar, wine, nor water, will mingle %0a%3c with pitch.

The same resin, if boiled gently %0a%3c with water, and then strained off, becomes viscous, and assumes %0a%3c a red colour; it is then known as "distilled" pitch:" for %0a%3c making this, the refuse portions of the resin and the bark of %0a%3c the tree arc generally selected. %0a%3c %0a%3c Another method is adopted for the manufacture of that used %0a%3c as crapula." Raw flower of resin is taken, direct from the %0a%3c tree, with a plentiful sprinkling of small, thin chips of the %0a%3c w^ood. These are then pounded'^ down and passed through a %0a%3c sieve, after which they are steeped in water, which is heated %0a%3c till it comes to a boil.

This composi- %0a%3c tion is found much more efficient for all those purposes in %0a%3c which pitch and resin are employed, in consequence of the %0a%3c superior hardness which has been imparted to it by the sea- %0a%3c salt. %0a%3c %0a%3c The pitch-tree is opened on the side that faces the sun, %0a%3c not by means of an incision, but of a wound made by the re- %0a%3c moval of the bark : this opening being generally two feet in %0a%3c width and one cubit from the ground, at the very least. The %0a%3c body of the tree, too, is not spared in this instance, as in others, %0a%3c for even the very chips from off it are considered as having %0a%3c their use ; those, however, from tlie lower part of the tree are %0a%3c looked upon as the best, the wood of the higher parts giving %0a%3c the resin a bitter" taste. In a short time all the resinojis %0a%3c juices of the entire tree come to a point of confluence in the %0a%3c wound so inflicted : the same process is adopted also with the %0a%3c torch-tree. When the liquid ceases to flow, the tree is opened %0a%3c in a similar manner in some other part, and then, again, else- %0a%3c where : after which the whole tree is cut down, and the pith** %0a%3c of it is used for burning.*' %0a%3c %0a%3c So, too, in Syria they take the bark from off the terebinth ; %0a%3c and, indeed, in those parts they do not spare even the root or %0a%3c branches, although in general the resin obtained from those %0a%3c parts is held in disesteem.

The best pitch** %0a%3c everj-wherc is that obtained from trees planted on sunny spots %0a%3c with a north-east aspect ; while that Avhich is produced from %0a%3c more shaded localities has a disagreeable look and a repulsive %0a%3c odour. Pitch, too, that is produced amid the cold of winter is %0a%3c of inferior quality, being in smaller quantity, too, and compara- %0a%3c tively colourless. Some persons are of opinion that in moun- %0a%3c tainous localities this liquid is produced in the greatest abun- %0a%3c dance, and that it is of superior colour and of a sweeter taste %0a%3c and has a finer smell so long as it remains in a state of resin ; %0a%3c but that when, on the other hand, it is subjected to boiling, it %0a%3c yields a smaller quantity of pitch, because so much of it goes" %0a%3c off in a serous shape. They say that the resinous trees, too, %0a%3c that grow on mountains are thinner than those that are found %0a%3c on plains, but that they are apt, both of them, to be unpro- %0a%3c ductive in clear, diy weather. %0a%3c %0a%3c , Some trees, too, afford a flow of resinous juice the year after %0a%3c the incision is made, some, again, in the second year, and %0a%3c others in the third. The wound so made is filled with resin, %0a%3c but not with bark, or by the cicatrization of the outer coat ; %0a%3c for the bark in this tree never unites. Among these varie- %0a%3c ties some authors have made the sappium" to constitute a %0a%3c peculiar kind, because it is produced from the seed of a kin- %0a%3c dred variety, as we have already stated when speaking of the %0a%3c nuts** of trees ; and they have given the name of txda.^ to %0a%3c the lower parts of the tree ; although in reality this tree is no- %0a%3c thing else but a pitch-tree, Avhich by careful cultivation has %0a%3c lost some small portion of its wild character.

This is a tall, tapering tree, with a %0a%3c feather-hke leaf: it has been greatly ennobled by the enco- %0a%3c miums of Homer, and the fact that it formed the spear of %0a%3c Acliillcs the wood of it is employed for numerous purposes. %0a%3c Tlic ash which grows upon Mount Ida, in Troas, is so ex- %0a%3c tremely like the cedar,™ that, when the bark is removed, it %0a%3c ■will deceive a purchaser. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks have distinguished two varieties of this tree, %0a%3c the one long and without knots, the other short, with a harder %0a%3c wood, of a darker colour, and a leaf like that of the laurel. %0a%3c In Macedonia they give the name of "bumelia"'' to an ash %0a%3c of remarkably large size, with a wood of extreme flexibility. %0a%3c Some authors have divided this tree into several varieties, ac- %0a%3c cording to the localities which it inhabits, and say that the %0a%3c ash of the plains has a spotted wood, while that of the moun- %0a%3c tain ash is more compact. Some Greek writers have stated %0a%3c that the leaf of the ash is poisonous" to beasts of burden, but %0a%3c harmless to all the animals that ruminate." The leaves of %0a%3c this tree in Italy, however, are not injurious to beasts of bur- %0a%3c den even ; so far from it, in fact, that nothing has been found %0a%3c to act as so good a specific for the bites of serpents'" as to drink %0a%3c the juice extracted from the leaves, and to apply them to the %0a%3c wounds. So great, too, are the virtues of this tree, that no %0a%3c serpent will ever lie in the shadow thrown by it, either in the %0a%3c %0a%3c ® He (Iocs not speak in tliis place of the "ornus" or "mountain ash;" %0a%3c nor, as Fee obst i ves, does be mention the use of the bark of the ash as a %0a%3c febrifuge, or of its leaves as a purgative. This ash is the Fraxinus ex- %0a%3c celsior of Dccandolles. «9 II. xxiv. 277. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny makes a mistake here, in copying from Theopbrastus, who says %0a%3c that it is the yew that boars so strong a resemblance to the cedar. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Or "buU's-ash." This variety does not seem to have been identified. %0a%3c %0a%3c " This statement results from his misinterpretation of the language of %0a%3c Tbeophrastus, who is really speaking of the yew, which Pliny mistakes %0a%3c tor tlic ash. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Miller asserts that, if given to cows, this leaf will impart a bad flavour %0a%3c to the milk ; a statement which, Fee says, is quite incorrect. %0a%3c %0a%3c '* A merely fanciful notion, without apparently the slightest foundation : %0a%3c the same, too, may be said of tlie alleged antipathy of the serpent to the %0a%3c beech-tree, which is neither venomous nor odoriferous. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 366 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c plint's katubal history.

By a wonderful provision %0a%3c of Nature, the ash has been made to blossom before the ser- %0a%3c pents leave their holes, and the fall of its leaf does not take %0a%3c place till after they have retired for the winter. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 25. (14.) — TWO VAEIETIES OF THE LINDEN-TEEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the linden-tree the male" and the female are totally dif- %0a%3c ferent. In the male the wood is hard and knotty, of a redder %0a%3c hue, and Avith a stronger smell ; the bark, too, is thicker, and, %0a%3c when taken off, has no flexibility. The male bears neither %0a%3c seed nor blossom as the female docs, the trunk of which is %0a%3c thicker, and the wood white and of excellent quality. It is a %0a%3c singular" thing, but no animal will touch the fruit of this %0a%3c tree, although the juice of the leaves and the bark is sweet. %0a%3c Between the bark and the wood there are a number of thin %0a%3c coats, formed by the union of numerous fine membranes ; of %0a%3c these they make those bands'* which are known to us as "tUiae." %0a%3c The finer membranes are called "philyra3," and are rendered %0a%3c famous by the honourable mention that the ancients have %0a%3c made of them as ribbons for wreaths'® and garlands. The %0a%3c %0a%3c ''^ This story of Pliny has been corroborated by M. de Verone, and as %0a%3c strongly contradicted by Camerarius and Charras : with M. Fee, then, we %0a%3c must leave it to the reader to judge which is the most likely to be speaking %0a%3c the truth. It is not improbable that Pliny may have been imposed upon, %0a%3c as his credulity would not at all times preclude him from being duped. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is no such distinction in the linden or lime, as the flowers are %0a%3c hermaphroditical. They are niurely two varieties : the male of Pliny being %0a%3c tlie Tilia microphylla of Dccandolles, and a variety of the Tilia Europaa %0a%3c of Linnaeus ; and the female being the Tilia platyphyllos, another variety %0a%3c of the Tilia Europaea of Linnteus. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Not at all singular, Fee says, the fruit being dry and insipid. %0a%3c %0a%3c " In France these cords are still made, and are used for well-ropes, %0a%3c wheat-sheafs, &c.

(15.) TEN VABIETIES Of THE MAPLE. %0a%3c %0a%3c The naaple, which is pretty nearly of the sarae«= size as the %0a%3c lime, is inferior to the citrus*' only for the beauty of its wood %0a%3c when employed for cabinet work, and the exquisite finish it %0a%3c admits of. There are numerous varieties'** of this tree ; the %0a%3c light maple, remarkable for the extreme whiteness of its wood, %0a%3c is known as the " Gallic" maple in Italy beyond the Padus, %0a%3c being a native of the countries beyond tlie Alps. Another %0a%3c kind is covered with w^avy spots running in all directions. %0a%3c In consequence of its superior beauty it has received its name,^ %0a%3c from its strong resemblance to the marks which are seen in %0a%3c the tail of the peacock ; the finest kinds are those which grow %0a%3c in Istria and Ilhaetia. An inferior sort of maple is known as %0a%3c "crassivenium."'*' %0a%3c %0a%3c The Greeks distinguish the varieties according to their re- %0a%3c spective localities. The maple of the plains,'*" they say, is %0a%3c white, and not wavy; they give it the name of " glinon." %0a%3c On the other hand, the mountain maple,**" they say, is of a %0a%3c more variegated appearance, and harder, the wood of the male %0a%3c tree being more particularly so, and the best adapted for spc- %0a%3c %0a%3c " Teredo." If he moans under this name to inchide the tinea as %0a%3c well, the assertion is far too general, us this wood is eaten away by insects, %0a%3c though more slowly than the majority of the non-resinous woods. It is %0a%3c tiDnietimes perforated quite through by the larva of the byrrhus, our death- %0a%3c watch. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' This is incorrect. It attains a very considerable height, and some- %0a%3c times an enormous size. Tlie trunk is known to grow to as much as forty %0a%3c or fifty feet in circumforeneo. %0a%3c %0a%3c The maple is much less in size than what the lime or linden really is. %0a%3c ^-'i See B. xiii. c. 29. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says there are but five varieties of the maple known in France. %0a%3c He doubts wliether tlie common maple, the Acer canipestrc of Linnaeus, %0a%3c was known to the ancients. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee identifies it with the Acer pseudo-platanus of LinniBus, the Acer %0a%3c montanum candidum of C.

A third kind, ngain, accord- %0a%3c ing to the Greeks, is the zj-gia,*^ with a red wood, which is %0a%3c aisily split, and a pale, rough bark. Other authors, however, %0a%3c prefer to make of this last a peculiar species, and give it in %0a%3c Latin the name of " carpinus." %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 27.

These are both of them tuberosities of tliis tree, the %0a%3c bruscum presenting veins more violently contorted, while those %0a%3c of the molluscum are disposed in a more simple and uniform %0a%3c manner : indeed, if this last were of sufficiently large size to %0a%3c admit of tables being made of it, there is no doubt that it %0a%3c would be preferred to the wood of the citrus even. At the %0a%3c present day, however, we find it but little used except for the %0a%3c leaves of tablets, or as a veneer for couches." Tuberosities are %0a%3c also found on the alder,''^ but as much inferior to those already %0a%3c mentioned, as the alder itself is to the maple. In the maple %0a%3c the male tree"^ is the first to blossom. The trees that frequent %0a%3c dry spots are preferred to those that grow in watery localities, %0a%3c which is the case also with the ash. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is found in the countries beyond the Alps a tree, the %0a%3c wood of which is ver)' similar to that of the white maple, and %0a%3c which is known as the staphylodendron.®* This tree bears a %0a%3c pod^* in which there is found a kernel, which has the flavour %0a%3c of the hazel-nut. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 28.

In c. 38, Pliny says, very in- %0a%3c correctly, that the alder has a remarkably thick leaf ; and in c. 45, witli %0a%3c equal incorrectness, that it bears neither seed nor fruit. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee observes, that it is incorrect to say that the male tree blossoms %0a%3c before the female, if such is Pliny's meaning here. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ From the Greek, meaning "a tree with clusters."

There are %0a%3c three'" varieties of it: the Gallic"^ box, which is trained to %0a%3c Blioot upwards in a pyramidal form, and attains a very consi- %0a%3c derable height; the oleaster,' which is condemned as being %0a%3c utterly worthless, and emits a disagreeable odour ; and a third, %0a%3c known as the " Italian" box,'^ a wihl variety, in my opinion, %0a%3c which has been improved by cultivation. This last spreads %0a%3c more than the others, and forms a thiclc hedge : it is an ever- %0a%3c green, and is easily clipped. %0a%3c %0a%3c The box-tree abounds on the Pyrenean^ range, the moun- %0a%3c tains of Cytorus, and the country about Berecynthus.* The %0a%3c trunk grows to the largest size in the island of Corsica,* and %0a%3c its blossom is by no means despicable ; it is this that causes %0a%3c the honey there to be bitter.^ The seed of the box is lield in %0a%3c aversion by all animals.

It is an erroneous theory %0a%3c that the leaf does not fall in those trees the juices of which %0a%3c are more unctuous than the rest ; for who could make out that %0a%3c such is the case with the holm-oak, for instance ? Timjeus, %0a%3c the mathematician, is of opinion that the leaves fall while the %0a%3c Bun is passing through the sign of Scorpio, being acted upon by %0a%3c the influences of that luminary, and a certain venom which %0a%3c exists in the atmosphere : but then we have a right to wonder %0a%3c how it is that, the same reasons existing, the same influence %0a%3c is not exercised equally on all. %0a%3c %0a%3c The leaves of most trees fall in autumn, but in some at a %0a%3c later period, remaining on the tree till the approach of winter, %0a%3c it making no difference whether they have germinated at an %0a%3c earlier period or a later, seeing that some that are the very %0a%3c first to bud are among the last to lose their leaves — the %0a%3c almond, the ash, and the elder, for instance : the mulberry, %0a%3c on the other hand, buds the last of all, and loses its leavi s %0a%3c among the very first. The soil, too, exercises a very consi- %0a%3c derable influence in this respect : the leaves falling sooner %0a%3c where it is dry and thin, and more particularly when the tree %0a%3c is old : indeed, there are many trees that lose them before the %0a%3c fruit is ripe, as in the case of the late fig, for instance, and the %0a%3c winter pear : on the pomegranate, too, the fruit, when ripe, %0a%3c beholds nothing but the trunk of the parent tree. And not %0a%3c even upon those trees which always retain theii- foliage do the %0a%3c same leaves always remain, for as others shoot up beneath tliem, %0a%3c the old leaves gradually wither away : this takes place about %0a%3c the solstices more particularly. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 35.

THE JUNIPER. %0a%3c %0a%3c The appearance of the blossom bespeaks the arrival of tho %0a%3c spring and the birth anew of the year ; this blossom is the %0a%3c \i'Ty pride and delight of the trees. Then it is that they %0a%3c show themselves quite renewed, and altogether different from %0a%3c Avhat they really are ; then it is that they quite revel in the con- %0a%3c test with each other which shall excel in tho various hues %0a%3c and tints which they display. This merit has, however, been %0a%3c denied to many of them ; for they do not all blossom, and %0a%3c there are certain sombre trees which do not participate in this %0a%3c joyous season of the year. The holm-oak, the pitch-tree, the %0a%3c larch, and the pine are never bedecked with blossoms, and %0a%3c with them there is no particular forerunner sent forth to an- %0a%3c nounce the yearly birth of their respective fruits. The same %0a%3c IS the case, too, with the cultivated and the wild fig,'» which %0a%3c immediately present their fruit in place of any blossom. Upon %0a%3c the fig, too, it is remarkable that there are abortive fruit to be %0a%3c seen which never ripen. %0a%3c %0a%3c The juniper, also, is destitute of blossom; some writers, %0a%3c however, distinguish two varieties of it, one of which blossoms %0a%3c but bears no fruit,^" while the other has no blossom, but pre- %0a%3c sents the berries immediately, which remain on the tree %0a%3c tor 80 long a period as two years : this assertion, however, is %0a%3c %0a%3c " This statement, as also that relative to the holm oak, and other trees %0a%3c previously mentioned, is quite incorrect.

THE FECUNDATION OF TREES. GEEMINATION : THE %0a%3c %0a%3c APPEAHANCE OF THE FKUIT. %0a%3c %0a%3c All trees germinate, however,**' even those which do not %0a%3c blossom. In this respect there is a very considerable differ- %0a%3c ence in relation to the various localities; for in the same %0a%3c species we find that the tree, when planted in a marshy spot, %0a%3c will germinate earlier than elsewhere ; next to that, the trees %0a%3c tiiat grow on the plains, and last of all those that are I'ound in %0a%3c the woods : the wild pear, too, is naturally later in budding %0a%3c than the other pears. At the first breath of the west wind" %0a%3c the cornel buds, and close upon it the laurel ; then, a little %0a%3c before the equinox, we find the lime and the maple germi- %0a%3c nating. Among the earlier trees, too, are the poplar, the elm, %0a%3c the willow, tile alder, and the nut-trees. The plane buds, %0a%3c too, at an early period. %0a%3c %0a%3c Others, again, germinate at the beginning of spring, the %0a%3c holly, for instance, the terebinth, the paliurus,"-* the chcsnut, %0a%3c and the glandiferous trees. On the other hand, the apple is %0a%3c late in budding, and the cork-tree the very last of all. Some %0a%3c trees germinate twice, whether it is that this arises from some %0a%3c exuberant fertility of the soil, or from the inviting tempe- %0a%3c rature of the atmosphere ; this takes place more particularly %0a%3c in the several varieties of the cereals. Excessive germination, %0a%3c however, has a tendency to weaken and exhaust the tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the spring budding, some trees have naturally an- %0a%3c other budding, which depends upon the influence of their own %0a%3c respective constellations,**' a theory which we shall find an %0a%3c «' These remarks, borrowed from Thcophrastus, are generally consis- %0a%3c tent with our ex pe' ieneo. „, , f %0a%3c «^ Fee remarks that Pliny here copies from Thcophrastus. a wntor ot %0a%3c (Jreeee, without making allowance for the difference ol localities. 1 ico- %0a%3c plirastus, however, gives the laurel an. earlier period for budding than %0a%3c Pliny does. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rbaninus paliurus of Linnaeus. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c neai'cr tiie roots. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 382 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny's natural uistort.

Some persons think that these %0a%3c two buddings are common to all trees, but that they are to be %0a%3c remarked more particularly in the fig, the vine, and the pome- %0a%3c granate ; seeing that, when this is the case, the crop of figs, in %0a%3c Thessaly and Macedonia more particularly, is remarkably abun- %0a%3c dant: but it is in Egypt more especially that illustrations of %0a%3c this vast abundance are to be met with. All the trees in %0a%3c general, when they have once begun to germinate, proceed %0a%3c continuously with it ; the robur, however, the tir-trce, and %0a%3c the larch germinate intermittent!)', ceasing thrice, and as %0a%3c many times*'' beginning to bud again, and hence it is that they %0a%3c shed the scales of their bark ^' three several times; a thing %0a%3c that takes place with all trees during the period of germina- %0a%3c tion, the outer coat of the tree bursting Avhile it is budding. %0a%3c %0a%3c With these last trees the first budding takes place^ at the %0a%3c beginning of spring, and lasts about fifteen days ; and they ger- %0a%3c minate a second time when the sun is passing through the %0a%3c sign of Gemini : hence it is that we see the points of the first %0a%3c buds pushed upwards by those beneath, a joint marking the %0a%3c place where they unite.*'-' The third germination of these %0a%3c trees takes place at the summer solstice, and lasts no more %0a%3c than seven days : at this period we may very distinctly detect %0a%3c the articulations by which the buds are joined to one another %0a%3c as they grow. The vine is the only tree that buds twice ; the %0a%3c first time when it first puts forth the grape, and the second time %0a%3c when the grape comes to maturity. In the trees which do not %0a%3c blossom there is only the budding, and then the gradual ripen- %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xviii. c. 57. %0a%3c 85 There is no such thing as a third budding. %0a%3c %0a%3c As already stated, there are never more than two germinations. %0a%3c %0a%3c This rupture of the epidermis, caused by the formation beneath of %0a%3c new ligneous and conical layers, takes place not solely, as Pliny and %0a%3c Theophrastus state, at the time of germination, but slowly and conti- %0a%3c nuously. %0a%3c %0a%3c On the contrary, they are irregular both in their commencement and %0a%3c their duration. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is not the case ; each bud is independent of the one that has %0a%3c preceded it. A sucker, liowever, newly devfloped may give birth to buds %0a%3c not at the extremity, but througliout the whole length of it. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 42.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c IX WHAT OEDEB TUBES BLOSSOM. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 383 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c ing of the fruit. Some trees blossom while they are budding, %0a%3c and pass rapidly through that period ; but the fruit is slow in %0a%3c coming to maturity, as in the vine, for instance. Other trees, %0a%3c again, blossom and bud but late, while the fruit comes to %0a%3c raatunty with great rapidity, the mulberry,^" for example, %0a%3c which is the very last to bud of all the cultivated trees, and %0a%3c then only when the cold weather is gone : for this reason %0a%3c it has been pronounced the wisest among the trees. But in %0a%3c this, the germination, when it has once begun, bursts forth all %0a%3c over the tree at the very same moment; so much so, indeed, %0a%3c that it is accomplished in a single night, and even with a %0a%3c noise that may be audibly heard.*' %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 42. IN WHAT ORDER THE TREES BLOSSOJT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of the trees which, as we have already stated,*- bud in win- %0a%3c ter at the rising of the Eagle, the almond blossoms the first %0a%3c of all, in the mouth of January*^ namely, while by March the %0a%3c fruit is well developed. Next to it in blossoming is the plum** %0a%3c of Armenia, and then the tuber and the early peach,'-'^ the first %0a%3c two being exotics, and the latter forced by the agency of culti- %0a%3c vation. Among the forest trees, the first that blossoms in the %0a%3c course of nature is the elder, *^ which has the most pith of any, %0a%3c and the male cornel, which has none*' at all. Among the %0a%3c cultivated trees we next have the apple, and immediately after %0a%3c — so much so, indeed, that it would almost appear that they %0a%3c blossom simultaneously — the pear, the cherry, and the plum. %0a%3c Next to these is the laurel, and then the cypress, and after %0a%3c that the pomegranate and the fig : the vine, too, and the olive %0a%3c are budding when these last trees are in fiower, the period of %0a%3c their conception'-'* being the rising of the Vergiliae,** that being %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ See B. xviii. c. 67.

The female* of this tree, after autumn, %0a%3c bears a sour berry, which no animal will touch ; its wood, %0a%3c too, is spongy and quite useless, while, on the otlier liand, that %0a%3c of the male tree is one of the very strongest and hardest® woods %0a%3c known : so great a difference do we find in trees belonging to %0a%3c the same species. The terebinth, the maple, and the ash pro- %0a%3c duce their seed at harvest-time, while the nut-trees, the apple, %0a%3c and the pear, with the exception of the winter or the more %0a%3c early kinds, bear fruit in autumn.

Indeed, there is no tree that %0a%3c is more eager to develope its resources ; for in the same month %0a%3c in which a nut is plucked from it, another will ripen in the %0a%3c same place ; the arrangement being such, that there is no %0a%3c month in which the nuts of this tree are not ripening.

TREES WHICH LOSE THEIK FRUIT OK FLOWERS MOST %0a%3c %0a%3c KEADILT. %0a%3c %0a%3c Young trees are unproductive'® so long as they are growing. %0a%3c The fruits which fall most readily before they come to maturity %0a%3c are the date, the fig, the almond, the apple, the pear, and the %0a%3c pomegranate, Avhich last tree is also very apt to lose its blossom %0a%3c through excessive dews and hoar frosts. For this reason it is, %0a%3c too, that the growers bend the branches of the pomegranate, lest, %0a%3c from being straight, they may receive and retain the moisture %0a%3c that is so injurious to them. The pear and the almond, even %0a%3c if it should not rain, but a south wind happen to blow or the %0a%3c weather become cloudy, are apt to lose their blossoms, and their %0a%3c first fruit as well, if, after the blossom has fallen, there is a %0a%3c continuance of such weather. Eut it is the willow that loses %0a%3c its seed the most speedily of all, long, indeed, before it is ripe; %0a%3c hence it Is that Homer has given it the epithet of " fruit- %0a%3c losing."^" Succeeding ages, however, have given to this tenu %0a%3c an interpretation conformable to their own wicked practices, it %0a%3c being a well-known fact that the seed of the willow has the %0a%3c effect of producing barrenness in females. %0a%3c %0a%3c In this respect, however, Nature has emploj^ed her usual %0a%3c foresight, bestowing but little care upon the seed of a tree %0a%3c which is produced so easily, and propagated by slips. There %0a%3c is, however, it is said, one variety of willow,^' the seed of which %0a%3c arrives at maturity : it is found in the Isle of Crete, at the %0a%3c descent from the grotto of J upiter : the seed is unsightly and %0a%3c ligneous, and in size about as large as a chick-pea. %0a%3c %0a%3c '8 This miist not be taken to the letter ; indeed, Fee thinks that the %0a%3c proper meaning is;— "Young trees do not produce fruit till they have %0a%3c arrived at a certain state of maturity."

This distinction may arise also from the sex : and %0a%3c when such is the case, it is the male-^ tree that never produces. %0a%3c Some authors, however, making a transposition, assert that it %0a%3c is the male trees only that are prolific. Barrenness may also %0a%3c arise from a tree being too thickly covered with leaves. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 48. THE MODE IN WHICH TREES BEAR. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some among the fruit -trees bear on both the sides of the %0a%3c branches and the summit, the pear, for instance, the fig- %0a%3c tree, and the myrtle. In other respects the trees are pretty %0a%3c nearly of a similar nature to the cereals, for in them we find %0a%3c the ear growing from the summit, while in the leguminous %0a%3c varieties the pod grows from the sides. The palm, as we have %0a%3c already^ stated, is the only one that has fruit hanging down %0a%3c in bunches enclosed in capsules. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 49. — TREES IN WHICH THE FRUIT APPEARS BEFORE THE %0a%3c LEAVES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The other trees, again, bear their fruit beneath the leaves, %0a%3c for the purpose of protection, with the exception of the fig, the %0a%3c leaf of which is very large, and gives a great abundance of %0a%3c shade ; hence it is that we find the fruit placed above it ; in %0a%3c addition to which, the leaf makes its appearance after the fruit. %0a%3c There is said to be a remarkable peculiarity connected with %0a%3c one species of fig that is found in Cilicia, Cyprus, and Hellas ; %0a%3c the fruit grows beneath the leaves, while at the same time the %0a%3c green abortive fruit, that never reaches maturity, is seen grow- %0a%3c ing on the top of them. There is also a tree that produces an %0a%3c %0a%3c " See B. XV. c 13. It is not impossible that Pliny may have mistaken %0a%3c here the Persca, or Balanites iEgyptiaca, for the Persica, or peach.

By the fi.rst crop the one that succeeds is sum- %0a%3c moned forth, and by that the third. It is by the agency of %0a%3c this last crop that caprification^" is performed. In the wild %0a%3c fig, too, the fruit grows on the opposite side of the leaves. %0a%3c There are some pears and apples, too, that bear two crops in %0a%3c the year, while there are some early varieties also. The wild %0a%3c apple bears twice in the year, its second crop coming on after %0a%3c the rising of Arcturus,^" in sunny localities more particularly. %0a%3c There are vines, too, that will even bear three times in the %0a%3c year, a circumstance that has procured for them the name of %0a%3c " frantic" " vines. On these we see grapes just ripening, others %0a%3c beginning to swell, and others, again, in blossom, all at the %0a%3c same moment. %0a%3c %0a%3c M. Varro^^ informs us, that there was formerly at Smyrna, %0a%3c near 3^ the Temple of the Mother of the Gods, a vine that bore %0a%3c two crops in the year, as also an apple-tree of a similar nature %0a%3c in the territory of Consentia. This, however, is constantly to %0a%3c be witnessed in the territory of Tacapa,^* in Africa, of which %0a%3c we shall have to speak more fully on another occasion,^' so %0a%3c remarkable is the fertility of the soil. The cypress also bears %0a%3c three times in the year, for its berries are gathered in the %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Or " forerunner." The Spaniards call a similar fig " brevas," the %0a%3c " ready ripener." %0a%3c %0a%3c 27 See B.

All trees, the older they grow, %0a%3c the more early they bear, and this more particularly in sunny %0a%3c spots and where the soil is not over- rich. AU the forest-trees %0a%3c are slower in bringing their fruit to maturity ; and indeed, in %0a%3c some of them the fruit never becomes fully ripe." Those trees, %0a%3c too, about the roots of which the earth is ploughed or broken %0a%3c and loosened, bring their fruit to maturity more speedily than %0a%3c those in which this has been neglected ; by this process they %0a%3c are also rendered more fruitful. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 51. WHICH TREES BECOME OLD WITH THE GREATEST %0a%3c %0a%3c KAPIDITr, AND WHICH MOST SLOWLY. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are great differences also in trees in respect to age. %0a%3c The almond and the pear^* are the most fruitful when old, which %0a%3c is the case also with the glandiferous trees and a certaiu spe- %0a%3c cies of fig. Others, again, are most prolific when young, %0a%3c though the fruit is later in coming to maturitj^, a thing parti- %0a%3c cularly to be observed in the vine ; for in those that are old %0a%3c the wine is of better quality, while the produce of the younger %0a%3c trees is given in greater abundance. The apple-tree becomes %0a%3c old very early, and the fruit which it produces when old is of %0a%3c inferior quality, being of smaller size and very liable to be %0a%3c attacked by maggots : indeed, these insects will breed in the %0a%3c tree itself. The fig is the only one of all the fruit-trees that is %0a%3c submitted to any process with the view of expediting the %0a%3c ripening of the fruit, a marvellous thing, indeed, that a greater %0a%3c value should be set upon produce that comes out of its proper %0a%3c season ! All trees which bear their fruit before the proper %0a%3c time become prematurely'"' old ; indeed, some of them wither %0a%3c ^ B.

On the other hand, the mulberry becomes aged" but %0a%3c very slowly, and is never exhausted by its crops. Those trees, %0a%3c too, the wood of which is variegated, arrive at old age but %0a%3c slowly, — the palm, the maple, and the poplar, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c (29.) Trees grow old more rapidly when the earth is %0a%3c ploughed and loosened about the^- roots ; forest trees at a later %0a%3c period. Speaking in general terms, we may say that care %0a%3c employed in the culture of trees seems to promote their fer- %0a%3c tility, while increased fertility accelerates old age. Hence it %0a%3c is that the carefully tended trees are the first to blossom, and %0a%3c the first to bud ; in a word, are the most precocious in every %0a%3c respect : but all natural productions which are in any way %0a%3c weakened are more susceptible of atmospheric influences. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 52. TREES WHICH BEAK VAEIOUS PEODUCTS.

In the number of these there is the laurel, %0a%3c which bears its own peculiar kind of grape, and more parti- %0a%3c cularly the barren laurel,** which bears nothing else ; for %0a%3c which reason it is looked upon by some persons as the male %0a%3c tree. The filbert, too, bears catkins, which are hard and com- %0a%3c pact, but of no use** whatever. %0a%3c %0a%3c (30.)

DIFFEKEjrCES IN TEEES IN KESPECT OF THE TETTNKa %0a%3c %0a%3c AND BEANCHES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some trees are of a simple form, and have but a single trunk %0a%3c rising from the root, together with numerous branches ; such %0a%3c as the olive, for instance, the fig, and the vine ; others again are %0a%3c of a shrubby nature, such as the paliurus,*'* the myrtle, and %0a%3c the filbert ; which last, indeed, is all the better, and the %0a%3c more abundant its fruit, the more numerous its branches. In %0a%3c Borae trees, again, there is no trunk at all, as is the case with %0a%3c one species of box,** and the lotus*" of the parts beyond sea. %0a%3c Some trees are bifurcated, while there are some that branch %0a%3c out into as many as five parts. Others, again, divide in the %0a%3c trunk but have no branches, as in the case of the elder; Avhile %0a%3c others have no division in the trunk but throw out branches, %0a%3c Buch as the pitch-tree, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c In some trees the branches are symmetrically arranged, the %0a%3c pitch-tree and the fir, for example ; while with others they %0a%3c are dispersed without any order or regularity, as in the robur, %0a%3c the apple, and the pear. In the fir the branches are thrown %0a%3c out from the trunk straight upwards, pointing to the sky, and %0a%3c not drooping downw'ards from the sides of the trunk. It is %0a%3c a singular thing,** but this tree wdll die if the ends of its %0a%3c branches are cut, though, if taken ofi' altogether, no bad effect %0a%3c is produced. If it is cut, too, below the place w^here the %0a%3c branches were, the part of the tree w^liich is left will continue %0a%3c to Uve ; but if, on the other hand, the top only of the tree is %0a%3c removed, the whole of it will die. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' See c, 93, where he enlarges on the varieties of the mistletoe. %0a%3c %0a%3c 18 See B. xxiv. c. 71. . , . t, , %0a%3c %0a%3c lie means the garden or border-box, mentioned in c. 28 of this Book. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5" See B. xiii. c. 17 : the African lotus, probably; the Zizyphus lotus %0a%3c of Desfontaincs. , • i t, j %0a%3c %0a%3c 51 Tills statement is entirely incorrect.

For %0a%3c sheltering houses these trees are more particularly esteemed, %0a%3c as they throw out their branches to a considerable distajice, %0a%3c from a short trunk, thus affording a very extensive shade, and %0a%3c very frequently encroaching upon the neighbouring mansions. %0a%3c There is no tree, however, the shade afforded by which is less %0a%3c long-lived than this, and when it loses its leaves in winter, %0a%3c it affords no shelter from the sun. No tree has a more sightly %0a%3c bark, or one Avhich has greater attractions for the eye ; or %0a%3c branches which are longer, stouter, or more numerous; in- %0a%3c deed, one might almost look upon them as forming so many %0a%3c trees. The bark*® of it is used for dyeing skins, and the root %0a%3c for colouring wool. %0a%3c %0a%3c The branches of the apple-tree have a peculiar conformation; %0a%3c knots are formed which resemble the muzzles*^ of wild beasts, %0a%3c several smaller ones being united to a larger. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 54. THE BEANCHES OF TEEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c Some of the branches are barren, and do not germinate; this %0a%3c takes place either from a natural deficiency of strength, or else %0a%3c some injury received in consequence of having been cut, and %0a%3c the cicatrix impeding the natural functions. The same that the %0a%3c branch is in the trees that spread out, is the eye*® in the vine, %0a%3c and the joint in the reed. All trees are naturally the thickest %0a%3c in the parts that are nearest the ground. The fir, the larch, the %0a%3c palm, the cypress, and the elm, and, indeed, every tree that %0a%3c has but a single trunk, develope themselves in their remark- %0a%3c able height. Among the branchy trees the cherry is some- %0a%3c times*^ found to yield a beam forty cubits in length by two in %0a%3c %0a%3c 5= The Celtis australis of Linnaeus. Pliny is in error in calling this tree %0a%3c the " Grecian bean." In B. xiii. c. 22, he erroneously calls the African %0a%3c lotus by the name of " celtis," which only belongs to the lotus of Italy ; %0a%3c that of Africa being altogether different. %0a%3c %0a%3c The bark, which is astringent, is still used in preparing skins, and a %0a%3c black colouring matter extracted from the root is employed in dyeing wool. %0a%3c %0a%3c *'' Quite an accidental resemblance, if, indeed, it ever existed. %0a%3c " Oculus " — the bud on the trunk. %0a%3c %0a%3c *' This must be either a mistake or an exaggeration ; the cherry never %0a%3c being a very large tree. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 56.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c THE KOOTS or TBEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 393 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c thickness throughout.

THE BARK OF TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In some trees the bark«" is thin, as in the laurel and the %0a%3c lime ; in others, again, it is thick, as in the robur ; in some it is %0a%3c smooth, as in the apple and the fig, while in the robur and the %0a%3c palm it is rough : in aU kinds it becomes more -wrinkled when %0a%3c the tree is old. In some trees the bark bursts spontaneously, %0a%3c as in the vine for instance, while in others it falls off even, as %0a%3c •we see in the apple and the arbutus. In the cork-tree and %0a%3c the poplar, the bark is substantial and fleshy ; in the vine and %0a%3c the reed it is membraneous. In the cherry it is similar to %0a%3c the coats of the papyrus, while in the vine, the lime, and the %0a%3c fir, it is composed of numerous layers. In others, again, it is %0a%3c single, the fig and the reed for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 56. — THE ROOTS OF TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are great differences, too, in the roots of trees. In the %0a%3c fig, the robur, and the plane, they are numerous ; in the apple %0a%3c they are short and thin, while in the fir and the larch they %0a%3c are single ; and by this single root is the tree supported, al- %0a%3c though we find some small fibres thrown out from it laterally. %0a%3c They are thick and unequal in the laurel and the olive, in %0a%3c which last they are branchy also ; while in the robur they %0a%3c are solid and fleshy.*' The robur, too, throws its roots down- %0a%3c wards to a very considerable depth. Indeed, if we are to be- %0a%3c lieve Virgil,''- the sesculus has a root that descends as deep %0a%3c into the earth as the height to which the trunk ascends in tlie %0a%3c air. The roots of the olive, the apple, and the cypress, creep %0a%3c almost upon the very surface : in some trees they run straight %0a%3c and horizontally, as in the laurel and the olive ; while in others %0a%3c they have a sinuous course — the fig for example. In some %0a%3c trees the roots ai'e bristling with small filaments, as in the %0a%3c fir, and many of the forest trees ; the mountaineers cut off %0a%3c %0a%3c It is evident that he is speaking of the epidermis only, and not the %0a%3c cortical layers and tlie liber. %0a%3c %0a%3c The roots of trees being ligneous, " carnosse," Fee remarks, is an in- %0a%3c iippropriate term. %0a%3c %0a%3c Georg. ii. 291. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 394 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c flint's NATUBAL HISTOKT.

This, however, I look upon" %0a%3c as a mistake : and, in fact, we find it stated by some authors %0a%3c that a fir was transplanted, the roots of which had penetrated %0a%3c eight cubits in depth, and even then the whole of it was not %0a%3c dug up, it being torn asunder.*^ The citrus has a root that %0a%3c goes the very deepest of all, and is of great extent ; next after %0a%3c it come the plane, the robur, and the various glandiferous %0a%3c trees. In some trees, the laurel for instance, the roots are %0a%3c more tenacious of life the nearer they are to the surface: %0a%3c hence, when the trunk withers, it is cut down, and the tree %0a%3c shoots again with redoubled vigour. Some think that the %0a%3c shorter the roots are, the more rapidly the tree decays ; a sup- %0a%3c position which is plainly contradicted by the fig, the root of %0a%3c which is among the very largest, while the tree becomes aged %0a%3c at a remarkably early period. I regard also as incorrect what %0a%3c some authors have stated, as to the roots of trees diminishing" %0a%3c when they are old ; for I once saw an ancient oak, uprooted %0a%3c by a storm, the roots of which covered a jugerum of ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 57.

A prodigy of this nature happened to %0a%3c the citizens of Home during tlieir wars with the Cimbri : at %0a%3c Nuceria, in the grove consecrated to Juno, an elm inclined %0a%3c to such a degree, even after the top had been cut ofiF, as %0a%3c to overhang the altar there, but it afterwards recovered itself %0a%3c to such an extent as to blossom immediately : it was from that %0a%3c very moment, too, that the majesty of the Roman people began %0a%3c to flourish once again after it had been laid low by disaster %0a%3c and defeat.

This tree is sacred to Pluto, %0a%3c and hence it is used as a sign of mourning''^ placed at th^ %0a%3c entrance of a house : the female^" tree is for a long time barren. %0a%3c The pyramidal appearance that it presents has caused it not to %0a%3c be rejected, but for a long time it was only used for marking %0a%3c the intervals between rows of pines : at the present day, how- %0a%3c ever, it is clipped and trained to form hedge-rows, or else is %0a%3c thinned and lengthened out in the various designs'^ employed in %0a%3c ornamental gardening, and which represent scenes of hunting, %0a%3c fleets, and various other objects : these it covers with a thin %0a%3c small leaf, which is always green. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are two varieties of the cypress ; the one^- taperin* %0a%3c and pyramidal, and which is known as the female ; while the %0a%3c male tree^^ throws its branches straight out from the body, and %0a%3c is often pruned and employed as a rest for the vine.

Indeed, %0a%3c the torrents very often bring down with them seeds, and some- %0a%3c times we find those of unknown kinds even floating alopg. %0a%3c This took place in the territory of Cyrenaica, at the period %0a%3c when laser was first grown there, as we shall have occasion to %0a%3c mention when we speak of the nature of the various herbs. %0a%3c A forest, too, sprang^ up in the vicinity of the city of Cyrene, %0a%3c just after a shower of rain, of a dense, pitchy liature, about %0a%3c the year of the City of Eome 430. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 62.

The ivy is injurious* to all trees %0a%3c and plants, and makes its way through tombs and walls ; it %0a%3c forms a haunt much frequented by serpents, for its refreshing %0a%3c coolness ; so that it is a matter for astonishment that there %0a%3c should have been such remarkable veneration for this plant. %0a%3c %0a%3c The two principal kinds in the ivy, as in other plants, are %0a%3c the male tree and the female.® The male is .said to have a %0a%3c larger trunk than the female, and a leaf that is harder and %0a%3c more unctuous, with a flower nearly approaching to purple : %0a%3c indeed, the flower of both the male and female tree strongly %0a%3c resembles the wiW-rose, were it not destitute of smell. Each %0a%3c of these kinds of ivy is divided into three other varieties : %0a%3c the white** ivy, the black,® and a third known as the helix." %0a%3c These varieties are again subdivided into others, as there is %0a%3c one in which the fruit only is white, and another in which it %0a%3c is only the leaf that is so. In those which have a white fruit, %0a%3c the berry in some cases is closely packed and large, the clusters, %0a%3c which are known as " corymbi," being of a spherical form. %0a%3c So, too, with the selenitium, which has a smaller berry, and %0a%3c fewer clusters ; and the same is the case with the black ivy. %0a%3c One kind has a black seed, and another a seed of a safiEron" %0a%3c colour — it is this last that poets use for their chaplets,'^ and %0a%3c the leaves of it are not so black as in the other kinds : by some %0a%3c %0a%3c * Bacchus, after the alleged conquest by him of India, was said to %0a%3c have returned crowned with ivy, and seated in a car drawn by tigers. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 It is a mistake to suppose that the ivy exhausts the juices of trees. %0a%3c Its tendrils fasten upon the cortical fissures ; and, if the tree is but small, %0a%3c its development is apt to be retarded thereby.

Some of the Greek writers even distinguish %0a%3c in this last kind two varieties, according to the colour of the %0a%3c berries, the erythranum" and the chrysocarpus.'* %0a%3c %0a%3c It is the helix, however, that has thfe most peculiarities of %0a%3c all, and in the appearance of the leaf more particularly, which %0a%3c IS small, angular, and of a more elegant shape, the leaf in all %0a%3c the other kinds being plain and simple. It differ.s, too, in the %0a%3c distance between the joints, and in being barren more espe- %0a%3c ciall)-, as it never bears fruit. Some authors, however, think %0a%3c that this difference exists solely in respect of age and not of %0a%3c kind, and are of opinion that what is the helix when young, %0a%3c becomes the ordinary i\'y when old. This, however, is clearly %0a%3c proved to be an error upon their part, for we find more varieties %0a%3c of the helix than one, and three in particular — that of a grass- %0a%3c green colour, Avhich is the most abundant of all, the kind with %0a%3c :i white leaf, and a third, which is parti-coloured, and known %0a%3c as the Thracian helix. In that of a grass-green colour, the %0a%3c leaves are smaller, more closely packed together, and symmetri- %0a%3c cally arranged ; while in the other kinds the features are alto- %0a%3c gether different. In the parti-coloured kind, also, one varir^ty %0a%3c has a smaller leaf than usual, similarly arranged, and lying %0a%3c closer together, while in the other none of these features are %0a%3c observed. The leaves, too, are either greater or smaller and %0a%3c differ in the disposition of the spots upon them, and in the %0a%3c white helix some of them are whiter than others : the grass- %0a%3c green variety, however, is the one that grows to the greatest %0a%3c height. %0a%3c %0a%3c The white helix is in the habit of killing trees by depriving %0a%3c them of their juices, and increases to such a degree of density %0a%3c as to be quite a tree itself. Its characteristics are, a very %0a%3c large, broad, leaf, and projecting buds, which in all the other %0a%3c kinds are bent inwards ; its clusters, too, stand out erect. %0a%3c Although, too, all the ivies have arms that throw out a root, %0a%3c those of this variety are particularly branchy and strong ; next %0a%3c to it in strength, are those of the black ivy. %0a%3c %0a%3c '3 See B.

There is an ivy also which grows %0a%3c upright, and stands without any support; being the only %0a%3c one that does so among all the varieties, it has thence ob- %0a%3c tained the distinctive name of " cissos." The chamsecissos," %0a%3c on the other hand, is never found except creeping upon the %0a%3c ground. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 63. (35.) THE S3I1LAX. %0a%3c %0a%3c Very similar to the ivy is a plant which first came from %0a%3c Cilicia, but is now more commonly found in Greece, and %0a%3c known by the name of smilax.^* It has numerous thick stalks %0a%3c covered with joints, and thorny branches of a shrub-like form : %0a%3c the leaf resembles that of the ivy, but is not angular, while %0a%3c from the foot-stalk it throws out tendrils ; the flower is white, %0a%3c and has the smell of the lily. It bears clusters like those of %0a%3c the wild vine and not the ivy, and of a reddish colour. The %0a%3c larger berries contain three stones, the smaller but one only : %0a%3c these berries are black and hard. This plant is loolced upon %0a%3c as ill-omened, and is consequently banished from all sacred %0a%3c rites, and is allowed to form no part of chaplets ; having re- %0a%3c ceived this mournful character from the maiden Smilax, who %0a%3c upon her love being slighted by the youth Crocus, was trans- %0a%3c formed into this shrub. The common people, being mostly %0a%3c ignorant of this, not unfrequently take it for ivy, and pollute %0a%3c theu" festivities with its presence ; for who, in fact, is unaware %0a%3c %0a%3c 1^ This is the case sometimes with the black ivy, the Hedera arborea of %0a%3c C. Bauhin. Only isolated cases, however, are to be met with. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1'' There is an ivy of this kind, the Hedera humi repens of botanists ; %0a%3c but most of the commentators are of opinion that it is the ground ivy, the %0a%3c Glechoma hederacea of Linnaeus, that is spoken of.

Reeds are employed, too, %0a%3c for writing upon paper, those of Egypt more particularly, which %0a%3c have a close affinity to the papyrus : the most esteemed, how- %0a%3c ever, are the reeds of Cnidos, and those which grow in Asia, %0a%3c on the margin of the Anaitic Lake there. %0a%3c %0a%3c The reed of our country is naturally of a more fungous %0a%3c nature, being formed of a spongy cartilage, which is hoUow- %0a%3c within, and covered by a thin, dry, woody coat without ; it %0a%3c easily breaks into splinters, which are remarkably sharp at the %0a%3c edge. In other respects, it is of a thin, graceful shape, arti- %0a%3c culated with joints, and tapering gradually towards the top, %0a%3c which ends in a thick, hairy tuft. This tuft is not without %0a%3c its uses, as it is employed for filling the beds used in taverns, %0a%3c in place of feathers ; or else, when it has assumed a more %0a%3c hgneous consistency, it is pounded, as we see done among the %0a%3c Belgae, and inserted between the joints of ships, to close the %0a%3c %0a%3c " Fke is inclined to question this ; but the breadth of the tablets may %0a%3c have been very small in this instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Of course this is fabulous: though it is not impossible that the %0a%3c writing on the tablets may sometimes have caused " a noise in the world," %0a%3c and that hence the poets may have given rise to this story. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny borrows this fabulous story from Cato, De Re Rust. c. 3. %0a%3c ^ The reeds cannot be appropriately ranked among the shrubs. %0a%3c For musical purposes, namely. %0a%3c B.

By the %0a%3c addition of feathers they accelerate the flight of this instru- %0a%3c ment of death, and the weapon, if it breaks in the wound, %0a%3c furnishes the combatants with a weapon afresh. With these %0a%3c missUcs the warriors darken the very rays of the sun.'-'*' It is %0a%3c for this reason more particularly that they desire a clear and %0a%3c serene sky, and hold in abhorrence all windy and rainy weather, %0a%3c which has the effect of compelling them, in spite of them- %0a%3c selves, to be at peace with one another. %0a%3c %0a%3c If a person were carefully to enumerate the peoples of %0a%3c -Slthiopia, Egypt, Ai'abia, India, Scythia, Bactria, and Sarmatia, %0a%3c together with all the numerous peoples of the East, and the %0a%3c vast realms of the Parthians, he would find that fully one-half %0a%3c of mankind throughout the whole world live under a dominion %0a%3c imposed by the agency of the arrow. It was their surpassing %0a%3c excellence in this arm that so ennobled the warriors of Crete, %0a%3c though in this respect, as well as in all others, Italy has %0a%3c gained the mastery ; there being no reed in existence better %0a%3c adapted for making arrows than that found in the Ehenus, a %0a%3c river of the territory of Bononia : filled*with a greater quan- %0a%3c tity of pith than any of the others, it is light, and easily %0a%3c cleaves the air, while at the same time it has sufficient weight %0a%3c to resist the action of the wind ; an advantage that is not %0a%3c possessed in an equal degree by those employed among the %0a%3c Belgae. These advantages, however, are possessed by the %0a%3c most approved kinds that are found in Crete, although those %0a%3c %0a%3c -5 " Calamus." The so-called reed of the East, used for making darts and %0a%3c arrows, does not belong to the genus Arundo, but to those of the Bambos %0a%3c and Nastus. %0a%3c %0a%3c 28 Few readers of history will fail to recollect the report made to King %0a%3c Eenry V. b.y Davy Gam, before the battle of Agincomt : — "The enemy %0a%3c are so numerous," said the messenger, " that their arrows will darken the %0a%3c sun."

The Indians assure %0a%3c us that in this plant, too, there is the distinction of male and %0a%3c female ; the body of the male being more compact, and that %0a%3c of the female of a larger size. In addition to this, if we can %0a%3c credit the fact, a single compartment between the joints is %0a%3c sufficiently large to answer the purposes of a boat." These %0a%3c reeds are found more particularly on the banlis of the river %0a%3c Acesines. %0a%3c %0a%3c In everj^ variety of the reed a single root gives birth to %0a%3c numerous stems, and if cut down, they will shoot again with %0a%3c increased fecundity. The root, which is naturally tenacious %0a%3c of life, is also jointed as well as the stem. The reeds of India %0a%3c are the only ones in which the leaves are short ; but in all the %0a%3c varieties these leaves take their rise at the joints, and surround %0a%3c the stem with a fine tissue about half way upwards to the %0a%3c next joint, and then leave the stem and droop downwards. %0a%3c The reed, as weU as the calamus, although rounded, has two %0a%3c sides, which throw out leaves alternately from above the joints, %0a%3c in such a way that when one springs from the right side, the %0a%3c next issues from the joint above it on the left, and so in %0a%3c turns. Branches, too, shoot occasionally from the stem, being %0a%3c themselves reeds of diminutive growth. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 66.

That known as the donax, throws out %0a%3c the most shoots, and grows only in watery localities; in- %0a%3c deed, this is a point which constitutes a very considerable %0a%3c difference, those reeds being greatly preferred which grow %0a%3c iu a dry soil. The archer's reed forms a peculiar species, as %0a%3c we have already stated but that of Crete has the longest %0a%3c intervals between the joints, and when subjected to heat is %0a%3c capable of being rendered perfectly pliable^* at pleasure. The %0a%3c leaves, too, constitute different varieties, not only by their %0a%3c number, but their colour also. The reed of Laconia is spot- %0a%3c ted,^^ and throws out a greater number of shoots at the lower %0a%3c extremities ; being very similar in nature, it is thought, to %0a%3c the reeds that we find growing about stagnant waters, and %0a%3c unlike those of the rivers, in Ibeing covered with leaves of %0a%3c considerable length; which, climbing upwards, embrace the %0a%3c stem to a considerable distance above the joints. There is %0a%3c also an obHquely-spreading reed, which does not shoot up- %0a%3c wards to any height, but spreads out like a shrub, keeping %0a%3c close to the earth ; this reed is much sought by animals when %0a%3c young, and is known by some persons as the elegia.^* There %0a%3c is in Italy, too, a substance found in the marsh-reeds, called %0a%3c by the name of adarca it is only to be found issuing from the %0a%3c cuter skin, below the flossy head of the plant, and is particularly %0a%3c %0a%3c 23 Or the pipe-reed. %0a%3c %0a%3c 30 The tibia, or pipe, was played lengthwise, like the flageolet or %0a%3c Clarionet. %0a%3c %0a%3c A variety of the Arundo donax.

Characias^' %0a%3c was the name given there to a reed of stout and compact %0a%3c quality, while a thinner one was known as the plotias; this last %0a%3c was to be found growing on the floating islands there, while %0a%3c the former grew upon the banks that were covered by the %0a%3c waters of the lake. A third kind again, which had the name %0a%3c of "auleticon," was the same that is now know^n as the mu- %0a%3c sical pipe 2^ reed. This reed used to take nine years to grow, %0a%3c as it was for that period that the waters of the lake were %0a%3c continually on the increase ; it used to be looked upon as a %0a%3c prodigy of evil omen, if at the end of its rise its waters re- %0a%3c mained overflowing so long as a couple of years ; a thing that %0a%3c was observed at the period of the Athenian disasters at Che- %0a%3c ronaea, and on various other occasions. This lake has the name %0a%3c of Lebaida, at the part where the river Cephisus enters it. %0a%3c %0a%3c When this inundation has lasted so long as a year, the %0a%3c reed is found large enough to be available for the purposes of %0a%3c fowling : at this period it used to be called zeugites.*" On the %0a%3c other hand, when the waters subsided at an earlier period, the %0a%3c reeds were known as bombycise,''' being of a more slender form. %0a%3c In this variety, too, the leaf of the female plant was broader %0a%3c and whiter than that of the others, while that upon which %0a%3c there was little or no down bore the name of the eunuch reed. %0a%3c The stem of this last variety was used for the manufacture of %0a%3c concert^- flutes. I must not here pass by in silence the mar- %0a%3c vellous care which the ancients lavished upon tliese instru- %0a%3c ments, a thing which will, in some measure, plead as an apo- %0a%3c logy for the manufacture of them at the present day of silver %0a%3c in preference. The reed used to be cut, as it was then looked %0a%3c upon as being in the best condition, at the rising of Arcturus %0a%3c %0a%3c The Arundo phragmites of Linnaeus.

At that period even the reed required consi- %0a%3c derable seasoning to render it pliable, and to be instructed, as %0a%3c it were, in the proper modulation of its sounds ; the mouth- %0a%3c piece and stops ^* being naturally contracted, and so producing %0a%3c a music better adapted to the theatrical taste of the day. %0a%3c But in later times, when the music became more varied, and %0a%3c luxury began to exercise its influence upon the musical taste, %0a%3c it became the general usage to cut the reeds before the summer %0a%3c solstice, and to make them fit for use at the end of three %0a%3c months; the stops and mouth-piece being found, when the %0a%3c reeds were cut at that period, to be more open and better %0a%3c adapted for the modifications of sound : it is in this state that %0a%3c the reed is used for similar purposes at the present day. In %0a%3c those times it was a very general persuasion also, that every %0a%3c pipe ought to have the tongue of its own mouth-piece cut %0a%3c from the same reed as itself, and that a section from the part %0a%3c nearest the root was best adapted to form the left-handed %0a%3c flute,'*^ and from the part adjoining the top the right-handed %0a%3c one : those reeds, too, were considered immeasurably superior, %0a%3c which had been washed by the waters of Cephisus itself. %0a%3c %0a%3c At the present day the sacrificial pipes used by the Tuscans %0a%3c are made of box-wood, while those employed at the games are %0a%3c made of the lotus,*® the bones of the ass, or else silver.

It is not, however, because the willow is %0a%3c the only tree that produces withes ; for they may be procured %0a%3c also from the broom, the poplar, the elm, the blood-red cornel, %0a%3c the birch, and the reed itself when split, or else the leaves of that %0a%3c plant, as we know to be the case in Liguria.

(38.) — THE JUICES OF TREES. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is a juice in the bark of trees, which must be looked %0a%3c upon as their blood, though it is not of a similar nature in all. %0a%3c In the fig it is of a milky consistency, and has the peculiar %0a%3c property of curdling milk, and so forming cheese."" In the %0a%3c cherry-tree this juice is gummy, in the elm clammy, in the %0a%3c apple viscous and fatty, while in the vine and the pear it is %0a%3c watery. The more viscous this humour is, the more long- %0a%3c lived the tree. In a word, we find in the bodies of trees — as %0a%3c with all other beings that are animated — skin, blood, flesli, %0a%3c sinews, veins, bones, and marrow ; the bark serving them in %0a%3c place of skin. It is a singular fact connected with the mul- %0a%3c berry-tree, that when the medical men wish to extract its juice, %0a%3c if the incision is lightly made, by a blow with a stone, and at %0a%3c the second hour of the day in spring, the juice will flow : but %0a%3c if, on the other hand, a w^ound is inflicted to any depth, it has %0a%3c all the appearance of being dried iip. %0a%3c %0a%3c Immediately beneath the bark in most trees there is a fatty %0a%3c substance, which, from its colour, has obtained the name of %0a%3c alburnum it is soft, and is the very worst part of the wood, %0a%3c %0a%3c Linnaeus ; the same as the Eubus tomentosus, and the Rubus corylifolius %0a%3c of other modern botanists. %0a%3c %0a%3c The Rosa canina of Linnaeus : the dog-rose or Eglantine. %0a%3c '1 The Rubus Idoeus of botanists ; the ordinary raspberry. %0a%3c %0a%3c See B. xxiv. c. 75. ggg jj^ xxiv. c. 3-5. %0a%3c %0a%3c '3 They are still used for dyeing, but not for staining the hair. %0a%3c Only as a purgative, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c Tliough the acid it contains would curdle milk, still its natural %0a%3c acridity would disqualify it from being used for making cheese. %0a%3c %0a%3c The white sap or inner bark ; the aubier of the French.

It is not all trees, too, that %0a%3c have this fat and flesh in any abundance, the same as we find %0a%3c to be the case among the more active animals. The box, the %0a%3c cornel, and the olive have none at all, nor yet any marrow, and %0a%3c a very small proportion, too, of blood. In the same way, too, %0a%3c the service-tree has no bones, and the elder no flesh, Avhile %0a%3c both of them have marrow in the greatest abundance. Reeds, %0a%3c too, have hardly any flesh. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 73. THE VEINS AND FIBKES OF TllEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c In the flesh of some trees we find both fibres'® and veins : %0a%3c they are easily distinguished. The veins'^ are larger, while %0a%3c the fibres are of whiter material, and are to be found in those %0a%3c woods more particularly which are easily split. Hence it is that %0a%3c if the ear is applied to the extremity of a beam of wood, how- %0a%3c ever long, a tap with a graver**" even upon the other end may %0a%3c be distinctly heard, the sound penetrating by the passages %0a%3c which run straight through it : by these means it is that we %0a%3c ascertain whether timber runs awry, or is interrupted by knots. %0a%3c The tuberosities which we find on trees resemble the kernels®^ %0a%3c that are formed in flesh : they contain neither veins nor fibres, %0a%3c but only a kind of tough, solid flesh, rolled up in a sort of %0a%3c ball : it is these tuberosities that are the most esteemed parts**^ %0a%3c in the citrus and the maple.

"Wood %0a%3c is always put lengthwise into the water to season, as that part %0a%3c which was nearest the root will sink to a greater*® depth than %0a%3c the other. In some wood there is fibre, without veins, and merely %0a%3c consisting of filaments slightly knit together : wood of this %0a%3c nature is remarkably fissile. Other wood, again, is more easily %0a%3c broken across than split, such as the wood of those trees that %0a%3c have no fibre, the olive and the vine, for instance : on the other %0a%3c hand, in the fig-tree, the whole of the body consists of flesh." %0a%3c The holm-oak, the cornel, the robur, the cytisus, the mulberry, %0a%3c the ebony, the lotus, and the other trees which we have %0a%3c mentioned"^ as being destitute of marrow, consist entirely of %0a%3c bone.**" All these woods are of a blackish colour, with the %0a%3c exception of the cornel, of which glossy yellow hunting- spears %0a%3c are made, marked with incisions for their further embellish- %0a%3c ment.

THE TELLING OF TKEES. %0a%3c %0a%3c The proper time for felling trees that are wanted for %0a%3c barking, the round, tapering trees, for instance, that are em- %0a%3c ployed in temples and for other purposes, is at the period of %0a%3c gemmation for at other times it is quite impossible to %0a%3c detach the bark from the rotten wood that adheres to it, while %0a%3c the wood itself assumes a blackish hue. Squared logs, and %0a%3c wood from which the bark has been lopped, are generally cut %0a%3c m the period that intervenes between the winter solstice and %0a%3c the prevalence of the west winds ; or else, if it is necessary %0a%3c to anticipate that period, at the setting of Arcturus and %0a%3c before that of the Lyre, the very earliest period being the %0a%3c summer solstice : the days of these respective constellations %0a%3c will be mentioned in the appropriate placo.^^ %0a%3c %0a%3c In general it is looked upon as quite suflacient to use all %0a%3c due precaution that a tree is not rough-hewn before it has %0a%3c borne its yearly crop. The robur, if cut in spring, is subject %0a%3c to the attacks of wood -worm, but if cut in winter, will neither %0a%3c rot nor warp : otherwise it is very liable to bend and become %0a%3c awry, as well as to crack ; the same is the case, too, with the %0a%3c cork-tree, even if cut down at the proper time. The state of %0a%3c the moon,** too, is of infinite importance, and it is generally %0a%3c recommended that trees should be cut only between the twen- %0a%3c tieth and the thirtieth days of the month. It is generally %0a%3c agreed, however, by all, that it is the very best time for %0a%3c felling timber, when the moon is in conjunction with the %0a%3c sun, a day which is called by some persons the interlu- %0a%3c iiium, and by others the moon's silence. At all events, it was %0a%3c %0a%3c " Limo:" the alburnum previously mentioned. %0a%3c ^ This practice was formerly forbidden by the forest laws of France. %0a%3c In B. xviii. %0a%3c %0a%3c Pliny borrows this superstition from Theophrastus, Ilist.

Some persons say that the %0a%3c moon ought not only to be in conjunction, but below the ho- %0a%3c rizon as well, a thing that can only happen in the night. If the %0a%3c conjunction should chance to fall on the very day of the winter %0a%3c solstice, the timber, they say, that is then felled will be of ever- %0a%3c lasting duration ; the next best being the timber that is cut %0a%3c when the conjunction coincides with the constellations pre- %0a%3c viously mentioned. There are some, too, who add th%3c; rising %0a%3c of the Dog-star as a favourable time, and say that it was at %0a%3c this period that the timber was cut which was employed in %0a%3c building the Forum of Augustus. %0a%3c %0a%3c Wood which is intended for timber ought to be cut neither %0a%3c when too young nor too old. Some persons, too — and the prac- %0a%3c tice is by no means without its utility — cut round ^ the tree as %0a%3c far as the pith, and then leave the timber standing, so that all %0a%3c the juices may be enabled to escape. Going back to ancient %0a%3c times, it is a remarkable fact, that in the first Punic War the %0a%3c fleet commanded by Duillius was on the water within sixty %0a%3c days from the time the timber was cut : and, Avhat is still %0a%3c more so, Piso relates that King Hiero had two hundred and %0a%3c twenty ships wholly constructed in forty-five days : in the %0a%3c second Punic War, too, the fleet of Scipio was at sea the fortieth %0a%3c day after the axe had been put to the tree. Such is the %0a%3c energy and dispatch that can be displayed on occasions of %0a%3c emergency. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 75. — ^THE OPINION OF CATO ON THE FELLING OF TIMBEE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Cato,^' a man of consummate authority in all practical mat- %0a%3c ters, expresses himself in relation to timber to the following %0a%3c efiect : — " For making presses, employ the wood of the sappinus %0a%3c in preference.

The fir is pre- %0a%3c ferred for making the masts and sailyards of ships, on account %0a%3c of its comparative liglitness. It is a common feature with %0a%3c these trees, in common with the pine, to have four rows of %0a%3c veins running along the wood^ or else two, or sometimes only %0a%3c one. The heart * of these trees is peculiarly well adapted for %0a%3c joiners' work, and the best wood of all is that which has four %0a%3c layers of veins, it being softer than the rest : men of expe- %0a%3c rience in these matters can instantly form a judgment of the %0a%3c quality from the bark.

In trees, the side which looks towards the north- %0a%3c cast is the most robust, and it is universally the case, that %0a%3c those which grow in moist and damp localities arc of inferior %0a%3c quality, while in those which grow in warm and sunny spots, %0a%3c the wood is more compact and durable ; hence it is, that at %0a%3c Home the fir is preferred that grows on the sliores of the %0a%3c Tyrrhenian Sea to that of the shores of the Adriatic. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are also considerable differences in the qualities of %0a%3c these trees according to the country of their growth : the most %0a%3c esteemed are those of the Alps and the Apennines ; in Gaul, %0a%3c those of Jura'' and Mount Vogesus ; those also of Corsica, %0a%3c 33ithynia, Pontus, and Macedonia; while the firsof ^Enca* and %0a%3c Arcadia are of inferior quality. Those, however, of Parnassus %0a%3c and Eubcea are tlie worst of all, the trees being branchy and %0a%3c knotted, and the wood very apt to rot. As for the cedar, those %0a%3c of Crete, Africa, and Syria are the most esteemed. Wood, if %0a%3c well rubbed with oil of cedar, is proof against wood-worm and %0a%3c decay. The juniper, too, has the same' virtues as the cedar; %0a%3c in Spain it grows to a very considerable size, in the territory %0a%3c of tlie Vaccaei more particularly : the heart of this tree, too, %0a%3c is universally more firm and solid than cedar even. A general %0a%3c fault in all wood is that known as cross-grain, which is formed %0a%3c hy contortions of the knots and veins." In the wood of some %0a%3c trees there are to be found knurs,'* like those in marble ; these %0a%3c knurs are remarkably hard, and offer a resistance like that of %0a%3c a nail, to the great injury of the saw : in some cases, also, they %0a%3c are formed accidentally, from eillier a stone, or tlie branch of %0a%3c another tree lodging there, and being absorbed in the body of %0a%3c the tree. , %0a%3c %0a%3c In the Forum at Megara there long stood a wild olive upon %0a%3c which warriors who had distinguished themselves by their %0a%3c %0a%3c ^ Witli reference to the fir, namely. %0a%3c %0a%3c 7 B. iii. c. 5. « B. iv. c. 3. %0a%3c %0a%3c 5 An additional proof, perhaps, that the cedar of the ancients ia only %0a%3c one of the junipers, and that, as Fee says, they were not acquainted with %0a%3c the real cedar. %0a%3c %0a%3c 1" B. iii. c. 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c 11 " Spiras."

It took the arms of four men to %0a%3c span the girth of this tree, and we not unfrequently hear of %0a%3c the price of masts for such purposes, as being eighty thousand %0a%3c sesterces or more : rafts, too, of this wood are sometimes put %0a%3c together, the value of which is forty thousand. In Egypt and %0a%3c Syria, it is said, the kings, for want of fir, used to employ %0a%3c cedtu-^- for building their ships : the largest cedar that we find %0a%3c mentioned is said to have come from Cyprus, where it was cut %0a%3c to form the mast of a galley of eleven tiers of oars that be- %0a%3c longed to Demetrius : it was one hundred and thirty feet in %0a%3c length, and took three men to span its girth. The pirates of %0a%3c Germanj' navigate their seas in vessels formed of a single tree %0a%3c hollowed^^ out : some of these will hold as many as thirty %0a%3c men. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all woods, the most compact, and consequently the hea- %0a%3c viest, are the ebonj^ and the box, both of them of a slender %0a%3c make. Neither of these woods will float in water, nor, indeed, %0a%3c Avill that of the cork tree, if the bark is removed ; the same is %0a%3c the case, too, with the wood of the larch. Of the other woods, %0a%3c the driest is that of the tree known at Rome as the lotus,^* %0a%3c and next, that of the robur, when the white sap has been re- %0a%3c moved. The wood of the robur is dark, and that of the cy- %0a%3c tisus'^* still more so, approaching, in fact, the nearest of all to %0a%3c the colour of ebony; though there are not wanting writers who %0a%3c assert that the wood of the Syrian terebinth is darker.^® An %0a%3c artist of the name of Thericles is highly spoken of for his skill %0a%3c in turning goblets from the wood of the terebinth : and, indeed, %0a%3c tliat fact is a proof of the goodness of the wood.

Its colour is imitated remarkably well with %0a%3c the walnut and the wild pear, which have its peculiar tint %0a%3c imparted to them by being boiled in colouring liquid. The %0a%3c wood of all the trees of which we have here made mention is %0a%3c firm and compact. Next after them comes the cornel, although %0a%3c it can hardly bo looked upon as timber, in consequence of its %0a%3c remarkable slimness ; the wood of it, in fact, is used for hardlj- %0a%3c any other purpose than the spokes of wheels, or else for mak- %0a%3c ing wedges for splitting wood, and pins or bolts, which have %0a%3c all the hardness of those of iron. Besides these, there are %0a%3c thfe holm-oak, the wild and the cultivated olive, the chesnut, %0a%3c the yoke-elin, and the poplar. This last is mottled simi- %0a%3c larly to the maple, and would be used for joiners' work if wood %0a%3c could be good for anything when the branches are so often %0a%3c lopped : tliat acting upon the tree as a sort of castration, and %0a%3c depriving it of its strength. In addition to these facts, most of %0a%3c these trees, but the robur more particularly, are so extremely %0a%3c hard, that it is quite impossible to bore the wood till it has %0a%3c been soaked in water ; and even then, a nail once driven lioiiie %0a%3c cannot be drawn out again. On the other hand, a nail has no**^ %0a%3c hold in cedar. The wood of the lime is the softest of all, and, %0a%3c as it would appear, the hottest by nature ; a proof of this, they %0a%3c say, is the fact that it will turn the edge of the adze sooner %0a%3c than any other wood.-' In the number, also, of the trees that %0a%3c are hot by nature, are the mulberry, the laurel, the ivy, and %0a%3c all those woods from which fire is kindled by attrition. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 77. — METHODS OF OBTAINING FIKE FROM WOOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c This is a method'*^ which has been employed by the outposts %0a%3c of armies, and by shepherds, on occasions when there has not %0a%3c been a stone at hand to strike fire with. Two pieces of wood %0a%3c are rubbed briskly togcthei', and the friction soon sets them on %0a%3c fire ; which is caught on dry and inflammable substances, fun- %0a%3c guses and leaves being found to ignite the most readily.

A species of wild %0a%3c vine/' too— not the same as the labrusca — which climbs up %0a%3c other trees like the ivy, is highly approved of. The coldest " %0a%3c woods of all are those of the aquatic trees ; but they are tlic %0a%3c most flexible also, and for that reason the best adapted for the %0a%3c construction of bucklers. On an incision being made in them, %0a%3c they will contract immediately, and so close up their wounds, %0a%3c at the same time rendering it more difficult for the iron to pe- %0a%3c netrate : in the number of these woods are the f.g, the willow, %0a%3c the lime, the birch, the elder, and both varieties of the poplar. %0a%3c %0a%3c The lightest of all these woods, and consequently the most %0a%3c useful, are the fig and the willow. They are all of them em- %0a%3c ployed, however, in the manufacture of baskets and other %0a%3c utensils of wicker-work; while, at the same time, they pos- %0a%3c sess a degree of whiteness and hardness which render them %0a%3c very well adapted for carving. The plane has considerable %0a%3c flexibility, but it is moist and slimy like the alder. The elm, %0a%3c too, the ash, the mulberry, and the cherry, are flexible, but of %0a%3c a drier nature ; the wood, however, is more weighty. The %0a%3c elm is the best of all for retaining its natural toughness, and %0a%3c hence it is more particularly employed for socket beams for %0a%3c hinges, and cases for the pannelling of doors, being proof %0a%3c against warping. It is requisite, however, that the beam to %0a%3c receive the hinge should be inverted when set up, the top of %0a%3c the tree answering to the lower hinge, the root to the upper. %0a%3c The wood of the palm and the cork-tree is soft, while that of %0a%3c the apple and the pear is compact. Such, however, is not the %0a%3c case with the maple, its wood being brittle, as, in fact, all %0a%3c veined woods are. In every kind of tree, the varieties in the %0a%3c Avood are still more augmented by the wild trees and the males. %0a%3c The wood, too, of the barren tree is more solid than that of the %0a%3c i'ruit-bearing ones, except in those species in which the male %0a%3c trees bear fruit, the cypress and the cornel, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 78.

HISTORICAL FACTS CONNFCTED WXTII THE DURABILITY %0a%3c %0a%3c OF AVOOD. %0a%3c %0a%3c Of all the woods, the ebony, the cypress, and the cedar are %0a%3c considered to be the most durable, a good proof of which is to %0a%3c be seen in the timber of which the Temple of Diana at Ephesiis %0a%3c is built : it being now four hundred years since it was erected, %0a%3c at the joint expense of the whole of Asia f'^ and, what is a well- %0a%3c known fact, the roof is wholly constructed of planks of cedar. %0a%3c As to the statue of the goddess, there is some doubt of what %0a%3c wood it is made ; all the writers say that it is ebony, with the %0a%3c exception of Muciunus, who was three times consul, one of %0a%3c the very latest among the writers that have seen it ; he de- %0a%3c clares that it is made of the wood of the vine, and that it has %0a%3c never been changed all the seven times tliat the temple has %0a%3c been rebuilt. He says, too, that it was Endagus who made %0a%3c choice of this wood, and even goes so far as to mention the %0a%3c artist's name, a thing that really surprises me very mucli, see- %0a%3c ing that he attributes to it an antiquity that dates before the %0a%3c times of Father Liber, and of Minerva even. He states, also, %0a%3c that, by the aid of numerous apertures, it is soaked witli %0a%3c nard, in order that the moist nature of that drug may preserve %0a%3c the wood and keep the seams^^ close together : I am rather %0a%3c surprised, however, that there should be any seams in tlie %0a%3c statue, considering the very moderate size it is. He informs %0a%3c us, also, that the doors are made of cypress, and that the %0a%3c wood, which has now lasted very nearly four hundred years, %0a%3c has all the appearance of new.^^ It is worthy of remark, too, %0a%3c that the wood of these doors, after the pieces had been glued %0a%3c together, was left to season four years before they were put %0a%3c %0a%3c 32 As\a Minor, namely.

At Saguntum, too, in %0a%3c Spain, there is a temple of Diana, which was brought thither %0a%3c by the original founders of the place, from the island of Zu- %0a%3c cynthus, in the year 200 before the taking of Troy, Jiocchus %0a%3c says — It is preserved beneath the town, they say. Hannibal, %0a%3c being induced thereto by feelings of religious veneration, %0a%3c spared this temple, and its beams, made of juniper, are still %0a%3c in existence at this very day. But the most memorable in- %0a%3c stance of all is that of the temple which was dedicated to the %0a%3c same goddess at Aulis, several ages before the Trojan War : of %0a%3c what wood, however, it was originally built is a fact that has %0a%3c been long lost in oblivion. Speaking in general terms, we %0a%3c may say that those woods are of the greatest durability which %0a%3c are the most odoriferous.^^ %0a%3c %0a%3c Next to those woods of which we have just spoken, that of %0a%3c the mulberry is held in the highest degree of esteem, and it %0a%3c will even turn black when old. There are some trees, again, %0a%3c that are more durable than others, when employed for certain %0a%3c purposes. The wood of the elm lasts the best in the open air, %0a%3c that of the robur when buried in the ground, and that of the %0a%3c fpiercus when exposed to the action of water : indeed, the %0a%3c wood of this last, if employed in works above ground, is apt %0a%3c to split and warp. The wood of the larch thrives best in the %0a%3c midst of moisture ; the same is the case, too, with that of the %0a%3c black alder. The wood of the robur spoils by exposure to the %0a%3c action of sea- water. The beech and the walnut are far from %0a%3c disapproved of for constructions under water, and, in fact, %0a%3c these are the principal woods, too, that are used for works %0a%3c %0a%3c 33 One of the earliest appellations, probably, of Jupiter amon? the Ro- %0a%3c mans.

(41.) VAEIETIES OF THE TEREDO. %0a%3c %0a%3c There are four kinds of insects that attack wood. The %0a%3c teredo has a head remarkably large in proportion to the other %0a%3c part of the body, and gnaws away the wood with its teeth : %0a%3c its attacks, however, are confined solely to the sea, and it is %0a%3c generally thought that this is the only insect that is pro[)erly %0a%3c so called. The wood- worm that prevails on the land is known %0a%3c as the " tinea," while those which resemble a gnat in appear- %0a%3c ance are called " thripes." The fourth kiud of wood-worm %0a%3c belongs to the maggot class ; some of them being engendered %0a%3c by the corruption of the juices of the wood itself, and others %0a%3c being produced, just as in the trees, by the worm known as %0a%3c the cerastes.^" AVhen this worm has eaten away enough of %0a%3c the wood to enable it to turn round, it gives birth to another. %0a%3c The generation of these insects is prevented, however, by the %0a%3c bitterness that exists in some woods, the cypress, and the %0a%3c hardness of others, the box, for instance. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is said, too, that the fir, if barked about the time of bud- %0a%3c ding, and at the period of the moon already mentioned," wiU %0a%3c never spoil in water.

(42.) — THE WOODS USED IN BUILDINR. %0a%3c %0a%3c "We have in Italy some woods that are apt to split of %0a%3c themselves : to prevent this, architects recommend that they %0a%3c should be first seasoned in manure" and then dried, in order %0a%3c to render them proof against the action of the atmosphere. %0a%3c The woods of the fir and larch are well adapted, even when %0a%3c used transversely, for the support of heavy burdens ; while the %0a%3c robur and the olive are apt to bend and give way under a %0a%3c weight. The wood of the poplar and the palm are also strong, %0a%3c but this last will bend, though in a manner different from %0a%3c the others ; for, while in all other instances the wood bends %0a%3c downwards, in the palm it bends in the contrary direction," %0a%3c and forms an arch. The woods of the pine and the cypress %0a%3c are proof against decay and all attacks of wood-worm. The %0a%3c walnut is easily warped, but we sometimes see beams even %0a%3c made of it. It gives warning, however, before it breaks, by a %0a%3c loud cracking noise ; such was the case at Antandros, at the %0a%3c public baths there — the bathers took the alarm upon hearing %0a%3c the beams crack, and made their escape. The pine, the pitch- %0a%3c tree, and the alder are employed for making hollow pipes for %0a%3c the conveyance of water, and when buried in the earth will %0a%3c last for many years. If, however, they are not well covered %0a%3c over, they will very soon rot ; and the resistance they offer to %0a%3c decay will increase in a most surprising degree if the outer %0a%3c surface as well is left in contact with the water. %0a%3c %0a%3c There is nothing very surprising in this, as most woods are preserved %0a%3c hetter when completely immersed in water, than when exposed to the va- %0a%3c riations of the atmosphere. %0a%3c %0a%3c *3 He borrows this fable from Theophrastus, B. v. c. 5. %0a%3c %0a%3c This process, Fee says, would he attended with no success. %0a%3c *5 It is not quite clear whether he intends this observation to apply to the %0a%3c poplar and the palm, or to the last only. It is true, however, in neither %0a%3c case, and is contrary, as Fee observes, to all physical laws. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 83.] %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c WOODS UNITED WfTII GLUE. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 427 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 82. — CAEPENTEES' WOODS. %0a%3c %0a%3c The wood of the fir is strongest in a vortical position : it %0a%3c is remarkably well adapted for the pannels of doors, and all %0a%3c kinds of in-door joiners' work, whether in the Grecian, the %0a%3c Campanian, or the Sicilian style. The shavings of this wood %0a%3c when briskly planed, always curl up in circles like the tendrils %0a%3c of the vine. This wood, too, unites particularly well with %0a%3c glue : it is used in this state for making vehicles, and is found %0a%3c to split sooner in the solid parts than in a place where the %0a%3c pieces have been glued together. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 83. (43.) WOODS UNITED WITH GLtTE, %0a%3c %0a%3c Glue, too, plays one of the principal parts in all veneering %0a%3c and works of marqueterie. For this purpose, the workmen %0a%3c usually employ wood with a threaded vein, to which they give %0a%3c the name of " ferulea," from its resemblance to the grain of %0a%3c the giant fennel," this part of the wood being preferred from %0a%3c its being dotted and wavy. In every variety there are some %0a%3c ■woods to be found that will not take the glue, and which re- %0a%3c fuse to unite either with wood of the same kind or of any %0a%3c other; the wood of the robur for example. Indeed, it is %0a%3c mostly the case that substances will not unite unless they are %0a%3c of a similar nature ; a stone, for instance, cannot be made to %0a%3c adhere to wood. The wood of the service-tree, the yoke-elm, %0a%3c the box, and, in a less degree, the lime, have a particular %0a%3c aversion to uniting with the cornel. All the yieldiiig woods %0a%3c which we have already spoken** of as flexible readily adapt %0a%3c themselves to every kind of work ; and in addition to them, %0a%3c the mulberry and the wild fig. Those which are moderately %0a%3c moist are easily sawn and cut, but dry woods are apt to give %0a%3c way beyond the part that is touched by the saw ; while, on %0a%3c the other hand, the green woods, with the exception of the %0a%3c robur and the box, offer a more obstinate resistance, filling the %0a%3c intervals between the teeth of the saw with sawdust, and %0a%3c rendering its edge uniform and inert; it is for this reason %0a%3c that the teeth are often made to project right and left in turns, %0a%3c %0a%3c « The resistance that woods offer when placed vertically is in the same %0a%3c ratio as that presented hy tliem when employed horizontally.

The wood, too, of the holm-oak is cut into veneers %0a%3c of remarkable thinness, the colour of which is far from un- %0a%3c sightly ; but it_ is more particularly where it is exposed to %0a%3c friction that this wood is valued, as being one to be depended %0a%3c upon ; in the axle-trees of wheels, for instance ; for which the %0a%3c ash is also employed, on account of its pliancy, the holm-oak %0a%3c for its hardness, and the elm, for the union in it of both %0a%3c those qualities. There are also various workman's tools made %0a%3c of wood, which, though but small, are still remarkably useful : %0a%3c in this respect, it is said that the best materials for making %0a%3c auger handles are the wild olive, the box, the holm-oak, the %0a%3c elra, and the ash. Of the same woods also mallets are made ; %0a%3c the larger ones, however, are made of the pine and the holm- %0a%3c oak. These woods, too, have a greater degree of strength and %0a%3c hardness if cut in season than when hewn prematurely ; indeed, %0a%3c it has been known for hinge-jambs, made of olive, a wood of %0a%3c remarkable hardness, after having remained a considerable %0a%3c time on the spot, to put out buds*' like a growing plant. Cato" %0a%3c recommends levers to be made of holly, laurel, or elm ; and %0a%3c Hyginus speaks highly of the yoke-elm, the holm-oak, and %0a%3c the cerrus, for the handles of agricultural implements. %0a%3c %0a%3c The best woods for cutting into layers, and employing as a %0a%3c %0a%3c " See c. 24. %0a%3c %0a%3c 50 Fee thinks, from the context, that the meaning is, that the vine wns %0a%3c employed m the construction of chariots ; it depends entirely on the nunt- %0a%3c tuation adopted. ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c =1 This could only have happened in the first year that they wore so %0a%3c e°>ployed. 52 De lie Rust. c. 31. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Chap. 85.] THE AGE OE TREES. 429 %0a%3c %0a%3c veneer for covering others, are the citrus, the terebinth, the %0a%3c different varieties ot tlie maple, the box, the palm,^' the holly %0a%3c he holm-oak, the root of the older, and the poplar.

It was in this appearance that originated %0a%3c that requirement of luxury which displays itself in covering %0a%3c one tree vvith another, and bestowing upon the more common %0a%3c woods a bark of higher price. In order to make a single %0a%3c tree sell many times over, laminae of veneer have been de- %0a%3c vised ; but that was not thought sufficient— the horns of ani- %0a%3c mals must next be stained of different colours, and their teeth %0a%3c cut into sections, in order to decorate wood with ivorj^ and, %0a%3c at a later period, to veneer it all over. Then, after all this, man %0a%3c must go and seek his materials in the sea as well ! For this %0a%3c purpose he has learned to cut tortoise-shell into sections ; and %0a%3c of late, in the reign of Nero, there was a monstrous invention %0a%3c devised of destroying its natural appearance by paint, and %0a%3c making it sell at a still higher price by a successful imitation %0a%3c of wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c It is in this way that the value of our couches is so greatly %0a%3c enhanced ; it is in this way, too, that they bid the rich lustre of %0a%3c the terebinth to be outdone, a mock citrus to be made that %0a%3c shall be more valuable than the real one, and the grain of the %0a%3c maple to be feigned. At one time luxury was not content %0a%3c with wood ; at the present day it sets us on buying tortoise- %0a%3c shell in the guise of wood. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 85. (44.) THE AGE OF TKEES.

There are %0a%3c certain vegetable productions which cannot be propagated in %0a%3c the ground, and which grow nowhere but on trees ; having no %0a%3c domicile of their own, they live upon others ; such, for instance, %0a%3c is the case with the mistletoe, and a herb that grovrs in Syria, %0a%3c and is known as the " cadytas."'^ This last entwines around %0a%3c not only trees, but brambles even ; in the neighbourhood of %0a%3c Tempe, too, in Tliessaly, there is found a plant which is called %0a%3c "polj-podion the dolichos'** is found also, and wild thj-me.'^ %0a%3c After the wild olive has been pruned there springs up a jjlant %0a%3c that is known as " phaulias while one that grows upon the %0a%3c %0a%3c " To its great detriment, probably. %0a%3c %0a%3c Fee says that no holm-oak is ever known to attain this size. %0a%3c " See c. 62. %0a%3c %0a%3c " Sprcngcl says that this is the parasitic plant, which he calls Cassyta %0a%3c filiformis.

That which %0a%3c grows upon the fir and the larch has the name of*' stclis in %0a%3c Euboea ; and there is the hyphear®' of Arcadia. It grows %0a%3c also upon the quercus,^^ the robur, the holm-oak, the wild %0a%3c plum, and the terebinth, but upon no other tree.'^ It is most %0a%3c plentiful of all upon the quercus, and is then known as %0a%3c " adasphear." In all the trees, with the exception of the holm- %0a%3c oak and the quercus, there is a considerable difference in its %0a%3c smell and pungency, and the leaf of one kind has a disagree- %0a%3c able odour ; both varieties, however, are sticky and bitter. %0a%3c The hj-phear is the best for fattening*^ cattle with ; it begins, %0a%3c however, by purging off all defects, after which it fattens all %0a%3c such animals as have been able to withstand the purging. It %0a%3c is generally said, however, that those animals which have any %0a%3c radical malady in the intestines cannot withstand its drastic %0a%3c effects. This method of treatment is generally adopted in the %0a%3c summer for a period of forty days. %0a%3c %0a%3c Besides the above, there is yet another difference*'' in the %0a%3c mistletoe ; that which grows upon the trees which lose their %0a%3c leaves, loses its leaves as well ; while, on the other hand, that %0a%3c which grows upon evergreens always retains its leaves.

THE METHOD OF MAKING BIRDLIME. %0a%3c %0a%3c Birdlime is made of the berries of the mistletoe, which are %0a%3c gathered at harvest, and while in an unripe state ; for if the %0a%3c rainy season comes on, though they increase in size, the viscous %0a%3c juice is apt to lose its virtues. They are then dried,''' and %0a%3c when brought to a state of perfect aridity, are first pounded, %0a%3c and then put in water, in which they are left to rot for twelve %0a%3c days ; this being, in fact, the only thing that finds improve- %0a%3c ment in decay. After this, they are again beaten in running %0a%3c water with a mallet, and after losing the outer coat there is %0a%3c only the viscous inner pulp remaiuing. This substance is %0a%3c birdlime ; and after it has been thinned by the addition of %0a%3c Avalnut oil, it is found particularly useful for catching birds, %0a%3c it being quite sufficient if they only touch it with the wings. %0a%3c %0a%3c CHAP. 95. niSTOKlCAL FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE MISTLETOE. %0a%3c %0a%3c Upon this occasion we must not omit to mention the ad- %0a%3c miration that is lavished upon this plant by the Gauls. The %0a%3c Druids— for that is the name they give to their magicians^"— %0a%3c held nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree %0a%3c that bears it, supposing always that tree to be the robur.^^ %0a%3c Of itself the robur is selected by them to form whole groves, %0a%3c and they perform none of their religious rites without em- %0a%3c ploying branches of it ; so much so, that it is very probable %0a%3c that the priests themselves may have received their name %0a%3c %0a%3c are more likely to adhere to the bark of trees, and so find a nidus for ger- %0a%3c mination. „ , , . f 1 I 4. %0a%3c %0a%3c The exact opposite is the case, the female being the fruittui plant. %0a%3c 9» The method used in Italy for making bhd-linie is very similar at the %0a%3c %0a%3c present day. .'\'^^'''S°!\^ ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c »' DecandoUe was of opinion, that the mistletoe ot the Druids was not %0a%3c u viscum, but the Loranthus Europxus, which is much more commonly %0a%3c %0a%3c f'uuud on oaks. ^ %0a%3c %0a%3c r F 2 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c 436 %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c Flint's natiual history. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c [Book XVl. %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c %0a%3c from the Greek name"'- for that tree. In fact, it is the notion %0a%3c with them that everything that grows on it has been sent %0a%3c immediately from heaven, and that the mistletoe upon it is a %0a%3c proof that the tree has been selected by God himself as an %0a%3c object of his especial favour. %0a%3c %0a%3c The mistletoe, however, is but rarely found upon the robur; %0a%3c and when found, is gathered with rites replete with religious %0a%3c awe. This is done more particularly on the fifth day of the %0a%3c moon, the day which is the beginning of their months and %0a%3c 3-ears, as also of their ages, which, with them, are but thirty %0a%3c years. This day they select because the moon, though not %0a%3c yet in the middle of her course, has already considerable %0a%3c ])0wer and influence ; and they call her by a name which sig- %0a%3c nifies, in their language, the all-healing.^^ Having made all %0a%3c due preparation for the sacrifice and a banquet beneath the %0a%3c trees, they bring thither two white bulls, the horns of which %0a%3c are bound then for the first time. Clad in a white robe the %0a%3c priest ascends the tree, and cuts the mistletoe with a golden %0a%3c sickle, which is received by others in a white cloak.''* They %0a%3c then immolate the victims, offering up their prayers that God %0a%3c will render this gift of his propitious to those to whom he has %0a%3c so granted it.
