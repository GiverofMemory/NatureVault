I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a%0aTed meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a%0aGarlic seed amd escaped garlic [[https://danbrisebois.com/2012/07/11/looking-for-true-garlic-seed/|#]] growing garlic from true seed article [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]] garlic seed update [[https://danbrisebois.com/2012/11/29/true-garlic-seed-update/|#]] year later update [[https://danbrisebois.com/2013/10/10/2013-true-garlic-seed-update/|#]]%0a%0aGarlic seed exchange forum [[http://alanbishop.proboards.com/thread/5471/true-garlic-seed|#]] and open source plant breeding forum [[https://opensourceplantbreeding.org/forum/|#]] garlic [[https://opensourceplantbreeding.org/forum/index.php/topic,15.0.html|#]]%0a%0aGarlicana avram in youtube video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f03vEf_neR0|#]]%0a%0aGarlic cloves grow bigger with more nutrients in the soil.

Each year all the varieties that flower and go to seed, the seeds will be combined and labeled "NV" for "NatureVault" then the year the seeds were harvested.  So seeds harvested this year would be NV2023.  Each year all the varieties that go to seed will be recorded.%0a%0aFor example lets say I get chesnok red, Navatria, Pavonis, and Asthshe to go to seed.  I would then write somewhere (maybe on this page):%0a%0a*NV2023%0a**Chesnok Red%0a**Navatria%0a**Pavonis%0a**Asthshe%0a%0aThen for later generations if using previous years seeds 2025 may look like:%0a%0a*NV2025%0a**NV2023%0a**Bei Ilai%0a%0aThis would mean seeds harvested in 2025 are from NV2023 seed progeny plus I added Bei Ilai cloves to the garden as well.  In reality You probably won't be able to harvest seeds from seed progeny from the previous year, since garlic usually needs 2 years to produce seeds after being grown from seed itself.%0a%0aThere probably will not be new seeds released every year, NV2023 might continue to be offered in 2024 and there might not be a seed harvest every year, possibly every other year.%0a%0a!!!!!Names%0a%0a!!!!Planting%0a%0a!!!!!2023 notes%0a%0aTwo circular areas, northeast (NE) corner of east plot (plot 1) labeled 1.1, SE 1.2, SW 1.3, NW 1.4.

I've talked with him quite a bit and will offer an answer in case no one more qualified does! Mind you, I am in early stages of the work but may be able to help. So...for softnecks, I'll remind you of something Avram mentioned early- in some climates or conditions, some of them will bolt. In my Zone 5 climate just below 43 degrees north, I regularly have some accessions of Artichoke or Silverskin types bolt. Typically no more than 30%25 of a population. For many, the scape-emergence signal that the plant receives (from cold, stress, etc) is too close to the bulbil formation signal, so bulbils form and swell while the scape still hasn't emerged from the top two leaves. In that case, you simply have no access to remove the bulbils and assist any true flowers. However, if the scape does emerge, then theoretically, it has a chance. None of Avram's commercially available types are from the softneck types but I don't know if that means he's never gotten any from them. His climate is more mild than mine, and he is more experienced with fertility (which connects to the stress-induced bolting response) so I think he sees less bolting than I do. Hope that helps! PS- it's also useful to note that random scrambling of hardneck genes (i.e. in open pollination) may rediscover the combination in genes that most often lead to "being" a softneck (which again, is just a tendency and very plastic to environment.) Hope that helps.%0a%0a2 years ago%0aAs a small scale grower, selling softnecks comes down to advertising their storage abilities- 10-18 months. Large scale growers in mild climates like them because there is no labor to remove scapes, a byproduct that has very little shelf life. I hope Avram pops on here and offers his opinion, but I'd say in my opinion, if you want to breed garlic to result in another softneck type, as a northern grower it'd be nice if we got one with lower clove counts. Artichokes and Silverskins often produce 12-18 cloves, that are proportionally small to cloves of say, German White or Spanish Roja. For me, overwinter survival tracks closely with seed clove size, so for a winter-hardy softneck, a bulb with fewer, larger cloves would be nice. Customers often prefer larger clove size, too, and reject current softnecks for that reason. I don't know enough about the garlic genome to know if that's possible- we're asking it to develop a trait that so far is only seen under selective pressure of very cold winters- the same thing most likely to trigger the (presumably epigenetic/environmental) response to bolt under stress.%0a%0a2 years ago%0aCoincidentally, my best results in getting Northern-adapted softnecks have been through sheer stubbornness of replanting Artichoke types year after year even with heavy winter losses, until lower cloves per bulb started to happen. Garlic is a fascinating plant- I've read somewhere (I forget where) that the size of a genome partly determines its plasticity for epigenetic behavior- and garlic has one of the larger genomes for an allium species. After enough near-permanent stress from my winters, I have some types that make 6-8 cloves (and yes, frequent partial bolting) instead of 12-14, and after a big dip in bulb yields in the first several years, they are starting to size up reasonably. So...the inherent plasticity of the garlic can be enough to do a remarkable amount of adapting. That being said, the true seed project is really exciting and I'm hoping lots of people do all kinds of tinkering for their local climates. One thing I wonder about is if the seeds themselves receive any epigenetic influence depending on the climate they're grown in- if during the embryonic development itself, environment could allow for some genes to be turned on or off depending on the mother plant's experience.%0a%0a!!!Suppliers%0a%0aorganic heirloom [[https://organicheirloomgardens.com/garlic/|#]]%0a%0a!!!Types%0a%0a!!!!Porcelin%0aivan [[https://southernseedgarlic.com/garlic/ivan#reviews|#]]%0a%0a!!!Nutrients%0asee [[NPK]], [[sulfur]], [[selenium]]%0a%0a[[Sulfur]] [[https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/cropnews/2020/03/crop-sulfur-fertilization-spring|#]] high in manure%0a%0acaring for garlic [[https://gradentalunfarm.net/pages/garlic-growing-101|#]] plant first frost, [[upstate NY farming]] october 15th.%0a!!Links%0a%0aOral bacteria [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6454914/|#]].%0a%0aGarlic through out history and medical text and its use for [[heart]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC139960/|#]] lowers [[high cholesterol]], [[high blood pressure]], [[blood sugar]], and [[heart palpitations]] [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC139960/pdf/1475-2891-1-4.pdf|#]]%0a%0aGarlic and [[onion]] reverse [[cadmium]] [[heavy metal]] induced [[kidney]] damage [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18521705/|#]] [[sperm]] [[fertility]] [[testicle]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18824205/|#]] [[prostate]] possibly [[prostate cancer]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25476781/|#]] [[liver]] [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19082532/|#]]%0a%0a%0a[[!Biologics]]%0a%0a

I started with many varieties from the USDA collection at Pullman, WA and from others obtained widely. By a certain manipulation in early flowering, some clones produced true seed, with sexual recombination. These were germinated through embryo rescue and new, virus-free garlics were created. These were selected for fertility, vigor and bulb and clove characters. Several generations of seed production were followed by clonal selection. The breeding and selection were carried out in Southwestern Oregon. So, now, year 2011, I have 29 different clones, put into 10 groups for release and sale for the very first time! These garlics appear to fit in the Rocambole group and they have a rich, well-rounded outstanding flavor. Their scapes become very tall and develop several loops. They are robust, vigorous and appear virus-free. Some have giant cloves, with few per bulb. Others have smaller, but more numerous cloves. All are hardnecks. They are identified by groups, A-J, and by numbers within each group. A photo of representative samples of each group can be seen on this site."%0a%3c %0a%3c Ted meridith guide to true garlic seed [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Garlic seed amd escaped garlic [[https://danbrisebois.com/2012/07/11/looking-for-true-garlic-seed/|#]] growing garlic from true seed article [[https://garlicseed.blogspot.com/p/growing-garlic-from-true-seed.html|#]] garlic seed update [[https://danbrisebois.com/2012/11/29/true-garlic-seed-update/|#]] year later update [[https://danbrisebois.com/2013/10/10/2013-true-garlic-seed-update/|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Garlic seed exchange forum [[http://alanbishop.proboards.com/thread/5471/true-garlic-seed|#]] and open source plant breeding forum [[https://opensourceplantbreeding.org/forum/|#]] garlic [[https://opensourceplantbreeding.org/forum/index.php/topic,15.0.html|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Garlicana avram in youtube video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f03vEf_neR0|#]]%0a%3c %0a%3c Garlic cloves grow bigger with more nutrients in the soil.

I've talked with him quite a bit and will offer an answer in case no one more qualified does! Mind you, I am in early stages of the work but may be able to help. So...for softnecks, I'll remind you of something Avram mentioned early- in some climates or conditions, some of them will bolt. In my Zone 5 climate just below 43 degrees north, I regularly have some accessions of Artichoke or Silverskin types bolt. Typically no more than 30%25 of a population. For many, the scape-emergence signal that the plant receives (from cold, stress, etc) is too close to the bulbil formation signal, so bulbils form and swell while the scape still hasn't emerged from the top two leaves. In that case, you simply have no access to remove the bulbils and assist any true flowers. However, if the scape does emerge, then theoretically, it has a chance. None of Avram's commercially available types are from the softneck types but I don't know if that means he's never gotten any from them. His climate is more mild than mine, and he is more experienced with fertility (which connects to the stress-induced bolting response) so I think he sees less bolting than I do. Hope that helps! PS- it's also useful to note that random scrambling of hardneck genes (i.e. in open pollination) may rediscover the combination in genes that most often lead to "being" a softneck (which again, is just a tendency and very plastic to environment.) Hope that helps.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2 years ago%0a%3c As a small scale grower, selling softnecks comes down to advertising their storage abilities- 10-18 months. Large scale growers in mild climates like them because there is no labor to remove scapes, a byproduct that has very little shelf life. I hope Avram pops on here and offers his opinion, but I'd say in my opinion, if you want to breed garlic to result in another softneck type, as a northern grower it'd be nice if we got one with lower clove counts. Artichokes and Silverskins often produce 12-18 cloves, that are proportionally small to cloves of say, German White or Spanish Roja. For me, overwinter survival tracks closely with seed clove size, so for a winter-hardy softneck, a bulb with fewer, larger cloves would be nice. Customers often prefer larger clove size, too, and reject current softnecks for that reason. I don't know enough about the garlic genome to know if that's possible- we're asking it to develop a trait that so far is only seen under selective pressure of very cold winters- the same thing most likely to trigger the (presumably epigenetic/environmental) response to bolt under stress.%0a%3c %0a%3c 2 years ago%0a%3c Coincidentally, my best results in getting Northern-adapted softnecks have been through sheer stubbornness of replanting Artichoke types year after year even with heavy winter losses, until lower cloves per bulb started to happen. Garlic is a fascinating plant- I've read somewhere (I forget where) that the size of a genome partly determines its plasticity for epigenetic behavior- and garlic has one of the larger genomes for an allium species. After enough near-permanent stress from my winters, I have some types that make 6-8 cloves (and yes, frequent partial bolting) instead of 12-14, and after a big dip in bulb yields in the first several years, they are starting to size up reasonably. So...the inherent plasticity of the garlic can be enough to do a remarkable amount of adapting. That being said, the true seed project is really exciting and I'm hoping lots of people do all kinds of tinkering for their local climates. One thing I wonder about is if the seeds themselves receive any epigenetic influence depending on the climate they're grown in- if during the embryonic development itself, environment could allow for some genes to be turned on or off depending on the mother plant's experience.%0a
