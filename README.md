# NatureVault - Saving the Worlds Knowledge

## Instructions

* Download this and place in the "htdocs" or "public" folder of your server.
 * I like to use (don't forget the period after): git clone https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault.git .
* Make sure you check config.php and modify url's and directory references (like upload directory) to reflect your host's folder structure.
* You need to FTP using filezilla to set permissions of the wiki/wiki.d folder (by right clicking it and setting permissions) and all contents to allow public write so people can login to the wiki.
* For personal hosting Abyss Web server works well.
